            "title": "Automating Data Science",
            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nData science is concerned with the extraction of knowledge and insight, and ultimately societal or economic value, from data. It complements traditional statistics in that its object is data as it presents itself <em>in the wild</em> (often complex and heterogeneous, noisy, loosely structured, biased, etc.), rather than data well-structured data sampled in carefully designed studies.\n</p> \n <p>\nSuch 'Big Data' is increasingly abundant, while the number of skilled data scientists is lagging. This has raised the question as to whether it is possible to automate data science in several contexts. First, from an artificial intelligence perspective, it is related to the issue of \"robot scientists\", which are concerned with the automation of scientific processes and which have so far largely focused on the life sciences. It is interesting to investigate whether principles of robot scientists can be applied to data science.\n</p> \n <p>\nSecond, there exist many results in the machine learning community, which has since the early 1980s been applying machine learning at a meta-level, in order to learn which machine learning algorithms, variants and (hyper-)parameter settings should be used on which types of data sets.\n </p> \n <p>\nIn recent years, there have been breakthroughs in this domain, and there now exist effective systems (such as Auto-WEKA and auto-sklearn) that automatically select machine learning methods and configure their hyperparameters in order to maximize the predictive performance on particular datasets.\n </p> \n <p>\nThird, there are projects such as the Automated Statistician that want to fully automate the process of statistical modeling. Such systems could dramatically simplify <em>scientific data modeling</em> tasks, empowering scientists from data-rich scientific disciplines such as bioinformatics, climate data analysis, computational social science, and so on. To ensure success, important challenges not only from a purely modelling perspective, but also in terms of interpretability and the human-computer interface, need to be tackled. For example, the input to the Automated Statistician is a dataset, and the system produces not only a complex statistical model by means of a search process, but also explains it in natural language.\n</p> \n <p> \nFourth, there is an interest in not only automating the model building step in data science, but also various steps that precede it. It is well known in data science that 80% of the effort goes into preprocessing the data, putting it in the right format, and selecting the right features, whereas the model-building step typically only takes 20% of the effort. This has motivated researchers to focus on automated techniques for data wrangling, which is precisely concerned with transforming the given dataset into a format that can be handled by the data analysis component. Here, there are strong connections with inductive programming techniques.\n </p> \n <p>\nFifth, as it is often easier for non-expert users to interpret and understand visualisations of data rather than statistical models, work on automatic visualisation of data sets is also very relevant to this Dagstuhl seminar.\n</p> \n <p> \nFinally, an interesting and challenging research question is whether it is possible to develop an integrated solution that tackles all these issues (as is the topic of the ERC AdG SYNTH).\n</p> \n <h3>Overview of the seminar</h3> \n <h4>Structure of the seminar</h4> \n <p>\nThe seminar was structured as follows. The mornings were generally dedicated to presentations (short tutorials on day one), whereas the afternoons were generally dedicated to discussions such as plenary discussions, smaller-group breakout sessions, and flex time that was kept open prior to the seminar. The flex time ended up being dedicated to a mix of presentations and breakout sessions.\n</p> \n <h4>Challenges in automating data science</h4> \n <p>\nOn day one, a range of challenges for research on automating data science were identified, which can be clustered around the following six themes:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> <b>Automating Machine Learning (AutoML)</b><br/>\nMain challenges: computational efficiency; ensuring generalization also for small data; make AutoML faster and more data-efficient using meta-learning; extending ideas from AutoML to exploratory analysis / unsupervised learning.\n</li><li> <b>Exploratory data analysis and visualization</b><br/>\nMain challenges: the fact that there is there is no single or clearly defined objective; help the user make progress towards an ill-defined goal; (subjective) interestingness of an analysis, a pattern, or a visualization; integrate machine learning and interaction in exploration; exploration of data types beyond simply tabular; veracity of visualizations; how to quantify progress and measure success; the need for benchmarks.\n</li><li> <b>Data wrangling</b><br/>\nMain challenges: extend the scope of AutoML to include data wrangling tasks; user interfaces to provide intuitive input in data wrangling tasks; how to quantify progress and measure success; the need for benchmarks.\n</li><li> <b>Automation and human-centric data science (explainability, privacy, fairness, trust, interaction)</b><br/>\nMain challenges: build-in privacy and fairness constraints in automatic data science  systems; the dangers of ignorant usage of automated data science systems; different levels of expertise benefit from different degrees of automation; optimizing the performance of the combined human/machine `team'; determine when and where the human must be involved; definition or criteria for explainability; risk that automation will reduce explainability and transparency; explainability to whom -- a data scientist or layperson?\n</li><li> <b>Facilitating data science by novel querying and programming paradigms</b><br/>\nMain challenges: interactive data models to help users gain intuitive understanding; declarative approaches for data analysis, querying, and visualization; a query language for automated data science.\n</li><li> <b>Evaluation</b><br/>\nMain challenges: robust objective measures for data science processes beyond predictive modelling; subjective measures: measures that depend on the user background and goals; evaluation of the entire data science pipeline versus individual steps; reproducibility in the presence of user interactions.\n</li></ol> \n <h4>Topics discussed in depth</h4> \n <p>\nThese identified challenges were then used to determine the program of the rest of the seminar. Talks were held on partial solutions to a range of these challenges. In addition, breakout discussions were held on the following topics:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> The relation between data-driven techniques and knowledge-based reasoning.\n</li><li>  Data wrangling.\n</li><li>  Beyond the black-box: explainability.\n</li><li>  Automation of exploratory / unsupervised data science tasks, and visualization.\n</li><li>  Automating data science for human users.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nAlong with abstracts of the talks, detailed discussions of the main ideas and conclusions of each of these breakout sessions are included in this Dagstuhl report.\n </p> \n <h3>Discussion and outlook</h3> \n <p>\nAutomating data science is an area of research that is understudied as such. AutoML, as a subarea of automating data science, is arguably the first subarea where some remarkable successes have been achieved. This seminar identified the main challenges for the field in translating these successes into advances in other subareas of automating data science, most notably in automating exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and related tasks, integrating data and knowledge-driven approaches, and ultimately the data science process as a whole, from data gathering to the creation of insights and value.\n </p> \n <p>\nFurther developing automated data science raises several challenges. A first challenge concerns the evaluation of automated data science methods. Indeed, the possibility to automate is preconditioned on the availability of criteria to optimize. A second key one is how to ensure that automated data science systems remain Human-Centric, viewing humans as useful allies and ultimate beneficiaries. This can be achieved by designing effective user-interaction techniques, by ensuring explainability, and by ensuring privacy is respected and individuals are treated fairly. These are basic requirements for ensuring justified trust in automated data science systems, and thus key drivers to success.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Tijl De Bie, Luc De Raedt, Holger H.

            "title": "Computational Interactivity",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as a whole has been tremendously successful in the past both in terms of growth and impact of the premier academic conferences and in reshaping the IT industry. However, as we enter the post-PC era new technologies emerge and bring new challenges along that the traditional user-centered-design approach is not well equipped to meet. For example, artificial intelligence, wearable computing, augmented and virtual reality and custom interactive devices enabled by emerging digital fabrication technologies pose increasingly wicked challenges for interaction design, where designers must consider the entire stack from low-level hardware, through software all the way to the human factors, implying that it is no longer feasible to abstract away technology and hence design spaces that explode in their complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn June 2016 we assembled a group of 25 researchers to discuss aspects relating to a computational view of interactions. Through a series of talks, breakout discussions and panel discussions we established a broad consensus that HCI can and should be approached via a computational lense. We also identified several areas in which computational models are already being used to answer HCI research questions and to move the field forward. However, it became clear that the area is in its infancy and that much work is necessary to turn computational HCI into one of the mainstream approaches in the larger research community. Primarily, researchers and students need to begin thinking in computational terms (abstraction, modelling, automation) and need to learn how to incorporate such thinking into the typically more design driven thinking prevalent in current research. Furthermore, it was also discussed at length how state-of-the-art methods in numerical optimization and machine learning can advance HCI research and likewise how HCI research can identify and refine research requirements in these adjacent research communities. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn terms of concrete outcomes, many of the present researchers agreed to contribute to a forthcoming book on \u201ccomputational interaction\u201d and to write a joint overview article further refining the discussions and outcomes of the Dagstuhl seminar. In summary, a very fruitful and productive seminar led to interesting and in-depth discussions and provided starting points for much collaborative and community-driven future work. We also identified the need for further community building work including establishing of recurring workshops, symposia, and similar outlets, outreach via summer-schools, tutorials and other educational efforts as well as establishment of a sub-committee at ACM SIGCHI the premier venue for HCI research.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Xiaojun Bi, Otmar Hilliges, Takeo Igarashi, and Antti Oulasvirta\n                </div> \n",

Finding efficient algorithms for solving computational tasks is crucial for practical applications and becomes even more important with the use of computers becoming part of everyday life. Despite a long line of research, for many problems that arise in practice it is not known if they can be solved efficiently - in particular in polynomial time.\n</p> \n <p>\nBeside questions about the existence of polynomial time algorithms for problems like Satisfiability or Factoring where the best known algorithms run in exponential time, there is a huge class of practical problems where algorithms with polynomial running time (e.g. cubic or even quadratic time) are known, but it would be important to establish whether these running times are best possible, or to what extent they can be improved.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese fundamental questions motivate developments in various areas from algorithm design to circuit complexity, communication complexity and coding theory. During this Dagstuhl Seminar, we discussed some of the most exciting recent developments in those areas related to computational complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar \"Computational Complexity of Discrete Problems\" has evolved out of the series of seminars entitled \"Complexity of Boolean Functions,\" a topic that has been covered at Dagstuhl on a regular basis since the foundation of this research center.  \nAn important feature of the current research in computational complexity is the integration of ideas from different subareas of computational complexity and from other fields in computer science and mathematics. We have aimed to attract researchers from various subareas connected to core questions in boolean function complexity and foster further fruitful interactions.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anna G\u00e1l, Michal Kouck\u00fd, Oded Regev, and Till Tantau\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nLanguage is used for many purposes, both private and public. When speech or text is directed to wide audiences, it often aims at influencing stances, opinions, and dispositions of readers. This can be done by relatively transparent, rational argumentation, but also in considerably more subtle ways, by phrasing utterances in such a way that the underlying intent is noticed by readers more in passing \u2013 or not consciously at all. This is the realm of \u201cframing\u201d, which concerns the careful selecting of the aspects of an event to be reported (those that fit the goal of letting a positive or negative evaluation shine through); the choice\nof terms that carry an inherent evaluation (e.g., \u201cthe frugal four\u201d versus \u201cthe stingy four\u201d in recent EU negotiations); and employing stylistic devices that correspondingly support the purpose (e.g., a monotonic versus a lively rhythm). Framing has been studied for quite some time, from many different perspectives, and it has also been covered by popular science books. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that definitions and emphasis differ quite a bit between and even within disciplines \u2013 the notion of framing can itself be framed, too.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe computational research on language processing has addressed some of the linguistic purposes mentioned above: Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are well-established fields; argumentation mining has more recently caught much attention and is in the process of \"settling down\". Framing, being less transparent at the linguistic surface, has seen only very few attempts\nat formal modelling so far. The proposers of this seminar are convinced, however, that a computational treatment of framing is a central next step \u2013 extending opinion and argument analysis - and its operationalization calls for a deeper understanding of the term and the underlying mechanisms. Before computational theories can be formulated and applications be built, the potential contributions by the various relevant disciplines (sociology, political science, psychology, communication science, and others) should be studied carefully and assessed for potential common ground. This is the first purpose of the proposed seminar, and the second is the follow-up step of\ndeveloping a roadmap for productive computational research toward the automatic identification of framing in text and speech, and modelling the connection to the underlying reasoning processes.

            "title": "High Throughput Connectomics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nOur workshop brought together experts in the computational aspects of connectomics. A week of lectures and work-group meetings in a lively and collegial environment led to a collection of interesting conclusions. One big idea that was put forth in the meeting was the gargantuan effort of reconstructing a complete mouse brain. Another was to completely map the white matter connectivity of a mammalian brain. We also discussed which techniques/pipelines we should continue to pursue as a community. In that vein one big conclusion was that you have to have both the engineers and software working on a pipeline; distributing software only is not sufficient (you need dedicated engineers to run the software, it can't be based just on grad students). Zeiss reported on a multibeam 331 beam microscope that was in the making. There were also discussions on quality measures and metrics for connectomics reconstruction, and on developing standardized datasets for segmentation training and comparison of algorithms (scaling up from current day small datasets). Finally, there were discussions on the ethics and policies in the area going forward -- Should we rely more on industrial partners to provide compute power and storage, or is it better to keep most of the research in universities and non-for-profit research institutes.\n</p> \n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nThe sheer complexity of the brain means that sooner or later the data describing brains must transition from something that is rather easily managed to something far less tractable. This transition appears to now be underway. The accumulation of ever-bigger brain data is a byproduct of the development of a number of new technologies that provide digitized information about the structural organization (anatomy) and the function of neural tissue. These new collection approaches bring novel data into neuroscience that potentially bears on many poorly understood aspects of the nervous system. Fundamental scientific questions such as the way learned information is instantiated in the brain and how brains change over the course of development and aging are likely to be usefully addressed in the coming decades as large data sets mapping networks of neurons at high resolution become available.\n </p> \n <p>\nMapping networks of neurons at the level of synaptic connections, a field called connectomics, began in the 1970s with a the study of the small nervous system of a worm and has recently garnered general interest thanks to technical and computational advances that automate the collection of electron-microscopy data and offer the possibility of mapping even large mammalian brains. However, modern connectomics produces `big data', unprecedented quantities of digital information at unprecedented rates, and will require, as with genomics at the time, breakthrough algorithmic and computational solutions.\n</p> \n <p>Unfortunately the generation of large data sets is actually the easy part. Our experience in the nascent field of connectomics indicates that there are many challenges associated with the steps after data acquisition, that is, the process of turning the data into a mineable commodity. This workshop will focus on addressing these challenges by bringing together researchers developing algorithms and deploying software systems that enable high-throughput analysis of connectomic data.\n</p> \n <p>While high-throughput connectomics must tackle many of the problems that occur in big data science and engineering, tremendous differences in data size, computational complexity, and the problem domain will require novel computational frameworks, algorithms, and systems. Input image data in connectomics is reaching, even in its initial stages, petabytes in size at a terabytes-per-hour rate, and currently requires millions of cycles of computation per pixel. Such data is not easily moved or stored, and so on-the-fly analysis of the data as it comes off the microscope is the most likely future solution. Achieving the kind of throughput that will allow us to process the data at the rate at which it is being generated necessitates a three orders of magnitude reduction in cycles per pixel, compared to the status quo. Furthermore, there is locality to the data. Unlike other big data problems, which can often be represented as independent key-value pairs spread across many machines, reconstruction of neural circuits requires frequent data exchanges across adjacent image regions. Buffering all the data in machine memory is infeasible, as is data replication on multiple servers. That means one cannot rely on Moore's law and parallelism across data centers to solve this problem--we need to be smarter.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn a nutshell, a connectomics data set is a collection of images taken on a volume of brain tissue that has been sectioned into many thousands of small slices, each only a few tens of nanometers thick. These slices are then imaged using custom electron microscopes to produce an image stack that will in the near future reach petabytes in size. Using one of the standard electron microscopy pipeline approaches, the key computational problems that must be addressed in order to turn the raw acquired digitized images into a useful form of ``onnectivity graph'' are stitching, alignment, neuron reconstruction, and synapse detection. Each digitized image tile needs to be stitched together with neighboring tiles to form a composite image of a slice. Then, the stitched slice image is aligned with the previous and subsequent slice images. Despite being mostly similar, image alignment is challenging because typically a conveyor belt collects the slices and each may rotate a few degrees, or stretch depending on its thickness. Fortunately, because of the high image resolution, alignment is practical, as axons and dendrites are readily visible in cross-section and can be traced from one section to the next. A second challenge is that, once the image data is aligned, the sectioned objects must be individuated. In these data sets, the objects are neurons and other cellular entities that are interwoven in the three-dimensional space of the sample tissue. The reconstruction of neural processes as they pass from one section to the next is directly related to the computer vision problem of obtaining a segmentation of an image series, that is, the labeling of pixels in the images according to which cell they belong to.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough considerable progress has been achieved in computer-based image segmentation in the last few years, reliable automatic image segmentation is still an open problem. Automating the segmentation of connectomic data is challenging because the shapes of neural objects are irregular, branching, non-repeating and intertwined. Moreover, the actual number of different objects and their synaptic interconnections in a volume of brain tissue is unknown and, at the moment, even difficult to estimate or bound. Segmentation of a standard electron microscopy image is further complicated by the fact that the range of pixel intensity values of cell membranes overlaps with that of other organelles. Thus, simple thresholding to find cell boundaries does not work.\n</p> \n <p>In the eyes of many, the term big data is synonymous with the storage and analysis of massive collections of digital information. The ``big'' refers to the size of the input sets, typically ranging in the tens or even hundreds of terabytes, and arriving at rates of several tens or hundreds of gigabytes per second. In connectomics, the size of the input set is at the high end of the big data range, and possibly among the largest data ever acquired. Images at several nanometers resolution are needed to accurately reconstruct the very fine axons, dendrites, and synaptic connections. At this resolution, a cubic mm is about 2 petabytes of data. A complete rat cortex including some white matter might require 500 cubic mm and thus would produce about an exabyte (1000 petabytes) of data. This amount is far beyond the scope of storage that can be handled by any system today (as a reference point, consider that Walmart or Aldi's database systems manage a few petabytes of data). A complete human cortex, 1000-times that of a rodent, will require a zetabyte (1000 exabytes) of data, an amount of data approaching that of all the information recorded in the world today. Obviously this means that the goal of connectomics will not be to acquire complete human brains and that for the near future one must consider reconstructions of neuronal substructures as opposed to whole brains. Moreover, it is clear that as we go beyond a few millimeters, one cannot store the raw data: it must be analyzed on the fly as it comes off the microscope and then discarded, keeping the physical tissue sample for re-imaging if needed.\n</p> \n <p> \nWhat is this on-the-fly acquisition rate? The new multi-beam electron microscopes currently produced by Carl Zeiss LLC have a staggering throughput approaching 400 sections per day or a terabyte of data per hour, placing them at the far end of the big data rate spectrum. This rate, if it can be matched with appropriate reconstruction algorithms, will allow researchers to process a cubic mm of rodent brain, that is, 2 petabytes of data, in about 6 months operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWhatever computational pipeline is used to extract the connectomics graph from the image data, it will eventually have to work on the fly, at the pace of the microscope that generates this data.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe algorithms and computational techniques for developing such high throughput connectomics pipelines are the target of this workshop. The massive amounts of storage and computation require expertise not only in computational neurobiology, machine learning, and alignment techniques, but also in parallel computation, distributed systems, and storage systems. There are several groups of researchers around the world that specialize in collecting the electron microscopy datasets, and several that engage in developing matching computational pipelines. Our aim is to bring these researchers together for an extended 5-day brainstorming session. We will also invite some top researchers in related fields such as machine learning, computer vision, distributed systems, and parallel computing. Our goal for this meeting is to both build an understanding of the state of the art in high-throughput connectomics pipelines, and to brainstorm on how to move the field forward so that high throughput connectomics systems become widely available to neurobiology labs around the world. \n </p> \n <p>\nConcretely, we would like to come out of this workshop with a hierarchical plan for future connectomics systems that solve existing systems' problems. We will begin the workshop by having workgroups discuss these problems in existing systems and then dedicate the latter part to collectively working out solutions. We will consider three levels:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>The system layer: how data is stored, moved around and computed on in a distributed and parallel fashion.\n</li><li>The pipeline layer: how processing progresses from stitching through alignment and reconstruction.\n</li><li> The algorithm layer: the specific machine learning and error detection and correction algorithms used in various pipeline stages to bring the datasets to analyzable connectivity graphs.\n</li></ol> \n <p>Our plan is to discuss each of these in detail, with the hope of concluding the workshop with a coherent plan on how to proceed.\n</p> \n <h3>Relation to previous Dagstuhl seminars</h3> \n <p>To the best of our knowledge there have been no similar Dagstuhl seminars in the past. The field of connectomics is a young cutting edge big data research area that will have important implications on both computation in the sciences (and in particular on the use of large scale machine learning in the sciences) and on artificial intelligence (through the development of new neural network models based on the neurobiological discoveries this research may lead to). We believe it is important for modern computer science to engage in such interdisciplinary applications of computing and algorithms and we are therefore eager to initiate this new seminar direction.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nir Shavit\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Computational Creativity Meets Digital Literary Studies",
            "data": "\n <p>\nLiterary studies (LS) is a subfield of the humanities that provides a diversity of possible views on its objects of investigation. The universal approach to literary texts does not exist, instead there are many, sometimes incompatible theories that can be applied for the interpretation of literary texts. Additionally, with the emerging of the Digital Humanities (DH) the deployment of computational methods has been introduced into LS, leading to a further expansion of the range of theories and methodologies of text analysis and interpretation. Against that backdrop in the last decade much effort has especially been put into developing approaches that cover rather complex concepts for text analysis, including, among other, network theory (e.g., [7]) and approaches from distributional semantics for topic modelling and word vector estimation (e.g., [8]). This considerably changed the prerequisites of DH research in the field of LS. In many cases it is no longer possible to simply apply a predefined tool or algorithm, requiring traditionally trained LS scholars to move away from their disciplinary paradigm of individual research and towards adapting collaborative modes that can provide both LS and computational expertise. Researchers in Natural language processing (NLP) have\nshown considerable interest in text-based DH research. This interest is not only motivated by the diversity and complexity of the research questions, which offers an ideal testbed for the development of new methods and combined workflows, but also by the nature of texts found in the context of these research questions which are often diverse with respect to their lexical and syntactic range \u2013 meeting the need for this type of data in work aiming\nfor more flexible NLP approaches. Computational Creativity (CC) is a multidisciplinary endeavour, modelling, simulating or replicating aspects of creativity using a computer, in order to achieve one of several ends: Either to construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity, or to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behaviour in humans, or to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves (a concise overview\nof the main aspects of the field has, for instance, been laid out by [1]). One of CC\u2019s most popular subfields is Computational Storytelling (CS), where researchers hitherto have mainly thought about the structure and logical implications of building blocks of stories, leaving most other dimensions of narrative construction out of consideration.\n</p> \n <p>Taking stock of this overall state of affairs and the specific situation in the respective fields, the seminar was constructed around several main challenges:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> One of the major challenges in DLS is the approximation of concepts with computational approaches to, i.e. their operationalization, that not only requires a translation of the concepts, but also a deep understanding of the deployed computational approaches used. This gap can be tackled best by providing expertise from the fields concerned. Whereas NLP is already accepted as such a field (but still needed), CS has not been taken much into consideration yet. A second type of collaboration that still needs to be intensified is the one that connects the interpretative, manual annotations from DLS (e.g., [4]) with computational approaches to text analysis and generation. \n</li><li>NLP has focused on a limited variety of texts in its beginnings and suffers from a bias towards newspaper texts. Even though there are efforts towards more diverse and flexible text processing, the constant lack of data is a problem. DH and CC offer a variety of texts to improve this situation \u2013 but are hitherto underused in that capacity. \n</li><li>CC, CS focuses almost exclusively on plot and logical structure of storytelling. However, a narrative is a complex web of different factors that are well-investigated in classical disciplines. While much work is based on formalist theories about narrative (especially [9]), other approaches from narrative theory still need to be explored better. For example, CS could benefit from the well-established fields of semiotics (e.g., [5]) and structuralism (e.g., [3]) as well as from more recent, reader-oriented developments in cognitive and empirical narratology (e.g. [6]; [2]).\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn order to make researchers from the participating communities a) aware of the challenges and the corresponding opportunities an interdisciplinary meeting like the seminar offered, and b) make them take advantage of these opportunities still on-site, the seminar was split between presentations from researchers describing their recent work and questions they wanted to highlight for the audience, and ``hackathon'' phases in which decidedly interdisciplinary teams of participants worked on concrete projects. \n</p> \n <p>The following pages summarize the content of these presentations and the outcomes of the group projects.</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>M.

            "data": "\n <p>\nWe brought together 15 in-person attendees at Schloss Dagstuhl, with a roughly equal number of remote\nattendees.  Remote attendance was challenging, particularly for attendees from very different time-zones. It\nnonetheless provided the opportunity for us to hear from a wider selection of participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe decided up-front not to try to cater the schedule to remote participation. Given the number of time zones\ncovered by the participants, we continue to believe that, although it clearly had adverse impacts, it was the right\ndecision.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe had a number of remote presentations that included interactions with the speakers. Otherwise the discussion\ntended to happen mostly among the in-person participants, in spite of the excellent AV systems at Dagstuhl.\nMany remote participants were limited in attendance due to time-zone issues.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur area is perhaps unique, in that it includes deep theoretical work, but is also very dependent on technological\ndevelopments. Accordingly, the participants of the seminar were from a spectrum of topics ranging from theory\nof distributed systems to hardware specification and design. The seminar gave many of us the opportunity to\ncatch up on both theory and practice, including input from some participants with more direct insights into\nindustrial developments.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe began the seminar by reviewing some of the underlying assumptions that were made by prior work in this\nfield, often without certainty about their correctness. We were actually able to get much more shared clarity on a\nfew of these as a result of audience discussion during the seminar. Some of us learned that non-volatile caches\nare being publicly discussed by Intel, and that there also is similar agreement that memory encryption, to restore\nvolatility when needed, is desirable.  We also learned that writes to the same cache line are not just believed by\nsoftware researchers to reach memory in the correct order, but at least one hardware vendor also agrees. Though\nthis last fact is rather obscure, it is important for some NVM algorithms, and not normally reflected in hardware\nmanuals.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe rest of the seminar consisted of talks and group discussions. Three talks were longer overview talks on\ndifferent aspects (Michael Scott on buffered persistency, Parosh Aziz Abdulla on verification, and Erez Petrank on\npersistent lock-free data structures). We did not feel the need for smaller break-out sessions, since the in-person\ngroup was quite small, largely due to our timing with respect to Covid waves. Much of the benefit here appears to\nhave been in listening to discussions that often were either significantly more theoretical or significantly more\npractical than our own research.\n</p> \n <p>\nNVM programming is both complicated by, and often synergistic with concurrent programming. Much of our focus\nwas on the interaction between the two. Due to these close interactions, we asked several speakers to talk about\nconcurrency issues that seemed particularly relevant (e.g., Peter Sewell on Armv8-A virtual memory model, Mark\nBatty on novel solution to the ``thin air problem'', and Paul McKenney on weak memory schemes used in the\nLinux kernel).\n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral talks raised questions on the foundations of the field, such\nas what are the hardware-supplied programming models, or what it means\nfor a persistent program to be correct. It is entirely possible that\nmost future NVM programmers will be more concerned with something like\nthe persistent transactions discussed in Michael Bond's talk. However,\ngiven the relative immaturity of the area and foundational\nuncertainty, the emphasis seemed appropriate.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Hans-J.

Despite the increasing importance of such programs, there are relatively few tools that are focussed on ensuring that functional programs possess crucial correctness properties. While language based verification for\nimperative and first-order programs has been studied for decades yielding important ideas like Floyd-Hoare Logics, Abstract Interpretation, and Model Checking. It is only relatively recently, that researchers have proposed language based verification tools {e.g. advanced type systems, contract systems, model checking and higher-order program analyses for functional and higher-order programs.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe organised this seminar to bring together the different schools of researchers interested in software reliability, namely, the designers and implementers of functional programming languages, and experts in software verification, in order create a larger community of researchers focused on\nthis important goal, to let us compare the strengths and limitations of different approaches, to find ways to unite both intellectually, and via tools  the complementary advantages of different techniques, and to devise challenging open problems and application areas where verification may be most effective.To this end, the seminar comprised a program of 30 talks from the leading experts on the above topics, and breakout sessions on:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Integrating formal methods tools in the curriculum\n</li><li> Hands on Tool Tutorials\n</li><li> User Interaction\n</li><li> Types and Effects\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marco Gaboardi, Suresh Jagannathan, Ranjit Jhala, and Stephanie Weirich\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar \"Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms: Theory and Practice\" on May 2-6, 2022 brought together 19 international experts in estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs). Their research ranged from a theoretical perspective, e.g., runtime analysis on synthetic problems, to an applied perspective, e.g., solutions of industrial optimization problems with EDAs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main aim of the seminar was to narrow the gap between theory and practice in EDAs by bringing together researchers from both sides and stimulating interaction. We facilitated this interaction through longer introductory talks, e.,g., on theoretical analyses of EDAs, regular conference-style talks, short flash talks presenting open problems and stimulating discussions and, last but not least, through various breakout \nsessions and group work. After each talk, we scheduled ample time for discussion, and even adapted the schedule when discussions had gained momentum and took longer than expected. On the last day of the seminar, all participants joined a 1-hour plenum discussion summarizing the findings of the seminar, discussing open problems and identifying further research topics.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe that the seminar has achieved its main aims by making a step towards narrowing the gap between theory and practice in EDAs. This is witnessed by the high number of spontaneous talks given by the participants, allowing almost everyone to present his/her perspective on EDAs, high and stable attendance of participants at talks and group sessions, and lively discussions after basically every talk as well as in the dedicated discussion fora. Several participants shared the feedback with us that they learned new aspects of EDAs during the seminar and had increased their understanding of what the other side (theory/practice) was interested in.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar also identified several open problems related to the design, analysis, and application of EDAs. Details can be found in the summary of the concluding plenum discussion (see further below in the report).\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, several participants reported to the organizers that the seminar had helped them to understand current challenges in the theory and practice of EDAs, that they had extended their professional network, and drawn inspiration from the seminar for new research ideas. They also expressed interest in attending a similar seminar in the future.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe only downside of this seminar was that several colleagues, most notably from China, could not attend because of the still ongoing sanitary crisis.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Josu Ceberio Uribe, Benjamin Doerr,  and Carsten Witt\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Opportunities and Risks of Blockchain Technologies",
            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar \"Opportunities and Risks of Blockchain Technologies\" had 21 participants from universities, public institutions, and enterprises. Blockchain is both an information technology as well as an economic innovation. As a technical innovation it is a new version of a distributed transactional database technology, especially suited for decentralized environments of limited or imperfect trust. As an economic innovation it offers novel tools to any problem domain where there exists a need for a reliable record of transactions in a decentralized environment where not all parties, whether humans or machines, can be fully trusted.\n</p> \n <p>\nComputer scientists have researched key issues of blockchain technologies such as technical availability, tools, standards, and applications that enable these networks. Our seminar aimed to bridge the gap between this research stream and research perspectives from Service Science, Wirtschaftsinformatik, and Information Systems. We brought together a multi-disciplinary group of academic and industry researchers; specifically those working in fields such as open platforms, open source, distributed trust platforms, cryptocurrency tools, as well as the related social and legal challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe set to analyze and synthesize the current body of knowledge on the emerging landscape of blockchain technologies. We linked the emerging phenomenon of cryptographic economic systems to already established research streams around trust-related issues in payment systems, online currencies, and supply chain management through group work and keynotes. We worked on four theme groups:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Research centers\n</li><li> Blockchain and Fintech\n</li><li> Essence and future of blockchain technologies\n</li><li> Impact/changing institutions\n</li></ol> \n <p>In the following we look at each of these shortly. The full report contains a number of position papers that explore these issues in further detail.\n</p> \n <h3>Research centers</h3> \n <p>The research center work group sought ways of strengthening the European and global research on blockchain. A starting point was a proposal to form a network of similar minded Blockchain experts and research groups across Europe. Several groups from countries such as in Denmark, Ireland, UK, and Switzerland could start as a loosely coupled interest group to work on potential research agendas and teaching curricula. The Blockchain seminar at Dagstuhl can be regarded as the starting point for the formation of the research network. Based on this network, the next step would be to convince funding agencies and industry to write research proposals for the DRAO (Distributed Research Autonomous Organization). The idea of DRAO is that the Blockchain research center should not be just another research center, doing research on Blockchain, but actually should be based on Blockchain, as a distributed autonomous research organization.\n</p> \n <p>\nFurthermore, the group discussed a proposal for Blockchain teaching and education. This would result in a suite of courses on various areas, possibly as follows:\n</p> \n <p>Computer Science Foundations</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Cryptography, authentication and signature methods. \n</li><li> Distributed computing, distributed algorithms, understanding of the tradeoffs, consensus protocols\n</li><li> Distributed systems\n</li><li> Domain specific languages for contracts and for protocols. \n</li><li> Large scale software engineering for distributed ledger development, software engineering \n</li><li> Program analysis and software quality, objective way of verifying properties\n</li></ul> \n <p>Information Systems Economics</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Economic theories on incentive models, auctions and mechanism design (basically game theory insights)\n</li><li> Inter-organizational, distributed governance and management theories\n</li><li> Collective economies, reputation and trust management\n</li><li> Digital Mindset and management of digital personas\n</li><li> Ethics and critical reflections of Blockchain and societal implications\n</li></ul> \n <p>Information Systems Management and Organization</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Innovation Design: from Blockchain idea to prototype\n</li><li> Digital Entrepreneurship: from Blockchain prototypes to markets\n</li><li> Taxation, auditing and integration of Blockchain in organizations\n</li></ul> \n <p>IT Law</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Legal implications of Blockchain, property rights, ownership, responsibilities \n</li></ul> \n <h3>Blockchain ans Fintech</h3> \n <p>\nOur second worgroup dealt with the relationship between Blockchain and the Fintech industry. The group produced a matrix of different financial and legal functions, tools required to handle those and the potential of Blockchain to replace solutions to these functions.\n</p> \n <h3>Essence and Future of Blockchain Technologies</h3> \n <p>The workgroup on the essence of blockchain technologies set out to understand what forms the core of the technology. Its preliminary definition is that a blockchain implementation should contain First, the data storage that implements a distributed ledger system (DLS), the actual Blockchain, which is the data structure used in DLS is a hash-linked chain of blocks. A block is a collection of transactions that form the ledger. Furthermore, a Consensus Mechanism allowing for (de-)Centralization of power to decide which transactions are valid in the network. The innovative combination of the above mentioned three components give DLS interesting characteristics that we describe in the next section.\n</p> \n <h3>Impacts/changing institutions</h3> \n <p>This workgroup set out to understand the relationship between technical change and social change. It tried chart the relationship of blockchain and institutions. The discussion centered around the resilience of institutions and the need for stop gap measures, which are often provided by quite traditional public infrastructures and legal frameworks. In some cases, institutions will have to put conditions in place to allow blockchain to work (in particular to avoid harm). The idea of Blockchain being able to replace or eliminate trust was a central topic and it was noted that this can be an issue in cases of fraud (e.g. Ethereum fork as an example). The group also discussed who provides stable identifiers and who decides what can be stored in a given ledger. Similarly, the assignment of value and ownership and their control remain important issues that are now seen as tertiary to the technology. Key questions arising from this were:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> How will blockchain solutions that work well in theory or as prototypes function when used as large-scale solutions?\n</li><li> Are certain groups or communities better suited to adopt blockchain?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Final comments</h3> \n <p>We believe that despite some hiccups (e.g., DAO fork) blockchain will emerge as an important technological and economical phenomenon. Its key properties and impacts should be studied intensively to allow for new innovations in the financial sector and other areas, where the technology\u2019s affordances promise to create value. The work continues through a manifesto in Business &amp; Information Systems Engineering, a viewpoint in Communications of the ACM, and a special issue in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Juho Lindman, Roman Beck, Christian Becker, and Matti Rossi\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Conditional Logics and Conditional Reasoning: New Joint Perspectives",
            "data": "\n <p>\nLogic in the first half of the 20th century has been mostly concerned with mathematical reasoning and providing a unified framework for the foundations of mathematics. In the second half of the 20th century, with the emergence of artificial intelligence, new formalisms have been introduced to model kinds of inference closer to everyday life.\n</p> \n <p>\n\"Commonsense reasoning\", the reasoning that humans perform in everyday life, is significantly different from the reasoning of mathematicians, which has been the object of study of (mathematical) logic for a long time. It is very rich and includes different kinds of reasoning, such as counterfactual reasoning, default reasoning or uncertain and plausible reasoning. Commonsense reasoning is often captured by means of conditionals, which are sentences of the form `if A then B'. These conditionals can also be of various kinds: counterfactual, indicative, or subjunctive. The benefits of conditionals for formalizing commonsense reasoning are basically twofold: first, they can encode reasoning patterns of various types if one chooses suitable semantics or calculi, and second, they provide a common syntactic element that can be used to relate and compare the different kinds of commonsense reasoning as well as the mathematical reasoning.\n</p> \n <p>\nConditionals are also studied in the psychology of reasoning, which has recently witnessed a new wave of work. In particular, an effort to confront semantic frameworks with empirical results has been made. In parallel, a number of mathematical advances have been made in modal logic, an area closely related to conditional logics. However, the techniques developed in modal logic with respect to proof theory and correspondence theory have not fully been applied to the conditional logics introduced in artificial intelligence and philosophy. The main objective of this seminar was to provide an opportunity for computer scientists, logicians, psychologists, linguists and philosophers  working on that topic to meet and reinforce their ties over several days in the Dagstuhl castle.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe  focused on three specific issues which were discussed and worked out in three different working groups. First, we investigated how people's  intuitions about 'counterpossibles' can be understood empirically and classified  thanks to   the theoretical accounts of   conditional logics.  Second, we reconsidered  the various semantics of the basic system P  and wondered   to which extent  pragmatics  plays a role in the relevance relation between the antecedant and the consequent of a conditional. Third, we strove to apply the  recent advances in   proof theory and correspondence theory to  conditional logics.  These three topics correspond respectively to the   working groups \"Investigating people's intuitions about counterpossibles (Section 4.1), \"The semantics of conditionals\" (Section 4.2) and \"Correspondence theory and proof theory for conditional logics\" (Section 4.3).\n</p> \n <p>\nThese working group discussions were preceded by 13 short talks and 3 tutorials: \"Semantics of Conditionals\" (by Graham Priest), \"Proof Theory of Conditionals\" (by Nicola Olivetti) and \"The psychology of Indicative Conditionals\" (by Karolina Krzyzanowska). These talks and tutorials  are summarized in Section 3. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Guillaume Aucher, Paul Egr\u00e9, Gabriele Kern-Isberner, and Francesca Poggiolesi\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Encouraging Reproducibility in Scientific Research of the Internet",
            "data": "\n <p>\nReproducibility in scientific research is a means to not only achieve\ntrustworthiness of results, but it also lowers barriers to technology\ntransition [1] and accelerates science by promoting incentives to data sharing.  The networking research community however pays limited attention to the importance of reproducibility of results, instead tending to accept papers that appear plausible. Previous studies [2,3,4] have shown that a fraction of published papers release artifacts (such as code and datasets) that are needed to reproduce results. In order to encourage reproducibility of research, practitioners continue [5,6,7,8,9] to do service to educate the community on the need for this change. To provide incentives to authors, vehicles for publication of software and datasets are also emerging.  For instance, Elsevier\nSoftwareX [10] is a new journal designed to specifically publish\nsoftware contributions.  DataCite [11,12] provides mechanisms for supporting methods to locate and cite datasets. Community Resource for Archiving Wireless Data (CRAWDAD) [13] and Information Marketplace for Policy and Analysis of Cyber-risk &amp; Trust (IMPACT)Cyber Trust [14] provide an index of existing measurement data to not only enable new research but also advance network science by promoting reproducible research. Traditional conferences bestow best dataset awards and actively solicit submissions that reproduce results. SIGCOMM Computer Communication\nReview (CCR) allows authors to upload artifacts during paper\nsubmission to allow reviewers to check for reproducibility, and relaxes page\nlimits for reproducible papers.  Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has\nrecently introduced a new policy [15] on result and artifact review and badging. The policy identifies a terminology to use to assess results and artifacts.  ACM has also initiated a new task force on data, software and reproducibility in publication [16] to understand how ACM can effectively promote reproducibility within the computing research community. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine with a goal to move towards the open science ecosystem has recently (2018) released a report [17] with guidance and concrete recommendations on how to build strategies for achieving open science. The target is to ensure the free availability (and usability) of publications and associated artifacts.  The The National Science Foundation (NSF) is taking substantial steps [18] in this area whereby submitted proposals are required to provide a results dissemination plan to describe how produced research results are made available to the extent necessary to independently validate the findings. Towards this end, the proposal budget [19] may request funds for the costs of documenting, preparing, publishing or otherwise making a available to others the findings and products of the work conducted under the NSF grant.  Despite these continued efforts, reproducibility of research exist as an ongoing problem and few papers that reproduce existing research get published [20,21,22] in practise.\n\n</p> <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>\nIn this seminar, we discussed challenges to improving reproducibility of\nscientific Internet research, developed a set of recommendations that we as a\ncommunity can undertake to initiate a cultural change toward increased\nreproducibility of our work.  The goal of the seminar was to discuss the\nquestions below and to propose recommendations that would improve the state of\nreproducibility in computer networking research.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>What   are   the   challenges   with   reproducibility?</b><br/>\n   How can researchers (and data providers) navigate concerns\n    with openly sharing datasets? How  should  we  cope  with  datasets  that\n    lack  stable  ground  truth?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe first category of questions tried to identify the challenges with\nreproducibility [23]. For instance, concerns with\nopenly sharing datasets led to discussions around legal restrictions and the\nadvantages of researchers keeping data private for their own exclusive future\nuse. Another consideration is double-blind review practices, which require\nthat authors expend effort to obfuscate the source of their data.  Would this\ntime be better spent documenting the datasets for sharing to enable\nreproducibility? A \"gap analysis\" discussion to understand whether the problem\nis a lack of appropriate venues or lack of stable ground truth, or more\nbroadly a lack of incentive to reproduce research since publishing (and\nfunding) agents tend to prefer novelty was held. There is also the inherent\nrisk of confirmation bias of existing results; discussion of ideas on how to\ntrain young researchers to recognize and counter this tendency was sought.\n\n</p> <ul>\n<li><b>What   incentives   are   needed   to   encourage\n    reproducibility?</b><br/> What can publishers do? What can\n    conference organisation committees do? How can we ensure that reviewers\n    consider reproducibility when reviewing papers? How can we manage and\n    scale the evaluation of artifacts during peer review? Do we need new\n    venues  that  specifically  require  reproducibility  of  the  submitted\n    research?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe second category of questions is about incentives. Questions about how\npublishers can promote reproducibility framed discussions on whether\npublishers can provide storage for authors to upload data artifacts with the\nassociated paper in digital libraries, or whether mechanisms can be developed\nto highlight reproducible (and reproduced) papers. Questions on how conference\norganisation committees can inspire ideas for additional incentives (such as\nbest dataset awards or relaxing page limits) for authors to make research\nreproducible. We identified questions to add to review forms to ensure\nreviewers pay attention to reproducibility aspects. This further lead to\ndiscussions on whether committees (in parallel to the regular technical\nprogram committee) should evaluate artifacts during the conference review\nprocess. Should such a committee be composed of purely young researchers or a\nblend of young and senior researchers? Questions on the need for specific\nvenues triggered discussions on whether high-impact journals need to establish\nfeature topics on reproducibility or devote a dedicated column for papers that\nreproduce existing research.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>What   tools   and   systems   are   available   to facilitate\n      reproducibility?</b><br/>\n How effective are emerging interactive\n    lab notebook tools (e.g., Jupyter) at facilitating reproducibility? Should\n    ac{CS} course curricula integrate use of these tools for student projects\n    to help develop skills and habits that enable reproducibility?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe third category of questions attempt to identify and review tools and\nsystems that are available to facilitate reproducibility. Enormous interest\nhas developed recently in tools for recording experimental observations and\ncomputational analytics on large data sets. Some researchers now document the\nentire process for a paper in a Jupyter lab notebook, greatly facilitating\nreproducibility and extension of the research.  The learning curve for these\ntools may be daunting; we discussed how faculty can evolve ac{CS} course\ncurricula to integrate use of these tools for student projects to help develop\nskills and habits that enable reproducibility.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>What   guidelines   or   (best   practises)   are   needed\n    to   help   reproducibility?</b><br/> How can we ensure authors\n    think about reproducibility? What guidelines would  assist  reviewers  in\n    evaluating artifacts?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe fourth category of questions attempts to develop guidelines (or best\npractises) to promote reproducibility of research. For instance, we discussed\nwhat language could be added to Call for Papers (CFP) to encourage authors to describe\nreproducibility aspects (of both measurements and results) in their paper\nsubmissions.\n</p> \n <h3>Structure</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar lasted 2.5 days. The seminar began with an introductory round\nwhere each participant presented one slide to give an overview of their\nexperience that is relevant for the seminar and a set of open questions that\nthe participant wished to discuss during the event. These slides were\ncollected from each participant before the seminar. We had one invited talk\n(\u00a7 3.1) that we used as a basis for triggering\ndiscussions and identifying areas for group work, while a major portion of the\nseminar time was dedicated to breakout sessions, whereby participants were\nsplit into small groups to discuss specific themes and develop ideas with\nconsensus to propose to larger groups. The morning sessions the following day\nwere dedicated to continuing parallel group work with presentations that\nreported the outcomes of each breakout session from the previous day. In the\nafternoons, we dedicated some time for seven minute lightning talks to invite\nideas for subsequent breakout sessions. One evening, we had a social dinner\nactivity.  The afternoon of the third day was spent reviewing and collecting\nfeedback from the participants and to initiating follow up actions identified\nduring the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Henning Schulzrinne.

            "title": "Mobility Data Analysis: From Technical to Ethical",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMobility data is one of the fastest growing types of data, thanks to the increasing number of mobile devices approaching the population of the globe. The collection, storage and analysis of spatio-temporal data representing trajectories of moving objects is one of the topics that received major attention in the field of data analytics. The more semantic information is collected from various sources, the richer is movement data. This enriched mobility data is typically referred to as semantic trajectories. The analysis of such trajectories can produce powerful results in domains such as transportation, security, tourism, health, environment and even policy design. The recent COVID-19 outbreak shed a light on the importance of collecting mobility data for public health. However, at the same time, the more mobility data is enriched with semantics, the larger the risks of violating the privacy of users and of possible unethical uses of these data analysis results. Aspects of Computational Ethics  include privacy, but they go beyond this, towards a more general vision of ethical gathering, processing, uses of data and the results of data analyses. How ethics interrelates with mobility data analysis is an emerging issue.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe objective of this Dagstuhl Seminar was therefore to start a deep interacting discussion between Mobility Data Analysis researchers and Ethics experts to link these two fields with the objective of creating the foundations of a new Mobility Data Ethics research field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar, \norganised by Chiara Renso, Bettina Berendt and Stan Matwin\nas an activity from and beyond the MASTER project [1]\naimed at bringing together researchers from different disciplines from Computer Science, Mobility Analysis and Ethics to trace the path from a technical vision of mobility Analysis to an also ethics-based approach to the field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe three-day seminar was structured into three main modules: (1) round-table presentations in which each participant presented him/her self with a question about Mobility and Ethics that represents his/her interest and an object to visualise this interest or serve as a starting point for further discussion; (2) three tutorial on \"technical\", \"ethical\" and \"legal\" aspects of mobility data; (3) the working groups to discuss the main topics of interest that emerged during phases (1) and (2). \n</p> \n <p>\nAs a result of the group discussions on participants' interests and the issues raised in the tutorials, we formed five main working groups:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>  What is/are the trade-off(s) between data privacy and data utility? \n</li><li>  Mobility Data Anonymity (Can location data be really anonymous?) \n</li><li>  Ethics of Mobility Data: What is unique? Which guidelines? \n</li><li> Mobility Data Analysis Ethics beyond the data\n</li><li> Mobility Data Analysis Ethics beyond humans only: Tracking animals and moral agency\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe tutorials and each of the working groups are described in a chapter of this report. Like other Dagstuhl Seminar reports, these chapters aim at makign the scientific results re-usable and extendable by others. In addition, we also want to help others profit from our experiences with the videoconferencing and other media technologies that we employed and the interaction-design choices that we made. This last chapter is a reflection also on ethical aspects of the precluded and the newly added forms of mobility of scientists (and others) in meetings during and after COVID-19. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Chiara Renso, Vania Bogorny, Konstantinos Tserpes, Stan Matwin, and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fernandes de Macedo.

            "title": "Integrating Process-Oriented and Event-Based Systems",
            "data": "\n <h3>Background and Motivation</h3> \n <p>Process-oriented information systems are software systems that execute and \nmanage a process, broadly defined as a coordinated execution of actions to \nachieve a certain goal. As such, they support Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives. Process-oriented systems have been traditionally used in domains \nsuch as business process automation, enterprise application integration, and \ncollaborative work. Recently, there has also been a significant uptake of \nprocess-oriented information systems in transportation, logistics, and medical \ninfrastructures -- domains that impose new challenges in terms of system \nreactivity and adaptability. Here, trends such as sensing of data (e.g., based \non RFID technology) and advancing system integration (driven by technical \nstandards such as EPCglobal) represent opportunities to strengthen the \nevent-perspective in process-oriented systems in order to achieve more flexible \nand comprehensive process control. \n</p> \n <p>\nEvent-based systems, in turn, have been put forward to integrate \nheterogeneous systems in a flexible and scalable manner by separating \ncommunication from application logic. These systems provide interaction models, \nmechanisms for routing events between components, and techniques for the \ndetection of composite events, i.e., for Complex Event Processing (CEP). Although event-based systems are typically positioned as general-purpose technology, they have found their way into many applications where event generation is comparatively deterministic and follows structured behaviour. In domains such as transportation, logistics, and the medical sector, events handled by event-based systems stem from the execution of processes, which are partially supported by process-oriented information systems. Exploiting the process-perspective, therefore, promises to lead to advancements in the design, analysis, and optimisation of event-based systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe increasing overlap of application scenarios that involve concepts and \ntechniques of process-oriented as well as event-based systems, however, is only \nmarginally supported by exchange and convergence of the related research \nfields. Strong communities have been established for research on either type of \nsystem. Yet, due to the missing link between these communities, manifold \nopportunities for ground-breaking research and broad impact in industry are \nmissed out. Research efforts related to the underlying theory as well as \nspecific platforms are duplicated and similar approaches are developed in \nboth communities. \n</p> \n <p>\nBreaking this disconnect had been the goal that the seminar aimed to achieve by identifying the links between conceptual models, formal analysis methods, and engineering techniques developed for either type of system.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Structure</h3> \n <p>Given that seminar attendees came from two rather disconnected communities, \nthe first day of the seminar featured four tutorials to establish a joint \nunderstanding of essential concepts and terminology. First, Alessandro Margara \npresented an overview of the basic techniques to manage streams of events. \nMathias Weske then gave a primer on BPM, elaborating on the main concepts, models, and the role of events for process management. An advanced view on techniques for event processing was given by Alejandro Buchmann. Stefanie Rinderle-Ma closed this part of the seminar with a tutorial on management, utilisation, and analysis of instance data in distributed process management.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe remainder of the seminar week was centred on break-out sessions, in which \nparticipants worked on particular topics on the intersection of \nprocess-oriented and event-based systems. In these working groups, participants \ndiscussed the relevant state-of-the-art and identified the research challenges \nunder a near-, mid-, or long-term perspective. In addition, there were two \nsessions in which seminar participants gave a very short overview of their \nrecent research work.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics and Key Challenges</h3> \n <p>The working groups focussed on a diverse set of topics, highlighting the key \nchallenges that need to be addressed:\n</p> \n <p><b>Event Models for BPM: Semantics of Events and Patterns.</b> Starting from the observation that event models are well-established in both \nBPM and CEP and that their coupling has obvious benefits, the \nchallenge relates to the question of how events can guide the evolution or \nadaptation of process instances.\n</p> \n <p><b>Towards Automatic Event-Based Monitoring of Processes.</b> Event-based monitoring of processes is influenced by the availability of \npatterns, the consequences of monitoring results, and the integration of \ncontextual information. These dimensions render it particularly challenging to \ncomprehensively discover and utilise patterns for process monitoring.\n</p> \n <p><b>Patterns and Models for Communication.</b> The communication models \nunderlying an event-based middleware have diverse implications for the \ninterplay of processes and event patterns -- and a major challenge is the \nidentification of requirements that are imposed by process scenarios on \ncommunication models.\n</p> \n <p><b>Choreographies and Inter-Process Correlation.</b> Common languages for the description of interacting processes lack capabilities for the specification of event-based processing. The challenge is to develop a better grounding of choreography languages and enable analysis of the information flow between processes.\n</p> \n <p><b>Abstraction Levels: Processes versus Events.</b> Observing that \nmethods in BPM mainly proceed top-down, whereas event processing is often \napproached bottom-up, a key challenge is the identification of the right \nabstraction level on which concepts and methods shall be integrated.\n</p> \n <p><b>Context in Events and Processes.</b> The context of a process may \ninfluence event processing, and the context as materialised in complex events \nimpacts the execution of a process. Yet, a suitable representation and dynamic \nevolution of context information is an open research challenge.\n</p> \n <p><b>Integrated Platforms for BPM &amp; CEP.</b> The integration of traditional BPM or CEP engines promises accelerated application development and lower maintenance cost. To attain this end, the challenge of developing a unified model for events and processes, enabling well-grounded architectural decisions, needs to be addressed.\n</p> \n <p><b>(Highly) Distributed Processes &amp; The Role of Events.</b>\nEvents and processes can both be handled in a centralised or distributed \ninfrastructure and open challenges relate to the tradeoffs regarding trustworthiness, reliability, and scalability.\n</p> \n <p><b>Event Data Quality.</b> Event data may be uncertain, which needs to be reflected in processes that are influenced by these events. The challenge is how to capture such uncertainty  and make explicit how it influences decision making on the level of the process.\n</p> \n <p><b>From Event Streams to Process Models and Back.</b> Event patterns and processes are typically concerned with events on different levels of abstractions, which can be bridged only on the basis of a unifying formal model. Further challenges arise from the imprecision of event definitions in processes and the expressiveness of CEP languages when capturing procedural behaviour.\n</p> \n <p><b>Compliance, Audit, Privacy and Security.</b>Compliance checking of business processes may benefit from CEP systems and BPM tools may be useful to express service level agreements in event-based systems. Challenges, however, are methods for a structured integration  of BPM and CEP technology and their alignment with informal compliance requirements. \n</p> \n <h3>Main Recommendations</h3> \n <p>From the discussions and the exchange of ideas during the workshop, a set of \nrecommendations was able to be distilled in order to materialise the benefits of \nintegrating process-oriented and event-based systems.\n</p> \n <p><b>Build a community around BPM and CEP.</b> The topics on the \nintersection of process-oriented and event-based systems provide a rich field \nfor high-impact research. The number and diversity of open research questions \ncall for a long-term research initiative, so that a respective community needs \nto be built up. To achieve this, it is recommended that joint \nworkshops be initiated at the flagship conferences in either field, the BPM conference and the DEBS conference, and to evaluate potential co-location of the conferences in future.\n</p> \n <p><b>Start research on integrated models.</b> For many of the aforementioned challenges, the lack of integrated models, in which processes and events are first-class citizens, turns out to be a major issue. Research shall be devoted to creating such models, clarifying which basic notions of events exist, and considering the semantics of distributed event generation.\n</p> \n <p><b>Facilitate joint research.</b> Joint research is currently hindered not only by the disconnect of the research communities, but also by a lack of a common set of standard concepts in either community. There is a need for concise overviews of\nthe most important concepts and methods in either field, e.g., by means\nof standard textbooks. Researchers from one field need to be able to\nquickly gather the level of understanding of the other field that is\nrequired for joint research initiatives.\n</p> \n <p><b>Engage industry.</b>The integration of process-oriented and event-based systems is driven by particular domains, such as logistics, health, and mobility. The prioritisation of challenges and the evaluation of developed solutions \ncritically depends on the involvement of industrial partners from these \ndomains. As such, it is recommended to reach out to industry to develop \nevaluation scenarios and benchmark datasets. One viable means for this are the \nresearch proposals on the EU and national levels that involve BPM and CEP \nexperts from both academia and industry. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    David Eyers, Avigdor Gal, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, and Matthias Weidlich\n                </div> \n",

On account of\neither, the until quite recently obscure discipline is increasingly turning\ninto a central area of computer science. Dagstuhl seminar 16481 on <em>\"New\nDirections for Learning with Kernels and Gaussian Processes\"</em> attempted to\nallow a key community within machine learning to gather its bearings at this\ncrucial moment in time.\n</p> \n <p>\nPositive definite kernels are a concept that dominated machine learning\nresearch in the first decade of the millennium.

In their probabilistic interpretation as Gaussian\nprocess models, they are also a fundamental concept of Bayesian inference:\n</p> \n <p>\nA <em>positive definite kernel k</em>: X times X to Re on some input domain X is a function with the property that, for all finite sets {x_1,...,x_N} subset X, the matrix K in Re^{NxN}, with elements k_{ij}=k(x_i,x_j), is positive semidefinite. According to a theorem by Mercer, given certain regularity assumptions, such kernels can be expressed as a potentially <em>infinite</em> expansion <br/>\nk(x,x') = sum_{i=1} ^infty lambda_i phi_i(x) phi_i ^* (x'), qquad with qquad sum_{i=1} ^{infty} lambda_i &lt; infty,<br/>\n</p> \n <p>\nwhere * is the conjugate transpose, lambda_i in Re_+ is a non-negative\n<em>eigenvalue</em> and phi_i is an <em>eigenfunction</em> with respect to some measure u(x): a function satisfying\n</p> \nint k(x,x') phi_i(x) du(x) = lambda_i phi_i(x'). <br/> \n <p>\nRandom functions f(x) drawn by independently sampling Gaussian weights for each eigenfunction, \n</p> \nf(x) = sum_{j=1} ^infty f_j phi_j(x) qquad where qquad f_j sim N(0,lambda_i),\n <p>\nare draws from the centered <em>Gaussian process</em> (GP) p(f)=GP(f;0,k)\nwith <em>covariance function</em> k. The logarithm of this Gaussian process\nmeasure is, up to constants and some technicalities, the square of the norm\n|f |^2 _k associated with the <em>reproducing kernel Hilbert space</em>\n(RKHS) of functions reproduced by k.\n</p> \n <p>\nSupervised machine learning methods that <em>infer</em> an unknown function f\nfrom a data set of input-output pairs (X,Y):={(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1,dots,N} can\nbe constructed by minimizing an empirical risk ell(f(X);Y) regularized by\n|cdot|^2 _k. Or, algorithmically equivalent but with different\nphilosophical interpretation, by computing the <em>posterior</em> Gaussian\nprocess measure arising from conditioning GP(f;0,k) on the observed data\npoints under a likelihood proportional to the exponential of the empirical\nrisk.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe prominence of kernel/GP models was founded on this conceptually and\nalgorithmically compact yet statistically powerful description of inference\nand learning of nonlinear functions. In the past years, however, hierarchical\n('deep') parametric models have bounced back and delivered a series of\nimpressive empirical successes. In areas like speech recognition and image\nclassification, deep networks now far surpass the predictive performance\npreviously achieved with nonparametric models. One central goal of the seminar\nwas to discuss how the superior adaptability of deep models can be transferred\nto the kernel framework while retaining at least some analytical clarity.\nAmong the central lessons from the 'deep resurgence' identified by the seminar\nparticipants is that the kernel community has been too reliant on theoretical\nnotions of universality. Instead, representations must be learned on a more\ngeneral level than previously accepted. This process is often associated with\nan 'engineering' approach to machine learning, in contrast to the supposedly\nmore 'scientific' air surrounding kernel methods. But its importance must not\nbe dismissed. At the same time, participants also pointed out that deep\nlearning is often misrepresented, in particular in popular expositions, as an\nalmost magic kind of process; when in reality the concept is closely related\nto kernel methods, and can be understood to some degree through this\nconnection: Deep models provide a hierarchical parametrization of the feature\nfunctions phi_i(x) in terms of a finite-dimensional family. The continued\nrelevance of the established theory for kernel/GP models hinges on how much of\nthe power of deep models can be understood from within the RKHS view, and how\nmuch new concepts are required to understand the expressivity of a deep\nlearning machine.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere is also unconditionally good news: In a separate but related\ndevelopment, kernels have had their own renaissance lately, in the young areas\nof probabilistic programming ('computing of probability measures') and\nprobabilistic numerics ('probabilistic descriptions of computing'). In both\nareas, kernels and Gaussian processes have been used as a descriptive\nlanguage. And, similar to the situation in general machine learning, only a\nhandful of comparably simple kernels have so far been used. The central\nquestion here, too, is thus how kernels can be designed for challenging, in\nparticular high-dimensional regression problems. In contrast to the wider\nsituation in ML, though, kernel design here should take place at compile-time,\nand be a structured algebraic process mapping source code describing a\ngraphical model into a kernel. This gives rise to new fundamental questions\nfor the theoretical computer science of machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nA third thread running through the seminar concerned the internal conceptual\nschism between the probabilistic (Gaussian process) view and the statistical\nlearning theoretical (RKHS) view on the model class. Although the algorithms\nand algebraic ides used on both sides overlap <em>almost</em> to the point of\nequivalence, their philosophical interpretations, and thus also the required\ntheoretical properties, differ strongly. Participants for the seminar were\ndeliberately invited from both \"denominations\" in roughly equal number.\nSeveral informal discussions in the evenings, and in particular a lively\nbreak-out discussion on Thursday helped clear up the mathematical connections\n(while also airing key conceptual points of contention from either side).\nThursday's group is planning to write a publication based on the results of\nthe discussion; this would be a highly valuable concrete contribution arising\nfrom the seminar, that may help drawing this community closer together.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite the challenges to some of the long-standing paradigms of this\ncommunity, the seminar was infused with an air of excitement. The participants\nseemed to share the sensation that machine learning is still only just\nbeginning to show its full potential. The mathematical concepts and insights\nthat have emerged from the study of kernel/GP models may have to evolve and be\nadapted to recent developments, but their fundamental nature means they are\nquite likely to stay relevant for the understanding of current and future\nmodel classes.  Far from going out of fashion, mathematical analysis of the\nstatistical and numerical properties of machine learning model classes seems\nslated for a revival in coming years. And much of it will be leveraging the\nnotions discussed at the seminar. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Arthur Gretton, Philipp Hennig, Carl Edward Rasmussen, and Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Beyond VR and AR: Reimagining Experience Sharing and Skill Transfer Towards an Internet of Abilities",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSharing experiences and knowledge have always been essential for human development. They enable skill transfers and empathy. Over history, mankind developed from oral traditions to cultures of writing. With the ongoing digital revolution, the hurdles to share knowledge and experiences vanish. Already today it is, for example, technically feasible to take and store 24/7 video recordings of one's life. While this example creates massive collections of data, it makes it even more challenging to share experiences and knowledge with others in meaningful ways. Facilitating the third wave of VR and AR technologies we are  currently witnessing, researchers started to broadly look at VR and AR again. Topics ranging from using AR to mitigate skills gaps [1] and understanding user interaction with commercial AR games [4], to using focus depth as an input modality for VR [2], and understanding the effect of gender in VR [3]. The goal of the seminar was to take a step back from the technical research to look at the fundamental aspects of interactive media.\n</p> \n <p>\t\t \nA recurring theme in science fiction literature is the act of downloading another human's abilities to one's mind. Although current cognitive science and neuroscience strongly suggest that this is impossible, as our minds are embodied; we believe that skill transfer and effective learning will accelerate tremendously given recent technological trends; just to name a few of the enabling technologies, human augmentation using virtual/augmented reality, new sensing modalities (e.g. affective computing) and actuation (e.g. haptics), advances in immersive storytelling (increasing empathy, immersion, communication)  etc. \n</p> \n <p>\nUltimately, we believe this will lead to \"downloadable\" experiences and abilities. The effects will definitely not be instant and it will most likely be very different from the Sci-Fi theme. Yet, these differences are exactly what we want to explore in this seminar. Computer scientists in wearable computing, ubiquitous computing, human computer interaction, affective computing, virtual reality and augmented reality have been working on related topics and enabling technologies for years. However, these developments are disjointed from each other. With this seminar we want to bring them together working in the virtual/augmented/mixed reality, ubiquitous computing, sensing and HCI fields discussing also with experts in cognitive science, psychology and education.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile sharing experiences and knowledge through communication and socializing are a long time focus of various research efforts, we believe it is necessary to rethink and redefine experience sharing and skill transfer in light of the following current technological advances like the following:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Affordable Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality systems will become available to consumers in the near future (or already are available).\n</li><li> Advances in new sense sharing technologies (e.g. eye gaze, haptics, odors).\n</li><li> Advances in real-life tracking of physical and cognitive activities and emotional states.\n</li><li> Educators, cognitive scientists and psychologists have now a better understanding of individual and group behaviors, empathy and fundamentals of learning.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThe seminar was structured around lightning talks by the participants, two hands-on workshops and three thematic sessions. In the lightning talks, the participants introduced themselves and shared their vision with the group. The first hands-on workshop by Shunichi Kasahara introduced the term Superception and showcased prototypes in this domain. The second workshop organized by Pedro Lopes enabled participants to experiment with electrical muscle stimulation by connecting off-the-shelf devices to embedded systems. Three days of the seminar started with thematic sessions run by one of the organizers. The sessions explored the future of human-computer symbiosis, human augmentation, and enabling technologies.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Yamashita, S., Matsuda, A., Hamanishi, N., Suwa, S., &amp; Rekimoto, J.

            "title": "Automated Program Repair",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSoftware engineering targets the creation of software for myriad platforms, \ndeployed over the internet, the cloud, mobile devices and conventional \ndesktops. Software now controls cyber-physical systems, industrial control \nsystems, and \"Internet of Things\" devices, and is directly responsible for \nhumanity's economic well-being and safety in numerous contexts. It is \ntherefore especially important that engineers are able to easily write \nerror-free software, and to quickly find and correct errors that do appear.  \nFuture generation programming environments must not only employ \nsophisticated strategies for localizing software errors, but also strategies \nfor automatically patching them.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent years have seen an explosive growth in research on automated program repair, with proposed techniques ranging from pure stochastic search to pure semantic analysis. The Dagstuhl Seminar in January 2017 studies the problem of automated repair in a holistic fashion. This will involve a review of foundational techniques supporting program repair, perspectives on current challenges and future techniques, and emerging applications. The aim is to broadly discuss and revisit underlying assumptions and methods towards the integration of automated patch synthesis into futuristic programming environments.\n</p> \n <p>\nConceptually, applications of program repair step far beyond the general goal of ensuring software quality, and the subject is relevant to a broad range of research areas. It is of obvious importance in software testing and analysis, because repair goes hand in hand with traditional testing and debugging activities. It is relevant to researchers in programming languages and systems, e.g., to study language and system-level techniques that integrate patch suggestions during development. The topic is relevant to researchers in systems security, as repair approaches may be customizable to patching vulnerabilities in both application and systems software. Researchers in formal methods may provide insight for provably correct repair, given appropriate correctness specifications. Finally, the topic is connected to human computer interaction in software engineering, since the repair process, if not fully automated, may involve eliciting appropriate developer feedback and acting on it accordingly.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt a technical level, one of the key discussion topics has been the \ncorrectness specifications driving the repair process. Most previous work in \nthis domain has relied on test suites as partial correctness specifications.  \nWhile often available, test suites are typically inadequate for fully \nassessing patch correctness. Alternative quality specifications, such as \n\"minimality, could be explored. In addition, heavier-weight \nspecifications, such as assertions, may provide stronger functional \nguarantees, leaving open the research challenge both in how to use them and \nhow they may be derived to guide a repair process. Given the appropriate \ncorrectness specification, the task of repair usually involves three steps: \nlocalizing an error to a small set of potentially-faulty locations, deriving \nvalues/constraints for the computation desired at the faulty locations, and \nconstructing \"fix\" expressions/statements that satisfy these \nvalues/constraints. Each of the three steps can be accomplished by a variety \nof methods, including heuristic search, symbolic analysis and/or constraint \nsolving techniques. This allows for an interesting interplay for an entire \ndesign space of repair techniques involving ingenuous combinations of \nsearch-based techniques and semantic analysis being employed at the \ndifferent steps of the repair process.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar has attracted researchers and practitioners from all \nover the world, comprising participants active in the fields of software \nengineering, programming languages, machine learning, formal methods, and \nsecurity.\nAs a result of the seminar, several participants plan to launch various \nfollow-up activities, such as a program repair competition, which would help \nto further establish and guide this young field of research, and a journal \narticle that summarizes the state of the art in automated program repair.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sunghun Kim and Claire Le Goues and Michael Pradel and Abhik Roychoudhury\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Computer Science Meets Ecology",
            "data": "\n <p>\nEcology is a discipline that shows clearly the potential but also the challenges of computer supported research described as the 4th scientific paradigm by Jim Gray. It is increasingly data driven, yet suffers from hurdles in data collection, quality assurance, provenance, integration, and analysis. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe that ecology could profit from modern computer science methods to overcome these hurdles. \nHowever, usually, scientists in ecology are not completely aware of current trends and new techniques in computer science that can support their daily work. Such support could consist in the management, integration, and (semi-)automatic analysis of resources, like experimental data, images, measurements, in the generation of useful metadata, cloud computing, distributed processing, etc. Ecoinformatics is regarded as an important supporting discipline by many ecologists. However, up to now, very few computer scientists are involved in this discipline; mostly ecoinformatics (or biodiversity informatics) is done by people with a strong background in e.g. ecology and a long (mostly self-taught) experience in data management. It lacks a strong connection to cutting-edge computer science research in order to profit from the results of this area. On the other hand, computer scientists know too little about the domain to be able to offer solutions to relevant problems and to identify potential research avenues.\n</p> \n <p>\nMotivated by our belief that a stronger bond between the disciplines that goes beyond viewing computer science as a \u201cservice provider\u201d is of vital importance, we proposed this Dagstuhl seminar. The aim of the Dagstuhl seminar was to establish such links between (geo-)ecologists, ecoinformaticians and computer scientists.\n</p> \n <h4>The seminar: perspective and self-evaluation</h4> \n <p>\n<b>Before the seminar.</b> It turned out that it was not an easy task to motivate non-computer scientists to attend the seminar. For many, travel costs were a hurdle ultimately preventing attendance. This resulted in an unusually large number of declined invitations (often accompanied by \u201cI would love to attend, but\u2026\u201d emails. \n</p> \n <p>\nDespite these initial problems, we believe that the aim to start building links among the communities was reached at the seminar: We had fruitful discussions in numerous working groups resulting in some very concrete plans for future work. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Organization of the seminar.</b> A total of 27 attendees gathered at the seminar. The wide variety of expertise and backgrounds constituted an initial challenge for the organization. The agenda considered a first round of presentations of the individuals and their research groups with a clear outline and items to treat (personal background, Research Areas/Interests, prospective links to \u201eComputer Science meets Ecology\u201c seminar). After this, the main topics of interest for a wide audience were designed: essentially, three breakout groups were set up in the very first day of the meeting. Over the course of the seminar, these groups were adjusted, split up, or merged, several times. This resulted in quite a number of topics being touched upon with concrete results ranging from a working example for the application of a new method to a modeling problem to concrete plans for publications, a proposal and follow-up activities.  Reports on these groups were given in the plenary session, and can be found in this report. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Broad results of the seminar.</b> Results from the seminar can be categorized in three types: (i) collaborative and networking, as new joint works on specific topics came out of the meeting; (ii) knowledge transfer between fields, as computer scientists learned about the main problems in ecology involving data, while ecologists became aware of what kind of problems data scientists can solve nowadays; and (iii) educational, as several young PhD students and postdocs attended and participated in high level discussions. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Conclusions.</b> The seminar brought together top scientists in the fields of ecology and computer science. The group of individuals was largely interdisciplinary, with a wide range of interests and expertises in each community too: from botany and animal science, to machine learning and computer vision. The seminar was organized in two main types of sessions: plenary and working group sessions to better focus on particular topics. Interesting developments and discussions took place in both, and a high level of cross-fertilization and future collaborations was initiated. On top of this, there was a broad consensus among the participants that the seminar should be the start of a series of yearly or bi-yearly meetings. We hope that the success of this first seminar will encourage broader participation in follow-up activities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gustau Camps-Valls, Joachim Denzler, Thomas Hickler, Birgitta K\u00f6nig-Ries, and Markus Reichstein\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "High-Performance Graph Algorithms",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMany presentations in this Dagstuhl seminar emphasized recent trends regarding typical inputs and their effect on graph algorithm development. From a high-level perspective, one can divide the presentations into two categories: \neither more focused on algorithm theory or more focused on practical algorithmic results. Many talks considered both theoretical and practical aspects. Furthermore, attention was given to intermix talks with theoretical and practically motivated starting points in order to encourage discussions among attendees. We were happy to see such discussions, as well as synergy of both aspects, carrying over to working groups on open problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nTheory-focused talks were given by Sachdeva, Nanongkai, Jacob, Mouatadid, Kyng, Tsourakakis, and Litvak. They considered numerous topics such as Laplacian solvers and related optimization techniques,\ndynamic graph algorithms, external-memory graph algorithms, graph decompositions, and generative models.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe talks with emphasis on practical performance can be further subdivided into three subclasses: (i) graph mining, network analysis and optimization, (ii) parallel, distributed and streaming graph algorithms and (iii) graph generation. The talks given by Koutra, Ahmed, Klymko, Angriman, Gleich and Schulz fall into the first subclass, with a wide variation of algorithmic problems under consideration. Likewise, it was interesting to see the variety in computing platforms and tools (for example shared memory, message passing,\ndistributed systems, streaming from databases, GraphBLAS) used in the eight talks of subclass two, presented by Besta, Shun, Predari, Ramachandran, Pothen, Bader, Finocchi and Davis. Finally, the talks by Phillips, Sanders and Penschuck as well as Crescenzi dealt with generating very large graphs with properties also found in real-world graphs - which is important, among others,\nfor convincing scaling studies in algorithm engineering.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Henning Meyerhenke, Richard Peng, and Ilya Safro\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Data Physicalization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis executive summary gives a brief overview of the goals and agenda for our seminar. \n</p> \n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nAmong the earliest man-made artifacts are physical representations of semantic concepts. These \"physicalizations\" externalize numerical and abstract concepts, providing physical metaphors that allow us to reason, remember, and communicate.   Physicalizations are created for many different purposes, or \"intents.\" The sundial, for example, transforms shadows into a readable representation of time of day, the mercury thermometer transforms temperature into a displacement along a number line, and a scatterplot transforms the values of two variables into a form that allows the reader to interpret correlation. \nOur first data representations were based on natural objects, such as charcoal scraped onto walls or built from clay, or later, ink on paper. With the advent of computers, we've substituted physical representations with pixels on a computer screen. The resurgence of physicalization asks what we have lost in this transformation. Certainly, a computer-based visualization allows us to zoom an image, transform variables in real time, and to zoom through virtual computer-based world.  However, these representations can sever the relationship to the natural world, depriving us of the touch, feel, and emotion that comes from interacting with real objects. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar brought together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners to explore the benefits and challenges of physicalization -- computer scientists trained in visualization, virtual reality and human-computer interaction; architects of virtual and augmented systems; perceptual and cognitive scientists;  and artists and designers. Through interactive discussions and demonstrations, we explored physicalization, as a set of methodologies for representing data, for engaging audiences, and for artistic expression. There were no formal paper presentations.  Instead, the work was done through interactive discussions, hands-on workshops, and interactive demonstrations outside the lecture hall. Figure 1 shows two examples of data physicalizations exhibited by our participants.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3909/20181031_104907.jpg\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3910/DataBells.JPG\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <h3>The Week at a Glance</h3> \n <p>\n<b>Monday.</b> After explaining various organization matters and formalities, the first day began with the physical construction of custom name badges. The hands-on session offered the first occasion to get to know each other, also by comparing the name badges themselves, then and during the whole duration of the seminar. After this session, each of the 40 participants gave a two-minute presentation of their achievements and interests in the field of physicalization. Some described their artistic creations based on data, some showed how mapping data onto physical dimensions enhanced data analysis. Others showed how scientists and artists collaborated to explain biological and physical principles through physicalization, or how principles of perception and cognition could be used to guide how data are effectively mapped onto visual dimensions. The electricity in the air was palpable; everyone realized that we were on the threshold of a new discipline. This energy drove the first deliverable for this seminar: Dagstuhl monograph, and perhaps a book, highlighting extended versions of these 40 contributions.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3911/d_IMG_4307.JPG\" style=\"transform: rotate(180deg);\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3912/d_IMG_4311.JPG\" style=\"transform: rotate(180deg);\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3913/d_IMG_4322.JPG\" style=\"transform: rotate(180deg);\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3914/d_IMG_4323.JPG\" style=\"transform: rotate(180deg);\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <p>\nTo allow a more focused approach towards yet unexplored research topics, the first activity focused on defining \"pillars\" of physicalization, crystallizing the learning and background of the different intellectual communities identified in our proposal. In break-out sessions, each group ideated around and then synthesized the most fundamental papers, examples, principles and challenges for their pillar, relative to physicalization. The  Perception and Cognition Group focused on sensory processing, especially touch perception and embodied cognition, which deals with the way we learn about the world through our motor interactions with it. The Evaluation group shared their experiences in measuring human responses, and how methods might be extended to physicalization. The Design group explored artistic and design approaches to data physicalization. The Applications group identified existing and future application areas. The technology group surveyed the range of materials and devices for physicalization. In the reports-back, the group was encouraged to explore challenges and limitations for each of these core areas, to set the stage for the cross-disciplinary discussions beginning on Tuesday.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Tuesday.</b> At the start the second day, each participant generated three questions for each of the five pillar areas. A massive exercise was undertaken wherein all these questions were organized and grouped into emergent categories. Spontaneous discussions started around the meaning and validity of the themes that emerged, as these would align the next round of thematic discussions (Figure 2). The \"Design Patterns\" group focused on identifying general templates for characterizing data physicalization. The \"Emotion\" group explored unique affordances that touching data enable.  The Vis vs. Phys Group delved into the ways vision and touch were different, and what unique advantages that might enable. The \"Critical\" group explored the range of ethical and critical matters that could be related to physicalization practice in particular. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Wednesday.</b>  Wednesday morning was devoted to hands-on workshops where practitioners engaged small groups in interactive activities.  Samuel Huron's group explored a set of physicalization examples, to identify common principles;  Daniel Keefe demonstrated a virtual reality exploration of the human heart; Till Nagel, Laura Perovich, and Dietmar Offenhuber led a group into the forest to collect natural objects which they used to create physicalizations; Robert Friska provided  surprising problem solving examples that drove a discussion about physical reasoning; Barbara Tversky showed examples of how physical gestures we make contribute to problem solving;  Daniel Schneider led a workshop on computational embroidery, where the data are represented in yarn color and texture.  By the time we piled into the bus for Trier, the large and diverse group of 40 had transformed into a dynamic community of scholars.  Listening into the conversations, you could hear artists explaining how sculpture is taught in Art School, perceptual psychologists describing touch perception; and engineers revealing expertise on control systems for autonomous micro-robots.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Thursday.</b> Thursday was the major work day.  Building on the explorations of Tuesday, we divided into groups and worked on a variety of topics.  One group, for example, focused on how to teach visualization and how to use data physicalization to teach other areas.  Another group worked on a white paper on emotion and physicalization. Another worked on ideas for using physicalization for environmentally-situated projects. Another group focused on categorizing the critical considerations that emerged on Tuesday. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Friday.</b> The final day aimed into transforming the  progress of the past days into concrete contributions.  For example, plans for a physicalization contest were discussed, ideas for the book of 40 contributions were pushed further, as well as on a special issue on physicalization for the Journal of Perceptual Imaging. Another group discussed the topic of scientific funding, among which the experience of past H2020 research proposals, and the potential of future research proposal initiatives that relate to physicalization.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3915/TableOutside1.jpg\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3916/TableOutside2.jpg\" width=\"40%\"/> \n <h3>Hands-on Demonstrations</h3> \n <p>The area outside the main conference room was populated with demonstrations provided by the participants. For example, Andrew Vande Moere brought a wireless, networked display that allowed participants to vote about particular topics that were shown; Volker Schweinsfurth, Daniel Schneider, and many others brought along and exhibited 3-D printed, hand-crafted, or even embroidered physicalizations. Bernice Rogowitz ran participants through several experiments around the topics of touch perception and touch/vision interactions. Section 4 details several of the hands-on experiences seminar participants and organizers could engage in; while Figure 3 shows the diversity of the physical artifacts that participants exhibited.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                    Jason Alexander, Petra Isenberg, Yvonne Jansen, Bernice E.

            "title": "Scalable Set Visualizations",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSets are a fundamental way of organizing information. Visualizing set-based data is crucial in gaining understanding of it as the human perceptual system is an analytic system of enormous power. The number of different set visualization methods has increased rapidly in recent years, and they vary widely in the visual metaphors used and set-related tasks that they support. Large volume set-based data can now be found in diverse application areas such as social networks, biosciences and security analysis. At present, set visualization methods lack the facility to provide analysts with the visual tools needed to successfully interpret large-scale set data as the scalability of existing metaphors and methods is limited. This seminar provided a forum for set visualization researchers and application users to discuss how this challenge could be addressed. \n</p> \n <p>\nExisting set visualizations can be grouped into several families of techniques, including traditional Euler and Venn diagrams, but also node-link diagrams, map- and overlay-based representations, or matrix-based visualizations.\nInevitably, the approaches taken to drawing these visualizations are diverse, for example node-link diagrams require graph drawing methods, whereas overlay techniques use algorithms from computational geometry. However, they are similar in a number of aspects. One aspect is the underlying set theory. For instance, theoretical results into the drawability of many of these set visualization techniques for different data characteristics is possible (as already done in example Venn and Euler diagram research). \nAnother common aspect is that the visualizations are typically focused on an end-user, so perceptual, cognitive and evaluation considerations are an important concern.\n</p> \n <p>\nA particularly pressing issue in set visualization is that of scaling representations. The number of data items can be large and many methods aggregate individual items. Yet, even using aggregation, the limit of the most scalable of these methods is considered to be in the region of 100 sets [1]. Typical application areas that make use of sets include, e.g., social networks, biosciences and security analysis. In these applications, there may be many millions of data items in thousands of sets. Other applications have high-dimensional data, where each item is associated with a large number of variables, which poses different scalability challenges for set visualizations.\n</p> \n <p>\nA distinct feature of set visualization is that visualizations must support set-related, element-related, and attribute-related analysis tasks [1] that involve, e.g., visually evaluating containment relations, cardinalities, unions, intersections, or set differences. For example, bioscience microarray experiments classify large numbers of genes and multiple visualization tools have been developed to visualize this data. However, current efforts can only visualize small sections of the information at once [2]. \nSimilar scalability challenges for set visualizations appear in many other applications as well.\nHence, developing effective visualization methods for large set-based data would greatly facilitate analysis of such data in a number of important application areas. \n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Goals</h3> \n <p>The goal of this seminar was to bring together researchers with different backgrounds but a shared interest in set visualization. It involved computer scientists with expertise, e.g., in visualization, algorithms, and human-computer interaction, but also users of set visualizations from domains outside computer science. Despite the large number of set visualization techniques, for which there is often a considerable practical and theoretical understanding of their capabilities, there has only been limited success in scaling these methods. Thus the intended focus of this seminar was to discuss and study specific research challenges for scalable set visualizations concerning fundamental theory, algorithms, evaluation, applications, and users. We started with a few overview talks on the state of the art in set visualization, but then focused on small hands-on working groups during most of the seminar week. We aimed to accelerate the efforts to improve scalability of set visualizations by addressing open questions proposed by the seminar attendees, in order to produce concrete research outcomes, including new set visualization software and peer-reviewed research publications.\n</p> <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <ol>\n<li> On the first two days of the seminar we enjoyed five invited overview lectures on different aspects of set visualizations. The topics and speakers were chosen as to create a joint understanding of the state of the art of set visualization techniques, evaluations and applications. Silvia Miksch gave a systematic overview of set visualization techniques, grouped by types of visual representations and tasks, with a special focus on set visual analytics. Martin Krzywinski reported about his experiences on using visual analogies for showing set-based data in the area of genomics. Sara Fabrikant took a cartographer's view on visualizing sets and explained how successful cartographic maps work as information displays by taking not only the design but also the context and the user into account. Stephen Kobourov explained how large graph-based set data can be represented using a familiar map metaphor by showing several interesting data sets and their map representations. Finally, John Howse presented how set visualizations can be used as diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic.\n</li><li> In the open problem session on the first day of the seminar we collected a list of 13 open research problems that were contributed by the seminar participants. In a preference voting we determined the five topics that raised the most interest among the participants and formed small working groups around them. During the following days the groups worked by themselves, except for a few plenary reporting sessions, formalizing and solving their respective theoretical and practical challenges. Below is a list of the working group topics; more detailed group reports are found in Section 4.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Mapifying the genome:</b> Can the axis of the entire genome be mapped on a 2-dimensional space based on gene function rather than a 1-dimensional line based on gene position?\n</li><li><b>Area-proportional Euler diagrams with ellipses:</b> Can the use of ellipses extend the size of data that can be drawn with area-proportional Euler diagrams?\n</li><li><b>Spatially informative set visualizations:</b> Can we improve spatial overlay-based set visualizations when allowing some limited displacement of the given set positions?\n</li><li><b>Set visualization using the metro map metaphor:</b> How and under which conditions can the metro map metaphor be used to visualize set systems? \n</li><li><b>Visual analytics of sets/set-typed data and time: challenges and opportunities:</b> What are the main research challenges and opportunities in the context of set visualizations that change over time and how can these be structured?\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>We had a flexible working schedule with a short plenary session every morning to accommodate group reports and impromptu presentations by participants. In two of those Wouter Meulemans and Nan Cao shared recent results of theirs related to set visualization.\n</li><li> During the week we encouraged participants to come up with suggestions for further strengthening this growing community of set visualization researchers. In a plenary session on Friday we collected and structured these ideas and made started planning future events related to set visualizations, see Section 1.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Future Plans</h3> \n <p>During the entire seminar, participants actively discussed ways how to disseminate, proliferate and promote scalable set visualization research in diverse specific areas, such as: set theory and diagrammatic reasoning; algorithms and graph theory; information visualization and visual analytics; evaluation, users and application areas. This led to the concretization of the following future milestones, each of which is being coordinated by volunteered seminar participants:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Diagrams Workshop in 2018</b> on Set Visualization and Reasoning (SetVR)<br/>The workshop aims at promoting set visualization to the Diagrams community, of which well-renowned mathematicians and logicians are members, thus proliferating relevant set theory and diagrammatic reasoning research;\n</li><li><b>IEEE VIS Workshop in 2019</b> on Set Visualization and Analytics (SetVA)<br/>The workshop aims at promoting set visualization to the Information Visuaization and Visual Analytics communities, at the premier forum for advances in information and scientific visualization, with the aim to generate new visualization and analytic techniques to handle large set-typed data;\n</li><li><b>Dagstuhl seminar in 2019</b> on Set Visualization and Analytics (SetVA) over Time and Space<br/>This seminar has revealed, for the first time, the need for visualization and analytic techniques for the set-typed data that has an element of time and/or space; thus a follow-up Dagstuhl seminar will be organized to discuss this topic, once again among researchers with diverse set visualization backgrounds;\n</li><li><b>Set Visualization Workshop in 2020</b> in the Computational Geometry Week or collocated with Graph Drawing<br/>This workshop aims at disseminating set visualization to a more algorithmic and computational geometry research community, to ensure the production of effective, yet efficient and scalable set visualization algorithms;\n</li><li><b>Set Visualization browser</b>, like <a href=\"http://setviz.net\">http://setviz.net</a><br/> This browser will collect and disseminate available set visualization techniques, making them easily accessible through various categorizations, such as the type of data analysis tasks or application areas they target;\n</li><li><b>Set Visualization book</b> <br/>The book would serve as a guide for researchers who are new to set visualization and as a review of the current state-of-the-art of set-typed data in the various related domains.\n</li></ul> \n <p>We decided to have an annual set visualization workshop that each year focuses on one of (i) diagrammatic reasoning and logic, (ii) information visualization and visual analytics, and (iii) computational geometry and graph drawing, at premier venues of the respective research communities, to generate further research interest in all of these three diverse areas that are all important for scalable set visualizations.\n</p> \n <h3>Evaluation</h3> \n <p>According to the Dagstuhl survey conducted after the seminar, as well as informal feedback to the organizers, the seminar was highly appreciated. Particularly the small group size, group composition, and the seminar structure focusing on hands-on working groups was very well received. The seminar's goals to identify and initiate collaboration on new research challenges was very successful (also in comparison to other Dagstuhl seminars) as the participants rated the seminar highly for inspiring new research directions, joint projects and joint publications. We are looking forward to seeing the first scientific outcomes of the seminar in the near future and to continuing the efforts to support the growth of the set visualization community.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>Schloss Dagstuhl was the perfect place for hosting a seminar like this. The unique scientific atmosphere and the historic building provided not only all the room we needed for our program and the working groups, but also plenty of opportunities for continued discussions and socializing outside the official program. On behalf of all participants the organizers want to express their deep gratitude to the entire Dagstuhl staff for their outstanding support and service accompanying this seminar. We further thank Tamara Mchedlidze for helping us collecting the contributions and preparing this report.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Peter Rodgers.

            "title": "Dynamic Traffic Models in Transportation Science",
            "data": "\n <p>Traffic assignment models are crucial for transport planners to be able to predict the traffic distributions - and thereby the congestion, environmental and social impacts - of transport policies, for example in the light of possible changes to the infrastructure (e.g. traffic light controls), to the transport services offered (e.g. the provision of public transport fleets and frequencies), or to the prices imposed on\ntravellers (e.g. road tolls, public transport fares). The prevailing approaches used in the transportation science literature to predict such distributions can be roughly classified into mathematical approaches based on \n<em>dynamic traffic assignment models</em> (DTA) (using the methodology of flows over time) and <em>simulation-based approaches</em> (using large-scale microsimulations). The striking advantage of microscopic simulations over DTA models is that the latter usually ignore practically relevant side-constraints such as horizontal queueing of vehicles, the feedback of changing network conditions on user behavior, flexible departure time choice, mode choice, activity schedule choice, and such. Current simulation tools integrate all these dimensions and many more. The increase in model complexity inherent in simulations, however, is not matched by the existing DTA theory. For most simulation software, there is no \"mathematical proof of concept\" such as formal proofs for the following fundamental properties:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> a (dynamic) equilibrium always exists,\n<li> an equilibrium is unique,\n<li> an equilibrium is efficiently computable,\n<li> there is a smooth function of equilibria with respect to parameters (such as street capacities, tolls, etc.)\n</li></li></li></li></ul> \n <p>\nIn this seminar we brought together, for the third time, leading researchers from three different communities (Simulations, Dynamic Traffic Assignment and Algorithmic Game Theory) in order to bridge the gap between complex simulation based models and the existing theory. In doing so, we build on the progress made in the first two seminars, and at the same time addressed the emerging real-life challenge of modeling the new kinds of \"mobility service\" that are increasingly envisaged for the future, such as intelligent/dynamic ride-sharing and car-sharing, through to fully autonomous vehicles, provided potentially by a variety of competing operators.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this third seminar was to build on the momentum, collaborations and new directions identified at the previous two seminars, following on from the impacts identified earlier. Similarly to the first two seminars, one objective was to make new advances on identifying, formulating and solving existing open problems by combining insights from the different academic fields. Thus, we continued working on themes, initiated at the previous Dagstuhl seminars, related to the representation of queuing in dynamic models and the identification of new requirements and new open problems arising from future forms of mobility and travellers' behaviour, for example, systems of autonomous vehicles, and coordinated/shared routing.\n</p> \n <p>\nAgain, the seminar was a big success. Beside forster collaboration of the last seminars of this series, the seminar stimulates new and very fruitful ones. We got laudatory feedback from many participants which is also reflected in the survey conducted by Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Gairing, Carolina Osorio, Britta Peis, and David Watling\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Uncertainty Quantification and High Performance Computing",
            "data": "\n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p><b>Uncertainty quantification (UQ)</b> aims at approximating measures for the impact of uncertainties in e.g. simulation parameters or simulation domains. By this way, it is of great importance for both academic research and industrial development. In uncertainty quantification, one distinguishes between classical forward uncertainty propagation and more involved inference, optimization or control problems under uncertainties. Forward uncertainty propagation is concerned with deterministic numerical models for e.g. engineering problems, in which parts of the input data (domain, parameters, ...) might be affected by uncertainties, i.e. they have a random nature. Randomness is usually characterized by random fields that replace the originally deterministic inputs. In Bayesian inference, parameters of a system shall be derived for given measurements. Since the measurements are assumed to be affected by some (stochastic) error, this inference approach tries to derive probabilities under which a given parameter leads to the observed measurements. In some sense, Bayesian inference complements classical inverse problems in a stochastic sense. Other fields of interest for a similar uncertainty analysis are optimization and control.\n</p> \n <p><b>High performance computing (HPC)</b> is an interdisciplinary research field in computer science, mathematics and engineering. Its aim is to develop hardware, algorithmic approaches and software to solve (usually) mathematically formulated problems on large clusters of interconnected computers. The dominant part of the involved research is done in parallel computing. From a hardware perspective, HPC or parallel computing requires to develop computing technologies that can e.g. solve several problems at the same time at high performance and low power. Moreover, hardware developments in HPC often aim at improving network communication technologies, which are necessary to let a (potentially) large set of computers solve a single problem in a distributed way. From an algorithmic perspective, methods known from numerical mathematics and data processing are adapted such that they can run in a distributed way on different computers. Here, a key notion is (parallel) scalability which describes the ability to improve the performance or throughput of a given method by increasing the number of used computers. Most algorithmic developments shall improve this scalability for numerical methods. Research in software aims at defining appropriate programming models for parallel algorithms, providing efficient management layers for the underlying hardware and implementing the proposed parallel algorithms in real software.\n</p> \n <h3>Challenges</h3> \n <p>In UQ, (partial) differential equations with random data are approximately solved by either intrusive or non-intrusive methods. An intrusive technique simultaneously discretizes stochastic and physical space with the classical example of stochastic Galerkin approaches. This method delivers favorable properties such as small errors with fewer number of equations and potentially small overall run-time. To achieve that, it requires to re-discretize and re-implement existing deterministic PDE solvers. On the other hand, non-intrusive techniques (e.g.(quasi-)Monte Carlo, multi-level Monte Carlo, stochastic collocation, ...) reuse existing solvers / simulation tools and generate a series of deterministic solutions which are used to approximate stochastic moments. It is thereby possible to perform uncertainty quantification analysis even for very complex large-scale applications for which a re-implementation of existing solvers is no option. The non-intrusive approach is connected to a rather extreme computational effort, with at least hundreds, thousands or even more deterministic problems that have to be solved. While a single real-world forward uncertainty propagation problem is already extremely computational intensive, even on a larger parallel computer, inference, optimization and control under uncertainties often go beyond the limits of currently available parallel computers.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn HPC, we have to distinguish methods that are intrinsically (often also called embarrassingly) parallel and those that have to exchange data to compute a result. That is, embarrassingly parallel algorithms are able to independently compute on completely decoupled parts of a given problem. A prominent example in UQ are Monte-Carlo-type methods. The other extreme are approaches that require to exchange a lot of data in order to solve a given problem. Here, prominent examples are adaptive and multi-level methods in general and stochastic Galerkin methods. Both method types tend to have excellent approximation properties, but require a considerable effort in parallel algorithms to be scalable on parallel computers. Scalability considerations might become even more important on the next generation of the largest parallel computers, which are expected to be available at the beginning of the next decade. These parallel Exascale computers will be able to process on the exaFLOP level, thus they will be able to issue 10 18 floating-point instructions within a second. Technological limitations in chip production will force computing centers to install systems with a parallel processor count which is by orders of magnitude higher than in current systems. Current parallel algorithms might not be prepared for this next step.\n</p> \n <p>The Dagstuhl Seminar on \"Uncertainty Quantification and High Performance Computing\", brought together experts from UQ and HPC to discuss some of the following challenging questions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How can real-world forward uncertainty problems or even inference, control and optimization\nunder uncertainties be made tractable by high performance computing?\n</li><li> What types of numerical uncertainty quantification approaches are able to scale on current\nor future parallel computers, without sticking to pure Monte Carlo methods?\n</li><li> Might adaptivity, model reduction or similar techniques improve existing uncertainty quantification approaches, without breaking their parallel performance?\n</li><li> Can we efficiently use Exascale computing for large-scale uncertainty quantification problems\nwithout being affected by performance, scalability and resilience problems?\n</li><li> Does current research in uncertainty quantification fit the needs of industrial users? Would industrial users be willing and able to use HPC systems to solve uncertainty quantification problems?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Seminar outcome</h3> \n <p>Several presentations covered Bayesion inference / inversion (Ghattas, Marzouk, Najm, Peters), where seismology is an extremely computationally expensive problem that can only be solved by the largest parallel computers (Ghattas). While the parallelization is crucial, the numerical methods have to be adapted as well, such that fast convergence is achieved (Ghattas, Marzouk, Peters). The very computationally intensive optimization under uncertainties (Benner) becomes tractable by the use of tensor approximation methods (Benner, Osedelets). Tensor approximation methods as well as hierarchical matrices (B\u00f6rm, Zaspel) are optimal complexity numerical methods for a series of applications in UQ. However their large-scale parallelization is still subject to research.\n</p> \n <p>\nA series of talks considered mesh-free approximation methods (Rieger, Teckentrup, Zaspel) with examples in Gaussian process regression (Teckentrup) and kernel-based methods. It was possible to see that these methods have provable error bounds (Rieger, Teckentrup) and can be scaled on parallel computers (Rieger, Zaspel). Moreover these methods even fit well for inference (Teckentrup). Sparse grid techniques were considered as example for classical approximation methods for higher-dimensional problems (Stoyanov, Peters, Harbrecht, Pfl\u00fcger). Here, recent developments in adaptivity and optimal convergence were discussed. Sparse grid techniques are usually considered in a non-intrusive setting such that parallel scalability is often guaranteed. Compressed sensing promises to reduce the amount of simulations in a non-intrusive framework (Dexter). Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are under investigation for optimal convergence (Nuyens). The latter methods are of high interest for excellent parallel scalability on parallel computers due to the full decoupling of all deterministic PDE solves while keeping convergence orders beyond classical Monte Carlo methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdaptivity leads to strongly improved approximations using the same amount of deterministic PDE solutions (Pfl\u00fcger, Stoyanov, Webster, ...). However, a clear statement on how to parallelize adaptive schemes in an efficient way is still subject to research. The general class of multi-level schemes was also under investigation (Dodwell, Zhang), including but not being limited to multi-level Monte-Carlo and multi-level reduced basis approaches. These methods show excellent convergence properties. However their efficient and scalable parallelization is part of intensive studies, as well.\n</p> \n <p>\nPerformance considerations in the field of HPC (including future parallel computers) have been discussed (Heuveline, Legrand). Performance predictability is necessary to understand scaling behavior of parallel codes on future machines (Legrand). Parallel scalability of (elliptic) stochastic PDEs by domain decomposition has been discussed by LeMa\u00eetre. His approach allows to increase parallel scalability and might show hints towards resilience.\n</p> \n <p>\nIndustrial applications were considered for the company Bosch (Schick), where intrusive and non-intrusive approaches are under investigation. High performance computing is still subject to discussion in this industrial context. One of the key applications, which is expected to become an industrial-like application, is UQ in medical engineering (Heuveline). Once introduced into the daily work cycle at hospitals, it will soon become a driving technology for our health. \n</p> \n <h3>Perspectives</h3> \n <p>Based on the survey and personal feedback from the invitees, the general consensus is that there is a high interest in deepening the discussions at the border of UQ and HPC. While some answers to the above questions could be given, there is still a lot more to learn, to discuss and to develop. A general wish is therefore to have similar meetings in the future.\n</p> \n <h3>Aknowledgement</h3> \n <p>The organizers would like to express their gratitude to all participants of the Seminar. Special thanks go to the Schloss Dagstuhl team for its extremely friendly support during the preparation phase and for the warm welcome at Schloss Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Vincent Heuveline and Michael Schick and Clayton Webster and Peter Zaspel\n                </div> \n",

Behavioural types include session types, typestate, choreographies, and behavioural contracts. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in research activity, including theoretical foundations, design and implementation of programming languages and tools, studies of the relationships between different forms of behavioural types, and studies of the relationships between behavioural types and more general type-theoretic ideas such as gradual typing and dependent typing. The aim of this seminar was to bring together researchers on behavioural types and related topics, in order to understand and advance the state of the art.\n</p> \n <p>\nMany of the participants have been active in COST Action IC1201: Behavioural Types for Reliable Large-Scale Software Systems (BETTY), a European research network on behavioural types. Other participants were invited from related research areas and from outside Europe, in order to broaden the scope of the seminar and to make connections between communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe programme for the first half of the week was planned in advance, with priority given to two kinds of presentation: (1) demonstrations of programming language implementations and tools, and (2) presentations by participants from outside the BETTY community. The programme for the second half of the week evolved during the seminar, with more emphasis on group discussion sessions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was judged to be a success by all the participants. At least one conference submission resulted from collaboration started during the week, other existing collaborations made substantial progress, and several participants planned a submission to the EU RISE funding scheme.

In addition, the use of these devices makes huge amount of data available, which can improve decisions in real-time control and in disruption management as well as in the planning stage.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this seminar, researchers from algorithm engineering and operations research\nworked together with researchers with an engineering background and participants from practice.\nThe common goal was to improve methods for planning and scheduling of public transportation.\n</p> \n <p>Among others, some specific topic which were covered were</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Scheduling</em> of public transport.

            "title": "Next Generation Domain Specific Conceptual Modeling: Principles and Methods",
            "data": "\n <p>\nModels are the basic human tools for managing complexity and understanding and therefore play a key role in all scientific and engineering disciplines as well as in everyday life. Many modeling paradigms have evolved over time into a wide variety of modeling languages, methods and tools that have come and gone. This is particularly true for Informatics, which is a modeling discipline in itself.\n</p> \n <p>\nSince the 1970s, special attention has been paid to conceptual modeling. This approach essentially uses a formal language whose concepts are linked to a semantic interpretation (e.g. by the grounding in an ontology) and a more or less transparent graphic or textual representation (which supports efficient linguistic perception). Normally, such a language is embedded in a model/meta model hierarchy. The dimensions of conceptual modeling languages are structure, dynamics (behavior) and functionality.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite all efforts, however, there is still no comprehensive and consistent use of conceptual modeling in practice. Often conceptual models are only used as prescriptive documents, which - e.g. in the area of software development or business process management - are rarely synchronized with the developed artifact, so that reality and model diverge step by step. This observation motivated us to promote and conduct this seminar by focusing on domain-specific conceptual modeling, as this promises a methodology that is more tailored to the needs of each user group.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn view of the highly committed discussions during the seminar, the intensive discussions in the working groups and the very positive results of the participant survey, we can say without exaggeration that the seminar was a complete success. Almost all participants wished for a continuation, which we will probably apply for in 2021, when the already decided projects (cooperation and publications of subgroups) are on their way.\n</p> \n <p>\nSince, with one exception, every participant wanted to present their ideas in a talk, the programme was tightly packed: 36 talks and 2 full evening sessions in working groups, the results of which were reported on the next morning, made the seminar week a very intensive but also highly inspiring experience.\n</p> \n <p>First results are already tangible: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The workshop \"Conceptual Modeling for Multi-Agent Problem Solving\" at the IJCAJ 2019 in Macao: The idea was born during the seminar and implemented afterwards: <a href=\"http://austria.omilab.org/psm/content/cmmaps19/info\">http://austria.omilab.org/psm/content/cmmaps19/info</a>. \n</li><li>\tA working group is currently writing a summary paper on the results of the working groups on which agreement was reached in the plenary discussions.\n</li><li>\tQuestions that were discussed during the seminar will be included in contributions to the Summer School \"Next Generation Enterprise Modelling in the Digital Transformation\" in Vienna (July 15-26, Vienna). \n</li><li>The seminar organizers are currently writing a somewhat more popular scientific column to be submitted to CACM. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nA number of open questions and ``grand challenges'' that also could be topics of future relevant conferences have been identified, among others:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Social Aspects of Conceptual Modeling\n</li><li>\tExplanatory Models for Neural Networks and Big Data\n</li><li>\tConceptual Modeling for validation purposes in simulation\n</li><li>\tModeling of Ultra Large Scale Architectures\n</li><li>\tPrivacy Modeling\n</li><li>\tModeling of Behavior Goals for Assistive Systems and Emotions \n</li><li>\tBetter integration into teaching at universities of applied sciences and universities\n</li><li>\tTools and Technical Infrastructures for Conceptual Modeling, in particular for \"multi-metamodeling frameworks\"\n</li><li>\tInvolvement of researchers and practitioners from other fields: \"go beyond the obvious\".\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe biggest challenge for a follow-up seminar will be to encourage more practitioners to participate. For this purpose, we will propose to dedicate two consecutive seminar days to this and the discussion with them, as practitioners usually cannot spend more time.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Heinrich C.

            "title": "Theory of Randomized Optimization Heuristics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nEfficient optimization techniques affect our personal, industrial, and academic environments through the supply of well-designed processes that enable a best-possible use of our limited resources. Despite significant research efforts, most real-world problems remain too complex to admit exact analytical or computational solutions. Therefore, heuristic approaches that trade the accuracy of a solution for a simple algorithmic structure, fast running times, or an otherwise efficient use of computational resources are required. Randomized optimization heuristics form a highly successful and thus frequently applied class of such problem solvers. Among the best-known representatives of this class are stochastic local search methods, Monte Carlo techniques, genetic and evolutionary algorithms, and swarm intelligence techniques.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe theory of randomized optimization heuristics strives to set heuristic approaches on firm ground by providing a sound mathematical foundation for this important class of algorithms. Key challenges in this research area comprise optimization under uncertainty, parameter selection (most randomized optimization heuristics are parametrized), the role and usefulness of so-called <em>crossover</em> operations (i.e., the idea of creating high-quality solution candidates by recombining previously evaluated ones) and, more generally, performance guarantees for advanced heuristics such as population-based techniques, estimation-of-distribution algorithms, differential evolution, and others.\n</p> \n <p>\nDagstuhl Seminar 19431 on \"Theory of Randomized Optimization Heuristics\" was a continuation of the seminar series originally on \"Theory of Evolutionary Algorithms\". Today the field extends far beyond evolutionary algorithms -- a development that previous Dagstuhl seminars have significantly influenced. \n</p> \n <p>\nWhile the previous seminar 17191 had a very strong focus on methodological questions and techniques needed to analyze stochastic optimization heuristics, the present seminar had among its three main focus topics chosen to foster interaction with two strongly linked research communities that were not previously represented in the seminar series: stochastic control theory and empirical benchmarking of randomized optimization heuristics.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent work has shown that there is a very close link between the theory of randomized optimization heuristics and stochastic control theory, both regarding the nature of the \"systems\" of interest and the analytical techniques that have been developed in the two communities. At the seminar, we have explored these affinities through the two invited presentations of Luc Pronzato and Vivek Borkar, through contributed talks highlighting different aspects studied in both communities (e.g., the presentation on one-shot optimization by Olivier Teytaud), and through focussed breakout sessions, in particular the one fully dedicated to <em>Connection  between the analysis of evolution strategies and estimation of distribution algorithms and the analysis of stochastic approximation and ordinary differential equations</em>, in which interesting similarities and differences between the two fields were identified. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe second focus topic of Dagstuhl Seminar 19431 was benchmarking of optimization heuristics. Benchmarking plays a central role in empirical performance assessment. However, it can also be an essential tool for theoreticians to develop their mathematically-derived ideas into practical algorithms, thereby encouraging a principled discussion between empirically-driven and theoretically-driven researchers. Benchmarking has been a central topic in several breakout sessions, for example those on <em>Competitions and Benchmarking, Algorithm Selection and Configuration</em>, but also the breakout session on <em>Multi-Objective Optimization</em>. A survey of best practices in empirical benchmarking has been kick-started in the breakout session on <em>Benchmarking: Best Practices and Open Issues</em>. \n\n</p> <p>Discussing the mathematical challenges arising in the performance analysis of randomized heuristics has always been a central topic in this Dagstuhl seminar series. Among other achievements, important connections between continuous and discrete optimization have been established, most notably in the form of drift theorems, which are typically applicable regardless of the nature of the search space. Apart from such methodological advances, we have also observed two other trends bridging discrete and continuous optimization: (i) an increased interest in analyzing parameter-dependent performance guarantees, and (ii) the recent advances in the study of estimation of distribution algorithms, which borrow techniques from both discrete and continuous optimization theory. These topics have been discussed in the invited talk of Youhei Akimoto, in several contributed presentations, and in the breakout sessions on <em>Measuring  Optimization Progress in an Invariant Way for Comparison-Based Algorithms</em> and on <em>Mixed-Integer Optimization</em>.    \n</p> \n <p>\nApart from these focus topics, we have discussed a large number of different aspects related to the theoretical analysis of optimization heuristics, including brainstorming sessions on doing \"good\" research, organizing a repository to share lecture materials, and discussing the role of uncertainty in heuristic optimization, the connections between experimental design and one-shot optimization, the importance of neutral representations, and differences between stochastic gradient descent methods and evolution strategies, to give but a few examples.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization</h3> \n <p>The seminar hosted the following type of events:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Five invited talks of 30 minutes each: \n<ul>\n<li> Youhei Akimoto on <em>Expected Runtime Bound for the (1+1)-Evolution Strategy</em>\n</li><li> Vivek  Borkar on <em>Overview of Stochastic Approximation and Related Schemes</em>\n</li><li>Pietro S. Oliveto on <em>What is Hot in Evolutionary Computation (Part~2)</em>\n</li><li> Luc Pronzato on <em>Dynamical Search</em>\n</li><li> Carsten Witt on <em>What is Hot in Evolutionary Computation (Part~1)</em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>20 contributed talks of around 15-20 minutes \n</li><li> Four \"flash talks\" of about 10 minutes \n</li><li> Eleven parallel breakout sessions in various different formats, ranging from brainstorming on the purpose and future of theory research through actual problem solving on one-shot optimization to kick-starting a survey on best practices on benchmarking optimization heuristics. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAll presentations were plenary, i.e., in a single session, while the breakouts were organized in parallel working groups, to allow for focused and specialized discussions. As in previous years, the breakout sessions were very well perceived, and can be considered a well-established format of this seminar series. As a result of these discussions, we are planning a workshop and a survey on benchmarking best practices. Several open problems have been proposed and discussed at the seminar, and we are confident that the seminar has helped to establish new collaborations.  \n</p> \n <p>\nOur traditional hike on Wednesday was a good opportunity to discuss in a less formal setting and to get to know each other. On Thursday evening, we had the special opportunity to hear Jonathan Rowe present activities of the Alain Turing Institute <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/\">https://www.turing.ac.uk/</a>, where he serves as Programme Director for Data Science for Science. Last, but not least, the wine-and-cheese party complemented the scientific activities with a relaxed social event.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe would like to thank the Dagstuhl team and all participants for making seminar 19431 a great success and a great pleasure to organize.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Carola Doerr, Carlos M.

            "title": "Deep Learning and Knowledge Integration for Music Audio Analysis",
            "data": "\n <p>This executive summary gives an overview of our discussions on the integration of musical knowledge in deep learning approaches while summarizing the main topics covered in this seminar. We also describe the seminar's group composition, the overall organization, and the seminar's activities. Finally, we reflect on the most important aspects of this seminar and conclude with future implications and acknowledgments.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview</h3> \n <p>Music is a ubiquitous and vital part of our lives. Thanks to the proliferation of digital music services, we have access to music nearly anytime and anywhere, and we interact with music in a variety of ways, both as listeners and active participants. As a result, music has become one of the most popular categories of multimedia content. In general terms, music processing research aims to contribute concepts, models, and algorithms that extend our capabilities of accessing, analyzing, understanding, and creating music. In particular, the development of computational tools that allow users to find, organize, analyze, generate, and interact with music has become central to the research field known as Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Given the complexity and diversity of music, research has to account for various aspects such as the genre, instrumentation, musical form, melodic and harmonic properties, dynamics, tempo, rhythm, timbre, and so on.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs in general multimedia processing, many of the recent advances in MIR have been driven by techniques based on deep learning (DL). For example, DL-based techniques have led to significant improvements for numerous MIR tasks including music source separation, music transcription, chord recognition,\nmelody extraction, beat tracking, tempo estimation, and lyrics alignment.\nIn particular, major improvements could be achieved for specific music scenarios where sufficient training data is available. A particular strength of DL-based approaches is their capability to extract complex features directly from raw audio data, which can then be used for making predictions based on hidden structures and relations. Furthermore, powerful software packages allow for easily designing, implementing, and experimenting with machine learning models based on deep neural networks (DNNs). \n</p> \n <p>However, DL-based approaches also come at a cost, being a data-hungry and computing-intensive technology. Furthermore, the design of suitable network architectures (including the adaption of hyper-parameters and optimization strategies) can be cumbersome and time-consuming -- a process that is commonly seen more as an art rather than a science. Finally, the behavior of DL-based systems is often hard to understand; the trained models may capture information that is not directly related to the core problem. \nThese general properties of DL-based approaches can also be observed when analyzing and processing music, which spans an enormous range of forms and styles -- not to speak of the many ways music may be generated and represented. While one aims in music analysis and classification problems at capturing musically relevant aspects related to melody, harmony, rhythm, or instrumentation, data-driven approaches often capture confounding factors that may not directly relate to the target concept (e.g., recording conditions in music classification or loudness in singing voice detection).\n</p> \n <p>\nOne main advantage of classical knowledge-based engineering approaches is that they result in explainable and explicit models that can be adjusted intuitively. On the downside, such hand-engineered approaches not only require profound signal processing skills as well as domain knowledge, but also may result in highly specialized solutions that cannot be directly transferred to other problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs mentioned earlier, one strong advantage of deep learning is its ability to learn, rather than hand-design, features as part of a model. Nowadays, it seems that attaining state-of-the-art solutions via machine learning depends more on the availability of large quantities of data rather than the sophistication of the approach itself.\nIn this seminar, we critically questioned this statement in the context of concrete music analysis and processing applications. In particular, we explored existing approaches and new directions for combining recent deep learning approaches with classical model-based strategies by integrating knowledge at various stages in the processing pipeline.\n</p> \n <p>There are various ways how one may integrate prior knowledge in DL-based MIR systems.\nFirst, one may exploit knowledge already at the input level by using data representations to\nbetter isolate information known to be relevant to a task and remove information known to\nbe irrelevant (e.g., by performing vocal source separation before transcribing lyrics). Next,\none may incorporate musical knowledge via the model architecture in order to force the\nmodel to use its capacity to characterize a particular aspect (e.g., limited receptive fields\nto prevent a model from \"seeing\" too much or introducing constraints that mimic DSP\nsystems). Furthermore, the hidden representations can be conditioned to provide humans\nwith \u201cmusically sensible control knobs\u201d of the model (e.g., transforming an embedding space\nto separate out different musical instruments). Knowledge can also be exploited in the\ndesign of the output representation (e.g., structured output spaces for chord recognition that\naccount for bass, root, and chroma) or the loss function used for optimization. During the\ndata generation and training process, one may use musically informed data augmentations\ntechniques to enforce certain invariances (e.g., applying pitch shifting to become invariant to\nmusical modulations). Exploiting musical knowledge by combining deep learning techniques\nwith ideas from classical model-based approaches was a core topic of this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>The success of deep learning approaches for learning hidden structures and relations very much depends on the availability of (suitably annotated and structured) data. Therefore, as one fundamental topic, we discussed aspects of generating, collecting, accessing, representing, annotating, preprocessing, and structuring music-related data. These issues are by far not trivial. First of all, music offers a wide range of data types and formats, including text, symbolic data, audio, image, and video. For example, music can be represented as printed sheet music (image domain), encoded as MIDI or MusicXML files (symbolic domain), and played back as audio recordings (acoustic domain). Then, depending on the MIR task, one may need to deal with various types of annotations, including lyrics, chords, guitar tabs, tapping (beat, measure) positions, album covers, as well as a variety of user-generated tags and other types of metadata. To algorithmically exploit the wealth of these various types of information, one requires methods for linking semantically related data sources (e.g., songs and lyrics, sheet music and recorded performances, lead sheet and guitar tabs). Temporal alignment approaches are particularly important to obtain labels for automatic music transcription and analysis tasks. As for data accessibility, copyright issues are the main obstacle for distributing and using music collections in academic research. The generation of freely accessible music (including music composition, performance, and production) requires considerable effort, experience, time, and cost. \n</p> \n <p>\nBesides the quantity of raw music data and its availability, another crucial issue is the input representation used as the front-end of deep neural networks. For example, log-frequency or Mel spectrograms are often used as input representations when dealing with music signals. We discussed recent research efforts where one tries to directly start with the raw waveform-based audio signal rather than relying on hand-engineered audio representations that exploit domain knowledge. In this context, we discussed how one might resolve phase shift issues by using carefully designed neural network architectures. Further recent research directions include the design of network layers to mimic common front-end transforms or incorporate differentiable filter design methods into a neural network pipeline. \n</p> \n <p>\nAnother central topic we discussed during our seminar was how to exploit musical structures via <em>self-supervised</em> and <em>semi-supervised learning</em>. Instead of relying on large amounts of labeled data, this technique exploits known variants and invariants of a dataset, using lots of <em>unlabeled</em> data. For example, without knowing the transcription of a musical piece, we know how the transcription would change if we shift the whole audio signal by some number of semitones. As another example, we can learn a notion of audio similarity by exploiting the fact that samples from a single musical audio signal are more similar than two samples drawn from different musical audio signals. We also discussed using multi-modal data to give implicit labels, such as text, image, video, and audio correspondences. On the semi-supervised learning side, representations learned in a self-supervised way can be fine-tuned to a particular task with a small amount of labeled data. In this vein, we discussed model generalization, model adaptability, active learning, few-shot learning, and human-in-the-loop systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, we addressed topics related to the evaluation of MIR systems. In particular, we discussed the gap between loss functions typically used for optimizing deep learning pipelines and evaluation metrics designed for evaluating specific MIR tasks. In this context, we pointed out the vulnerability of standard metrics to slight variances irrelevant to the perceived output quality, expressing the need for more reliable evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we envisioned the possibility of closing the gap by designing more meaningful loss functions that may be used in the context of end-to-end learning systems. \n</p> \n <h3>Participants and Group Composition</h3> \n <p>In our seminar, we had 22 participants, who came from various locations around the world, including North America (2 participants from the United States), Asia (2 participants from South Korea), and Europe (18 participants from France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom). The number of participants and international constellation are remarkable considering the ongoing pandemic. (Note that many of the invited participants, particularly\nfrom overseas, were not allowed to go on business trips.) More than half of the participants (12 out of 22) came to Dagstuhl for the first time and expressed enthusiasm about the open and retreat-like atmosphere. Besides its international character, the seminar was also highly interdisciplinary. While most of the participating researchers are working in music information retrieval, we also had participants with a background in musicology, signal processing, machine learning, mathematics, computer vision, and other fields. Our seminar stimulated cross-disciplinary discussions by having experts working in technical and non-technical disciplines while highlighting opportunities for new collaborations among our attendees. Furthermore, the number of participants from the industry (6 out of 22) was relatively high, which also underlines the relevance of the seminar\u2019s topic beyond fundamental research. Most of the participants had a strong musical background, some of them even having a dual career in an engineering discipline and music. This led to numerous social\nactivities, including playing music together. In addition to geographical locations and research disciplines, we tried to foster variety in terms of seniority levels (e.g., we had three Ph.D. students and six participants on the postdoc/junior/assistant professor level) and in terms of gender (6 out of 22 of the participants identify as female). Besides scientific questions, we\ndiscussed in our seminar also various challenges that younger colleagues typically face when setting up their research groups and scientific curriculum at the beginning of their academic careers.\n</p> \n <h3>Overall Organization and Schedule</h3> \n <p>Dagstuhl Seminars have a high degree of flexibility and interactivity, allowing participants to discuss ideas and raise questions rather than presenting research results. Following this tradition, we fixed the schedule during the seminar asking for spontaneous contributions with future-oriented content, thus avoiding a conference-like atmosphere, where the focus tends to\nbe on past research achievements. After the organizers gave an overview of the Dagstuhl concept, we started the first day with self-introductions, where all participants introduced themselves and expressed their expectations and wishes for the seminar. We then continued with short (15 to 20 minutes) stimulus talks, where specific participants addressed some critical questions related to the seminar\u2019s overall topic in a non-technical fashion. Each of these talks seamlessly moved towards an open discussion among all participants, where the\nrespective presenters took over the role of a moderator. These discussions were well received and often lasted for more than half an hour. The first day closed with a brainstorming session on central topics covering the participants\u2019 interests while shaping the overall schedule and format for the next day. We continued having stimulus tasks interleaved with extensive discussions on the subsequent days. On the second day, we split into smaller groups, each\ngroup discussing a more specific topic in greater depth. The results and conclusions of these parallel group sessions, which lasted between 60 to 90 minutes, were then presented and discussed with the plenum. However, since the overall seminar size of 22 participants was relatively small, it turned out that the division into subgroups was not necessary. Thanks to excellent group dynamics and a fair distribution of speaking time, all participants had\ntheir say and were able to express their thoughts in the plenum while avoiding a monotonous conference-like presentation format. On the last day, we enjoyed a tutorial by Umut Simsekli on some theoretical concepts behind deep learning (a topic unanimously desired by the group). We concluded the seminar with a session we called \u201cself-outroductions\u201d where each participant presented their personal view on the seminar\u2019s results.\n</p> \n <p>While working in technical engineering disciplines, most participants also have a strong background and interest in music. This versatility significantly impacted the seminar\u2019s atmosphere, leading to cross-disciplinary intersections and provoking discussions and resulting in intensive joint music-making during the breaks and in the evenings. One particular highlight was a concert on Thursday evening organized by Cynthia Liem and Christof Wei\u00df, where\nvarious participant-based ensembles performed a wide variety of music, including classical music, Irish folk music, and jazz.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusions and Acknowledgment</h3> \n <p>There is a growing trend toward building more interpretable deep learning systems, from the data collection and generation stage, to the input and output representations, to the model structure itself. On the other hand, classical model-based approaches bring a wealth of expertise on techniques for knowledge integration in system design. \nThe Dagstuhl Seminar gave us the opportunity for connecting experts from classical model-based approaches, deep learning-based approaches, and related interdisciplinary fields such as music perception and human-computer interaction in order to generate discussion and spark new collaborations.\nThe generation of novel, technically oriented scientific contributions was not the main focus of the seminar. Naturally, many of the contributions and discussions were on a conceptual level, laying the foundations for future projects and collaborations. Thus, the main impact of the seminar is likely to take place in the medium and long term. Some more immediate results, such as plans to share research data and software, also arose from the discussions. As further measurable outputs from the seminar, we expect to see several joint papers and applications for funding.\n</p> \n <p>\nBesides the scientific aspect, the social aspect of our seminar was just as important. We had an interdisciplinary, international, and interactive group of researchers, consisting of leaders and future leaders in our field. Many of our participants were visiting Dagstuhl for the first time and enthusiastically praised the open and inspiring setting. The group dynamics were excellent, with many personal exchanges and shared activities. Some scientists expressed their appreciation for having the opportunity for prolonged discussions with researchers from neighboring research fields, which is often impossible during conference-like events.\nAt this point, we would like to let some of the participants have their say: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Stefan Balke (pmOne \u2013 Paderborn, DE): <em>\"Dagstuhl is always a wonderful experience, having time to think, talk, and play music. All in a relaxed atmosphere, the seminar feels like a family meeting \u2013 especially in these times.\"</em>\n</li><li>Alice Cohen-Hadria (IRCAM \u2013 Paris, FR): <em>\u201cNow I feel like a part of a community.\u201d</em>\n</li><li>Dasaem Jeong (Sogang University \u2013 Seoul, KR): <em>\u201cFull of insightful discussions, music, and friends in a beautiful place.\u201d</em>\n</li><li>Cynthia Liem (TU Delft, NL): <em>\u201cDagstuhl is the one place in the world where one effectively can have a week long unconference. More deeply talking about research and new ideas, enjoying time with academic friends, with much less distraction than one would have at home, or even in a \u2018regular\u2019 conference. Especially coming out of a pandemic, I am realizing this is among the most valuable things in our professional life.\u201d</em>\n</li><li>Daniel Stoller (Spotify \u2013 Bonn, DE): <em>\u201cDagstuhl brings perspectives on the big issues.\u201d</em>\n</li><li>Yu Wang (New York University \u2013 Brooklyn, US): <em>\u201cDiscussion is like music: the live version is always better.\u201d</em>\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, our expectations for the seminar were not only met but exceeded, in particular concerning networking and community building. We want to express our gratitude to the Dagstuhl board for giving us the opportunity to organize this seminar, the Dagstuhl office for their exceptional support in the organization process, and the entire Dagstuhl staff for their excellent service during the seminar. In particular, we want to thank Susanne Bach-Bernhard and Michael Gerke for their assistance during the preparation and organization of the seminar.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Rachel Bittner, Meinard M\u00fcller, and Juhan Nam\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>Machine learning of software artefacts is an emerging area of interaction between the machine learning (ML) and software analysis (SA) communities. Increased productivity in software engineering hinges on the creation of new adaptive, scalable tools that can analyse large and continuously changing software systems. For example: agile software development using continuous integration and delivery can require new documentation models, static analyses, proofs and tests of millions of lines of code every 24 hours. These needs are being addressed by new SA techniques based on machine learning, such as learning-based software testing, invariant generation or code synthesis.\n</p> \n <p>\nMachine learning is a powerful paradigm for SA that provides novel approaches to automating the generation of models and other essential artefacts. However, the ML and SA communities are traditionally separate, each with its own agenda. This Dagstuhl Seminar brought together top researchers active in these two fields who can present the state of the art, and suggest new directions and collaborations for future research. We, the organisers, feel strongly that both communities have much to learn from each other, and the seminar  focused strongly on fostering a spirit of collaboration.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe first day was dedicated to mutual education through a series of tutorials by leading researchers in both ML and SA to familiarise everyone with the terminology, research methodologies, and main approach of each community. The second day was dedicated to brainstorming and focused discussion in small groups, each of which supported by one of the organisers acting as a facilitator.  At the end of the day a plenary session was held for each group to share a summary of their discussions.

            "data": "\n <p>\nIn its beginnings, the technical and socio-economical feasibility of Bitcoin was met with much skepticism; however, this has since changed as both research and practice have outlined the merits of distributed ledger technologies, commonly referred to as \"blockchains\". Possible applications of blockchains reach from decentralized settlement layers over complex smart contract systems to tailored authenticated data structures that implement systems for identity or supply chain management. Nevertheless, beyond the immediate opportunities and applications lie many open questions regarding the long-term perspective of both permissionless and permissioned blockchain technologies. For example, while scalability and sustainability are currently topics of active research and development, other aspects such as usability, interoperability and cryptoeconomics have received considerably less attention. In order to anticipate and address future key topics and questions related to blockchain technologies, this seminar strove to provide an interdisciplinary breeding ground.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe participants focused on future applications and developments of this technology and discussed how such complex systems can thrive over a long period of time. Thereby, we started our seminar by outlining and collecting current and potentially future issues from the diverse viewpoints of the participants. These issues include not only current limitations of the underlying technologies, but also problems encountered in real-world applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs an example, we considered the various economic, legal and technological uncertainties and problems that have arisen as a consequence of the recent contentious forks in both the Bitcoin (August 2017) and Ethereum (July 2016) networks. While the possibility of such forks was previously well known, it can be argued that provisionary measures and research on effectively dealing with them was immature and could have been addressed much sooner. In any case, the ramifications of these events have and will continue to influence the discussion and development of blockchain technologies.\n\nBeside establishing the relevant issues through numerous talks, subgroups of participants were formed to discuss a specific set of topics. Over the course of the seminar, participants were encouraged to move between groups and provide input to various topics. We hope to have thus enriched the discussion with different viewpoints and to have facilitated a rewarding range of outcomes; at the point of writing, two papers directly resulting from this Dagstuhl seminar are submitted for review. The goal of the seminar was to develop a shared and open agenda that shapes and directs research and development in the area of distributed ledger technologies to face current and future challenges as well as contribute to the positive development of this field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe talks and working groups of this first Dagstuhl seminar on Blockchains, Smart Contracts and their future applications focused inter alia on the following topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>current and future protocols, including alternative consensus protocols\n</li><li> governance \n</li><li> interdisciplinary aspects of Blockchain technology (economy, law)\n</li><li> cross-chain communication\n</li><li> scalability and costs\n</li><li> Goldfinger and other attack vectors\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Foteini Baldimtsi, Stefan Katzenbeisser, Volkmar Lotz, and Edgar Weippl\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Graph Colouring: from Structure to Algorithms",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Graph Colouring problem is to label the vertices of a graph with the smallest possible number of colours in such a way that no two neighbouring vertices are identically coloured. Graph Colouring has been extensively studied in Computer Science and Mathematics due to its many application areas crossing disciplinary boundaries. Well-known applications of Graph Colouring include map colouring, job or timetable scheduling, register allocation, colliding data or traffic streams, frequency assignment and pattern matching. However, Graph Colouring is known to be computationally hard even if the number of available colours is limited to 3.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe central research aim of our seminar was to increase our understanding of the computational complexity of the Graph Colouring problem and related NP-complete colouring problems, such as Precolouring Extension, List Colouring and $H$-Colouring. The approach followed at the seminar for achieving this aim was to restrict the input of a colouring problem to some special graph class and to determine wether such a restriction could make the problem tractable. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs input restriction, the main focus was to consider hereditary graph classes, which are those classes of graphs that are closed under vertex deletion. Hereditary graph classes provide a unified framework for a large collection of well-known graph classes. The reason for this is that a graph class is hereditary if and only if it can be characterized by a (unique) set H of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. This property enables a <em>systematic</em> study into the computational complexity of a graph problem under input restrictions. For instance, one can first restrict the input to some hereditary graph class for which H is small, say cal H has size 1 or 2, or for which H consists of small graphs only.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn line with the seminar's research aim, the seminar brought together researchers from Discrete Mathematics, working in structural graph theory, and researchers from Theoretical Computer Science, working in algorithmic graph theory. In total, 45 participants participated from 14 different countries. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe scientific program of the seminar consisted of 23 sessions: 4 one-hour survey talks, 17 contributed talks of at most thirty minutes and 2 open problem sessions. This left ample time for discussions and problem solving.\n</p> \n <p>\nEach of the four survey talks covered a particular structural or algorithmic key aspect of the seminar to enable collaborations of researchers with different backgrounds. On Monday, Sophie Sprikl presented a state-of-the-art summary of the Graph Colouring problem for H-free graphs and gave  the main ideas and techniques behind an important, recent result in the area, namely a polynomial-time algorithm for colouring P_6-free graphs with at most four colours. On Tuesday, Marcin Pilipczuk gave a tutorial on the framework of minimal chordal completions and potential maximal cliques. This technique plays a crucial role for solving the Maximum Independent Set problem on some hereditary graph classes, but has a much wider applicability. On Wednesday, Bart Jansen gave a presentation on the parameterized complexity of the Graph Colouring problem and related colouring problems. Due to a large variety of possible parameterizatons, Jansen's talk covered a wide range of open problems. On Thursday, Konrad Dabrowski gave an introduction to the clique-width of hereditary graph classes. If a graph class has bounded clique-width, then Graph Colouring and many other NP-hard problems become polynomial-time solvable. Hence, as a first step in the design of a polynomial-time algorithm, one may first want to verify if the clique-width (or any equivalent width parameter) of the graph class under consideration is bounded. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe two general open problem sessions took place on Monday and Tuesday afternoon. Details of the presented problems can be found in the report, together with abstracts of all the talks.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Maria Chudnovsky, Daniel Paulusma, and Oliver Schaudt\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Computational Proteomics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 19351 'Computational Proteomics' discussed several key challenges of facing the field of computational proteomics. The topics discussed were varied and wide-ranging, and radiated out from the four topics set out at the start.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese four topics were (i) personally identifiable proteomics data; (ii) unique computational challenges in data-independent analysis (DIA) approaches; (iii) computational approaches for cross-linking proteomics; and (iv) the visual design of proteomics data and results, to communicate more clearly to the broad life sciences community. A cross-cutting topic was introduced as well, which focused on proteotyping in clinical trials as it brings many of the previous challenges together, by asking the logical but complex question of how proteomics approaches, data, and associated computational methods and tools can become part of routine clinical trial data acquisition, monitoring and processing.\n</p> \n <p>\nBased on these initial topics, breakout sessions were organized around proteomics data privacy, dealing with data from DIA approaches, how to best utilize computational approaches to use cross-linking for structural elucidation, and the importance of visualisation of proteomics data and results to engender excitement for the field's capabilities in the life sciences in general. However, these breakout sessions in turn inspired additional breakout sessions on associated topics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe DIA and cross-linking breakouts both yielded the issue of ambiguity in identification as a cross-cutting topic that merited its own dedicated breakout session. A closley related breakout session, derived from the proteomics privacy and DIA sessions, centered on open modification searches, which are now becoming feasible in proteomics for the first time, but which are also prone to potentially crippling ambiguity issues while raising even more complex privacy issues. The visual design breakout explicitly identified multi-omics data integration as a direct offshoot of its discussions, which led to a dedicated breakout session on this topic as well. Another emerging breakout session concerned public data, which was triggered by both the DIA and cross-linking topics because of their shared need to disseminate their respective specialised data and results in a standardised, uniform, and well-structured manner. Finally, the cross-linking and DIA topics also led to a breakout session on ion mobility, as this technological advance was seen as a key aspect in the future of these technologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nEach of these breakout sessions had exciting outcomes, and gave rise to future research ideas and collaborations. The proteomics privacy breakout concluded that the field is now ready to delve in more detail into the issues surrounding proteomics data privacy concerns, and that a white paper will be written that can be used to propose policy and to inform the community. The DIA breakout identified three such future tasks: (i) to develop a perspective manuscript that will discuss peptide-centric and spectrum-centric FDR, as well as the effects of shared evidence; (ii) to conduct an experiment for testing DDA versus DIA on the same sample to discover the sampling space for precursors and fragments; and (iii) to conduct a second experiment for understanding target/decoy scoring for different decoy generation models using both synthetic and predicted target/decoy peptides. The cross-linking breakout concluded that a cross-linked ribosomal protein complex should be used as a standardized dataset publicly available to the community, while a 'Minimum Information Requirements About a Cross Linking Experiment (MIRACLE)' was proposed to unify results from many crosslinking tools. The results will also be presented at the Symposium on Structural Proteomics in G\u00f6ttingen in November 2019. The visual design breakout came up with many fine-grained conclusions, but also with an overall design philosophy which centered on three levels of technical detail, depending on the audience: i) interfaces for deatiled data exploration for experienced consumers; ii) interfaces with minimal technical information, focusing on high-level data for the specific scientific question for novice consumers; and iii) interfaces with only relevant information for clinical decision making (e.g. short list of proteins significantly affected by the disease) for clinicians.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe five offshoot breakouts described above also came to conclusions, and the interested reader is referred to the corresponding abstracts for details.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the 2019 Dagstuhl Seminar on Computational Proteomics was extremely successful as a catalyst for careful yet original thinking about key challenegs in the field, and as a means to make progress by setting important, high impact goals to work on in close collaboration. Moreover, during the Seminar, several highly interesting topics for a future Dagstuhl Seminar on Computational Proteomics were proposed, showing that this active and inspired community has not yet run out of challenges, nor out of ideas and opportunities!\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                     Lennart Martens and Nuno Bandeira\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Graph Embeddings: Theory meets Practice",
            "data": "\n <p>\nGraph-structured data is ubiquitous across application domains ranging from chemo- and bioinformatics to image and social network analysis. To develop successful machine learning algorithms or apply standard data analysis tools in these domains, we need techniques that map the rich information inherent in the graph structure to a vectorial representation in a meaningful way-so-called graph embeddings. Designing such embeddings comes with unique challenges. The embedding has to account for the complex structure of (real-world) networks and additional high-dimensional continuous vectors attached to nodes and edges in a (permutation) invariant way while being scalable to massive graphs or sets of graphs. Moreover, when used in supervised machine learning, the model trained with such embeddings must generalize well to new or previously unseen (graph) instances. Hence, more abstractly, designing graph embeddings results in a trade-off between expressivity, scalability, and generalization.\n</p> \n <p>\nStarting from the 1960s in chemoinformatics, different research communities have worked in the area under various guises, often leading to recurring ideas. Moreover, triggered by the resurgence of (deep) neural networks, there is an ongoing trend in the machine learning community to design invariant/equivariant neural architectures that are capable of dealing with graph- and relational input, both (semi-)supervised and unsupervised, often denoted as graph neural networks.\nAlthough successful in practical settings, most of these developments are driven by intuition and empiricism and are geared towards specific application areas. There is no clear understanding of these approaches' limitations and their trade-offs in complexity, expressivity, and generalization. Researchers recently started to leverage connections to graph theory, group theory, logic, combinatorial algorithms, and (algorithmic) learning theory, leading to new theoretical insights and triggering new research in applications. Hence, in this seminar, we aimed to bring together leading applied and theoretical researchers in graph embeddings and adjacent areas, such as graph isomorphism, bio- and chemoinformatics, graph theory, to facilitate an increased exchange of ideas between these communities. Concretely, we aimed to understand what hinders recent theoretical developments being applied in application areas and worked towards a more practical theory. Further, we aimed at understanding the overarching challenges across applications and challenges inherent to specific areas to stimulate directions for further practical and theoretical research. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar bought together 33 researchers from (applied) mathematics, specifically harmonic analysis and (algebraic) topology, (theoretical) computer science, machine learning, bioinformatics, and network science. Eighteen researchers attended remotely owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the participants presented 18 talks on their recent progress in a better understanding of graph embeddings, focusing on supervised machine learning, particularly graph neural networks. Many talks dealt with leveraging tools from graph isomorphism testing and related areas such as finite model theory and group theory. In particular, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, a popular heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, was used to measure the expressivity of the presented algorithms and neural architectures. The consensus was that the above algorithm leads to a too coarse-grained measure of expressivity, and new notions of expressivity are needed to develop a thorough understanding. Surprisingly, only a few talks dealt with developing a better understanding of generalization, indicating that the research community still lacks an understanding. Notably, Gitta Kutyniok showed how to leverage random graph models and graphons to analyze the generalization error of graph neural networks, while Bruno Ribeiro talked about the connection between causality and out-of-distribution generalization. Further, some talks used methods from (algebraic) topology and their connection to graph theory to devise provably expressive architectures and to better understand common problems with graph neural networks, e.g., the problem of ``over-smoothing'' of node representations faced when considering deep architectures. Moreover, two talks covered the challenges of applying graph neural networks to biomedical data and industrial applications at Google, respectively, indicating a gap between theoretical results and practical architectures.\n</p> \n <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> \n <p>The seminar was well received, as witnessed by several positive comments from on-site participants. In general, there was an exciting atmosphere at the seminar, particularly among the large number of junior researchers attending the seminar on-site, also witnessed by many lively discussions during on-site talks. However, this was not always the case during online talks, and the active participation of online participants was relatively low.

            "title": "Secure Compilation",
            "data": "\n <p>\n<b>Secure compilation</b> is an emerging field that puts together advances in security,\nprogramming languages, compilers, systems, verification, and hardware\narchitectures to devise compilation chains that eliminate security\nvulnerabilities, and allow sound reasoning about security properties in the\nsource language. For example, all modern languages define valid control flows,\ne.g., calls must always return to the instruction after the calling point, and\nmany security-critical analyses such as data flow analysis rely on programs\nadhering to these valid control flows. However, today's compilation chains\n(compilers, linkers, loaders, runtime systems, hardware) cannot efficiently\nprevent violations of source-level control flows by co-linked low-level code,\nwhich can call and return to arbitrary instructions or smash the stack,\nblatantly violating the high-level abstraction. Other problems arise because\nlanguages fail to specify security policies, such as data confidentiality, and\nthe compilation chains thus fail to enforce them, especially against powerful\nattacks such as those based on side channels. Yet other problems arise because enforcing\nsource-level abstractions requires runtime checks with noticeable overhead, so\ncompilation chains often forego security properties in favor of efficient code.\nThe emerging field of secure compilation aims to address such problems by:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Identifying precise security goals and attacker models.</b><br/>\nSince there are many interesting security goals and many different kind of\nattacks to defend against, secure compilation is very diverse. Secure\ncompilation chains may focus on providing (some degree of) type and memory\nsafety for unsafe low-level languages like C and C++, or on providing\nmitigations that make exploiting security vulnerabilities more difficult. Other\nsecure compilation chains use compartmentalization to limit the damage of an\nattack to only those components that encounter undefined behavior, or to enforce\nsecure interoperability between code written in a safer language (like Java, C#, ML, Haskell, or Rust) and the malicious or compromised code it links\nagainst. Yet another kind of secure compilation tries to ensure that compilation\nand execution on a real machine does not introduce side-channel attacks.\n</li><li><b>Designing secure languages.</b><br/>\nBetter designed programming languages and new language features can enable secure\ncompilation in various ways. New languages can provide safer semantics, and updates\nto the semantics of old unsafe languages can turn some undefined behaviors into guaranteed\nerrors. Components or modules in the source language can be used as units of\ncompartmentalization in the compilation chain. The source language can also make it\neasier to specify the intended security properties. For instance, explicitly annotating\nsecret data that external observers or other components should not be able to obtain\n(maybe indirectly through side channels) may give the compilation chain the freedom to\nmore efficiently handle any data that it can deduce is not influenced by secrets.\n</li><li><b>Devising efficient enforcement and mitigation mechanisms.</b><br/>\nAn important reason for the insecurity of today's compilation chains is that\nenforcing security can incur prohibitive overhead or significant compatibility\nissues. To overcome these problems, the secure compilation community is\ninvestigating various efficient security enforcement mechanisms such as\nstatically checking low-level code, compiler optimizations, software rewriting\n(e.g. software fault isolation), dynamic monitoring, and randomization. Another\nkey enabler is the emergence of new hardware features that enable efficient\nsecurity enforcement: access checks on pointer dereferencing (e.g. Intel MPX,\nHardbound, WatchdogLite, Oracle SSM, SPARC ADI, or HWASAN), protected enclaves\n(e.g. Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, Sanctum, or Sancus), capability machines\n(e.g. CHERI, Arm Morello), or micro-policy machines (e.g. Draper PUMP, Dover CoreGuard). The\nquestion is how such features can enable various security features in\nsource languages efficiently, i.e., how hardware extensions can provide\nenforcement mechanisms for security properties.\n</li><li><b>Developing effective verification techniques for secure compilation chains</b><br/>\nCriteria for secure compilation are generally harder to prove than compiler\ncorrectness. As an example, showing full abstraction, a common criterion for\nsecure compilation, requires translating any low-level context attacking the\ncompiled code to an equivalent high-level context that can attack the original\nsource code. Another example is preservation of secret independent timing even\nin the presence of side-channels, as required for ``constant-time'' cryptographic\nimplementations, which can require more complex simulation proofs than for compiler\ncorrectness. Finally, scaling such proofs up to even a simple compilation chain\nfor a realistic language is a serious challenge that requires serious proof\nengineering in a proof assistant.\n</li></ol> \n <p><b>The Secure Compilation Dagstuhl Seminar 21481</b> attracted a large\nnumber of excellent researchers with diverse backgrounds. The 42\nparticipants (12 on site, 30 remote) represented the programming languages, formal verification, compilers, security, systems, and hardware communities, which led to many interesting points of view and enriching discussions. Due to COVID-19 pandemic-related travel restrictions and uncertainties, many of the participants had to participate remotely using a combination of video conferencing, instant messaging, and ad-hoc gatherings. Despite this mixed environment, discussions thrived. Some of these conversations were ignited by the 5 plenary discussions and the 28 talks contributed by the participants.\nThe contributed talks spanned a very broad range of topics: formalizing ISA security guarantees, hardware-software contracts, detection and mitigation of (micro-architectural) side-channel attacks, securing trusted execution environments, memory safety, hardware-assisted testing, sampled bug detection,\nformal verification techniques for low-level languages and secure compilation chains, machine-checked proofs, stack safety, integrating hardware-safety guarantees, effective compartmentalization and its enforcement, cross-language attacks, security challenges of software supply chains, capability machines,\n(over-)aggressive compiler optimizations, concurrency, new programming language abstractions, compositional correct/secure compilation, component safety,\ncompositional verification, contextual and secure refinement, hardening WebAssembly, secure interoperability, (not) forking compilers, interrupts,\nhardware design, and many more. Talks were interspersed with lively discussions since, by default, each speaker could only use half of the time for\npresenting and had to use the other half for answering questions and engaging with the audience. Given the high interest spurred by this second edition and the positive feedback received afterwards, we believe that this Dagstuhl Seminar should be repeated in the future, when hopefully all the participants will be able to attend onsite. One important aspect that could still be improved in future editions is spurring more participation from the systems and hardware communities, especially people working at the intersection of these areas and security or formal verification.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    David Chisnall, Deepak Garg, Catalin Hritcu, and Mathias Payer\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Matching Under Preferences: Theory and Practice",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMatching under preferences is a general field spanning computer science, economics, and mathematics. The seminal paper in the field is one by Gale and Shapley (1962) that launched an algorithmic approach to matching agents with preferences. The central problems in the field involve matching agents to each other and to resources in a stable and efficient manner. Matching market algorithms based on the preferences of the agents have several applications such as in school admissions, placement of hospital residents, and centralized\nkidney markets. Topics in the field include two-sided matchings involving agents on both sides (e.g., job markets, school choice, etc.); two-sided matchings involving agents and items (e.g. course allocation, project allocation, assigning papers to reviewers etc.); one-sided matchings (roommates problem, kidney exchanges, etc.); and matching with payments (assignment game, auctions, etc.).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe topic of matching under preferences not only has tremendous applications but is based on a deep mathematical theory that has been developed by multiple research communities including theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, discrete mathematics, game theory, and microeconomics. One of the main purposes of the seminar was to bring together leading researchers from various communities working on the topic and facilitate collaboration. The participant list was a mixture of researchers from computer science, mathematics, and economics. The seminar provided a platform to discuss state of the art in matching under preferences; identify new and exciting applications of developing research; and understand the mathematical and algorithmic requirements of new and upcoming problems in the field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was conducted in a hybrid manner, with 15 participants attending the seminar physically from the Dagstuhl center and 34 participants attending online. The hybrid nature of the work required the need for careful planning to keep participants engaged and to facilitate collaboration between off-site and on-site participants. The online participation was managed via zoom  and gather-town softwares.\n</p> \n <p>The four main focus topics of the workshop were the following ones. \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Matching markets with distributional constraints,\n</li><li> Probabilistic and Fractional Matching,\n</li><li> Matching in online and dynamic settings, and\n</li><li> Matching Markets and machine learning.\n</li></ol> \n <p>All of the four focus areas are important directions for the field. As new applications arise, it is clear that many real-life matching markets have additional feasibility and distributional constraints. Secondly, most of the theoretical developments in the field concern deterministic outcomes, so one of the goals was to make further progress on probabilistic mechanisms. During the seminar, current and new research on probabilistic approaches was discussed. \nThirdly, many practical matching markets have online and dynamic aspects. There were several discussions on how to model and solve online matching problems. Fourthly,  with the increased importance of machine learning in building computer systems, the seminar provided an opportunity to discuss how learning approaches help solve market design problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn each of the first four days, there was a one-hour survey talk given by an expert on the above topics. On the first day, Yash Kanoria presented a survey on \"online matching markets\". On the second day, John Dickerson gave a survey talk  on machine learning and matching markets. On day three, Makoto Yokoo presented an overview of \"matching under constraints.\" On day four, Jay Sethuraman surveyed \"probabilistic matchings.\" \n</p> \n <p>\nOn each of the days there were several shorter scientific presentations. During the workshop, two rump sessions were organized to facilitate different time zones. The rump sessions gave an opportunity to the participants to give brief updates or share open problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the week, there were several time slots dedicated to flexible discussion and collaboration as well as dedicated working groups working on particular research topics. Apart from collaborations in smaller groups, the workshop witnessed major collaboration or discussion around several topics. Robert Bredereck brought up the issue of unifying and streamlining terminology and discussed the issue of using gender-neutral terms. There was a large working group led by Sushmita Gupta and Pallavi Jain that examined computational problems that combine the goals of stability and popularity. There was a group led by Bettina Klaus on lexicographic preferences in matching and market design. Finally, Florian Brandl led a group on the intersection between matching and fair division.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the last day, there was a panel discussion that was moderated by Haris Aziz and Bettina Klaus. The discussants in the panel were P\u00e9ter Bir\u00f3, \u00c1gnes Cseh, Lars Ehlers, Alex Teytelboym, and Utku \u00dcnver. The main topics discussed included ways to build synergies between research communities and having an impact on the practice of matching markets.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers thank all the Dagstuhl staff members for their professional support, the participants for enriching the seminar, Somouaoga Bonkoungou and Alex Lam for providing video conferencing support, and Se\u00e7kin \u00d6zbilen for his support in putting together the abstracts that compose this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Haris Aziz, P\u00e9ter Bir\u00f3, Tam\u00e1s Fleiner, and Bettina Klaus\n                </div> \n",

Some of these methods are based on leveraging experience and methods from electronic design automation (EDA) and from program synthesis and verification.

            "title": "Software Evolution in Time and Space: Unifying Version and Variability Management",
            "data": "\n <h3>Overview and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nModern software systems evolve rapidly and often need to exist in many variants. Consider\nthe Linux kernel with its uncountable number of variants. Each variant addresses\ndifferent requirements, such as runtime environments ranging from Android phones to large\nsuper-computers and server farms. At the same time, the Linux kernel frequently boasts\nnew versions, managed by thousands of developers. Yet, software versions\u2013resulting from\nevolution in time\u2013and variants\u2013resulting from evolution in space\u2013are managed radically\ndifferently. Version management relies on a version control system (Git) and sophisticated\nworkflows\u2013concepts that have been developed for decades in the field of software configuration\nmanagement (SCM) [12, 24, 23]. Variant management in the Linux kernel relies on techniques\nknown from the field of software product line engineering (SPLE) [27, 11, 13], such as an\nintegrated software platform, a variant-aware build system [7], an interactive configurator\ntool [30], and a model-based representation [9, 8, 17, 1] of all kernel features [4, 28]. The Linux\nkernel is exemplary for many large-scale, variant-rich, and rapidly evolving software systems\nin industry [5, 3, 32], especially in the domains of embedded, cyber-physical, automotive,\nand avionics control systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite decades of research in both fields, the effective evolution of variant-rich systems is\nstill an open problem. Three main challenges exist. First, while version control systems are\nwell-integrated into development processes, product-line engineering requires investment into\nadditional tooling and different processes that are difficult to adopt. In fact, organizations\nrarely adopt product line engineering from scratch [6], but rather use readily available\nversion control systems with their branching and forking facilities\u2013a strategy known as\nclone&amp;own [15, 10]. While this strategy is simple, it does not scale with the number of\nvariants, and then requires evolving (i.e., re-engineering) cloned variants into a product-line\nplatform [2]. Second, evolving product-line platforms is substantially more complex than\nevolving single variants, mainly since developers need to work on all variants at the same\ntime [25]. Third, the granularity of tracking versions of variants is still unclear. While\nthe whole platform can be versioned, ideally, versioning at the level of features should be\nsupported.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn summary, SCM and SPLE are two widely established, yet actively researched software\nengineering disciplines offering a variety of concepts to deal with software versions and\nvariants [16, 14, 18, 21]. Yet, despite various attempts [22, 34, 33, 20], none of the two\ndisciplines has been successful in establishing unified solutions addressing both problems at\nthe same time\u2013mainly due to the isolation of both communities and due to the absence of\nrealistic and widely accepted requirements on how to evaluate the effectiveness of techniques\nfor managing both versions and variants.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>This Dagstuhl Seminar aimed at establishing a body of knowledge on unified version and\nvariant management. We invited leading practitioners and researchers from both disciplines\nto discuss each other\u2019s challenges, solutions, and experiences. The seminar\u2019s goals were to:\n(i) survey state-of-the-art SCM and SPLE concepts and map both areas\u2019 terminologies and\nopen problems, (ii) gather industrial and academic challenges and requirements on integrated\nversion and variant management, (iii) survey and assess existing evaluation approaches,\nand (iv) stablish a research agenda, research infrastructure, and working groups. To guide\nfuture research, the participants also discussed the basis to work on improved evaluation\napproaches\u2013as benchmarks for new version and variant management techniques. As such,\nthe long-term goal of the seminar was to enable the development and evaluation of enhanced\nversion and variant management techniques that will be adopted in practice.\n</p> \n <h3>Week Overview</h3> \n <p>\n<b>Monday.</b> After an introduction of all participants, the seminar started off with general\ntalks on versioning and variability. Bernhard Westfechtel set the stage with an introduction\ninto version management concepts and workflows, which already illustrated some overlap\nwith variability management concepts. For instance, directed deltas are conceptually similar\nto compositional variation mechanisms (e.g., feature modules or delta modules), and the\nconstruction of versions in intensional versioning can be related to the configuration-based\nderivation of individual variants from a product-line platform. The seminar continued with\na talk by Don Batory, who discussed the integration of version control systems, variability\nmanagement techniques, and integrated development environments (IDEs) based on ideas\ncentering around a better representation and execution of program refactorings in versioned\nand variant-rich software systems. The talk by Thorsten Berger (actually given on Tuesday,\nsince the introduction round and discussions for the other talks took more time) followed up\non the concepts introduced in the previous talks and presented a survey on variation control\nsystems, which support developers managing variant-rich systems in terms of features. Such\nvariation control systems go back to the end of the 1970s with concepts and prototypes\ndeveloped in the SCM community, but never made it into the mainstream. The talk surveyed\ntheir concepts and discussed problems likely prohibiting their adoption. Thereafter, we\nenjoyed three talks on industrial perspectives given by our industrial practitioners: Henrik\nL\u00f6nn (Volvo), Danilo Beuche (pure::systems), and Ramesh S. (General Motors; talk also\ngiven on Tuesday for timing reasons), confirming and explaining the gaps between academia\nand industry.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Tuesday.</b> The day started with an introduction into the prospective breakout groups for the\nafternoon, followed by the talk of Christoph Seidl on versioning of product lines relying on a\nrepresentation of feature versions in a new dialect of feature models, called Hyper Feature\nModels. Thereafter, the breakout sessions on four relevant topics took place, specifically: on\na conceptual model to map SPLE and SCM concepts, on operations for managing versions\nand variants, on analyses of versions and variants, on workflows for managing versions and\nvariants, and on first-class support of variability and versioning in programming languages. A\nbenchmarking group was discussed, but abandoned in favor of first working on the foundations\nbefore discussing benchmarking techniques to evaluate prospective unified techniques for\nversioning and variability. The breakout group discussions continued until the afternoon, before the remaining talks from Monday were given (Thorsten Berger and Ramesh Sethu),\nfollowed by lightning talks from Shurui Zhou and Sandro Schulze. Shurui discussed the\nrelevance of version and variability management in the domain of engineering AI-based\nsystems, where models and large dataset need to be managed. Sandro proposed a roundtrip-\nengineering process relying on unified management of versioning and variability, relying\non automated extraction of variability information from cloned variants (which should be\nintegrated into a platform in a round-trip-engineering manner).\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Wednesday.</b> We started the day with a talk by Daniel Str\u00fcber on benchmarking scenarios\nand a survey of existing benchmarks. In fact, it is a common consensus of the community\nthat the lack of strong, landmark benchmarks hinders the progress in both communities\n(SCM and SPLE). Thereafter, Yi Li presented his work on slicing of the history of software\ncodebases along features, where features are represented by test cases to help identifying the\nrelevant code in a longitudinal manner. Thomas Th\u00fcm then presented a vision on the\u2013ideally\nautomated\u2013synchronization of cloned variants as followed by the VariantSync research project\nwhich is led by Thomas and Timo Kehrer. Thomas also presented a very first prototypical\nimplementation of the VariantSync tool. The approach shares, based on audience feedback,\nideas with the Virtual Platform, proposed by researchers in 2014 [1]. In the afternoon, the\nmajority of the participants continued their discussion on their group trip to the city of Trier\nand a dinner at a local winery.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Thursday.</b> The day began with a talk by Gabriele Taentzer, presenting a generalizing\nframework for transformations of software product lines, relying on the formalism of category\ntheory. Another talk was given by Julia Rubin on equivalence checking of variants based on\nbehavior instead of structural characteristics of changes. Thereafter, the breakout groups\ncontinued their discussions until the later afternoon, where the results were presented to the\nother seminar participants. After dinner, two lightning talks were given by Paulo Borba\nand Iris Reinhartz-Berger. Paulo discussed the detection of semantic merge conflicts in the\nlight of avoiding unwanted feature interactions, and Iris presented insights from two research\nprojects on behavior-derived variability analysis and mechanisms recommendation.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Friday.</b> The last day of the seminar started with a talk by Lukas Linsbauer on his work\ntowards a feature-oriented and distributed version-control system, relying on the variantintegration\ntooling ECCO. We then had a closing discussion, re-iterating the main challenges\nwe identified throughout the seminar, as well as discussing future work.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcome of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar established breakout groups who continued their discussion after the seminar and\nalready published two papers [7, 1] at the VariVolution workshop, hosted at the Systems and\nSoftware Product Line Conference (SPLC). In addition, a paper accepted at the main track\nof SPLC on benchmarking, relying on input from the seminar participants via a survey [31],\nand providing an initial infrastructure for community-oriented benchmark creation, can be\nseen as a core outcome of the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>A core topic of the final discussion was the teaching of SPLE and SCM concepts\u2013an\nimportant means to eventually improve the handling of versions and variants in practice. One\nof the problems identified is that, while SCM is covered sufficiently, the relevant variability-management concepts are not taught at the Bachelor\u2019s level in the majority of universities.\nHowever, the discussants believe that practicing feature-oriented analysis and design early in\nthe curriculum would be beneficial, where currently object-oriented analysis and design is\ndominating. Interestingly, based on the experience of the discussants, SPLE is still seen as\nsomething rather futuristic by students, which is somewhat surprising, given that building\nhighly configurable systems and software platforms are established practices, so perhaps\nthere is a perception and awareness problem that teaching needs to address. Naturally, a\ncourse teaching SPLE at the Bachelor\u2019s level should also teach the relevant SCM concepts.\nA closely related topic discussed is that of teaching architectures, especially those of product\nlines, which is not really in the focus of current software architecture courses. Of course, it\nis generally difficult to talk to students about software architecture, since, as a discussant\nexplains, a relevant abstract concept that students do not immediately perceive as relevant\nin the course of the studies. In contrast, with compilers and databases, students obtain some\nhands-on experience, which allows them to relate more closely to, especially with respect to\na future job in the industry. This calls for close collaboration with industry in SPLE courses.\n</p> \n <p>\nEstablishing benchmarks turned out to be a more difficult problem than expected. Benchmarking was prominently discussed, as well as input elicited for a set of 11 high-level\nbenchmarking scenarios defined by some of the seminar participants and organizers before\nthe seminar. The participants plan to follow-up on creating concrete benchmarks upon\nthe infrastructure created. One idea is to build a web application to contribute specific\nbenchmark data (e.g., code integration examples, comprising the original code variants\nand the final result as a ground truth) to establish a community benchmark. Another\ninteresting comment was that the currently published case studies and experience reports\nabout variability management and product lines are relatively old and do not provide sufficient\ntechnical details. Furthermore, they also do not highlight the problems associated with\nclone&amp;own and the need for product-line migration techniques adequately. This discussion is\na call to arms for improving the benchmarking situation in the SCM and SPLE community.</p> \n <p>\nLast but not least, an important outcome of the final discussion session of the seminar is the need for a commonly agreed set of core concepts, mechanisms and practices\u2013a welldocumented\nBody of Knowledge (BOK) of our discipline. Currently, only some aspects\nof versioning in time and space are partially covered by the Software Engineering BOK (SWEBOK). However, for promoting a consistent view of our discipline worldwide and\nbeyond our discipline borders as well as for having a foundation for a consistent curriculum\ndevelopment, a dedicated BOK or an extension of the SWEBOK may be necessary as a\ncommunity effort.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Sven Apel, Don Batory, Christian K\u00e4stner, and Gunter Saake.

            "data": "\n <p>\nRandomization plays a prominent role in many subfields of theoretical computer science. Typically, this role is twofold: On the one hand, randomized methods can be used to solve essentially classical problems easier or more efficiently. In many cases, this allows for simpler, faster, and more appealing solutions for problems that have rather elaborate deterministic algorithms; in other cases, randomization provides the only known way to cope with the problem (e.g. polynomial identity testing, or deciding whether there exists a perfect matching with exactly b red edges in an edge-colored bipartite graph). On the other hand, there are also cases where randomness is intrinsic to the question being asked, such as the study of properties of random objects, and the search for algorithms which are efficient on average for various input distributions.\n</p> \n <p>\nParameterized complexity is an approach of handling computational intractability, where the main idea is to analyze the complexity of problems in finer detail by considering additional problem parameters beyond the input size. This area has enjoyed much success in recent years, and has yielded several new algorithmic approaches that help us tackle computationally challenging problems. While randomization already has an important role in parameterized complexity, for instance in techniques such as color-coding or randomized contractions, there is a common opinion within researchers of the field that the full potential of randomization has yet to be fully tapped.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of this seminar was to help bridge this gap, by bringing together experts in the areas of randomized algorithms and parameterized complexity. In doing so, we hope to:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Establish domains for simpler and/or more efficient FPT algorithms via randomization.\n</li><li>Identify problems which intrinsically need randomization.\n</li><li> Study parameterized problems whose instances are generated by some underlying distribution.\n</li><li> Stimulate the development of a broadened role of randomness within parameterized complexity. \n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marek Cygan, Fedor V.

Recent efforts include slicing data plane resources by using network (link) virtualization and applying operating system design principles in Software Defined Networking (SDN).\nDriven by network operators, network management principles are currently\nenvisioned to be even further improved by virtualizing network functions\nwhich are currently realized in dedicated hardware appliances.\nThe resulting Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm abstracts\nnetwork functions from dedicated hardware to virtual machines running on\ncommodity hardware and enables a Cloud-like network management.\nAll of these efforts contribute to a softwarization of communication\nnetworks.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis softwarization represents a significant change to network design\nand management by allowing the application of operating system design\nand software engineering principles to make network management more\nefficient, e.g., by enabling flexible and dynamic service provisioning.\n</p> \n <p>\nSince the NFV efforts are currently mainly driven by carriers and standardization bodies, academic research is decoupled from the industry driven NFV attempts in redesigning network management. Due to this missing link to academic research, opportunities for groundbreaking research and broad impact in academia are currently missing out. This Dagstuhl Seminar thus gathered researchers from academia, industry, and standardization bodies to establish this missing link by fostering collaborations and joint research initiatives.\nThus, a particular focus of the seminar was on identifying the diverse\nconnections between industry driven NFV efforts and current academic\nnetworking research.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together 24 participants in January 2017 to discuss a potential NFV research agenda within 2.5 days. The program included different invited talks that provided an overview on selected aspects of NFV and lightning talks by each participants to provide first research questions and to sketch research directions. We summarize each talk in the remainder of this report. The main focus of the seminar was then the in-depth discussion the\nresearch areas identified in the lightning talks in several breakout\nsessions, which we also summarize. We closed the seminar by collecting and discussing several opinions from each participant: (i) lessons learned and surprises on NFV during the seminar and (ii) open research questions.\nWe further collected controversial statements on NFV research and asked\nthe seminar participants on whether they agree or disagree to each\npresented statement. We summarize the outcomes at the end of the report. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    David Hausheer, Oliver Hohlfeld, Diego R.

            "title": "Extreme Classification",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe topic of this seminar is in the general context of machine learning [10] which concerns the study and development of algorithms that learn from empirical data how to make accurate predictions about yet unseen data without being explicitly programmed. Multi-class and multi-label learning are classical problems in machine learning. The outputs here stem from a finite set of categories (classes), and the aim is to classify each input into one (multi-class) or multiple (multi-label) out of several possible target classes. Classical applications of multi-class and multi-label learning include handwritten optical character recognition [8], part-of-speech tagging [11], and text categorization [7]. However, with the advent of the big data era, learning problems can involve even millions of classes. As examples let us consider\nthe following problems:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Person recognition in Facebook images (there are billions of Facebook users; given an image, we might want to predict the subset of users present in the image for such applications like security, surveillance, social network analysis, etc.).\n</li><li> Predicting Wikipedia tags for new Wikipedia articles or webpages (Wikipedia has almost 2 million tags now).\n</li><li> Recommending Amazon items where each of the 100 million items on Amazon is a separate label.\n</li><li> Search on Google/Bing where each of the 100 million queries is a separate label.\n</li><li> Language modelling \u2013 predicting the next word in a sentence from the millions of words available.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The problems of this type are often referred to as <em>extreme classification</em>. They have posed new computational and statistical challenges and opened a new line of research within machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of extreme classification is to design learning and prediction algorithms, characterized by strong statistical guarantees, that exhibit sublinear time and space complexity in the number of classes. Unfortunately, the theoretical results obtained so far are still not satisfactory and very limited. Moreover, the problems at this scale often suffer from unreliable\nlearning information, e.g., there is no chance to identify all positive labels and assign them precisely to training examples. The majority of labels is used very rarely, which leads to the problem of the long-tail distribution. In practical applications, learning algorithms run in rapidly changing environments. Hence, during testing/prediction phase new labels might appear that have not been present in the training set [4, 2]. This is the so-called\nzero-shot learning problem. Furthermore, typical performance measures used to assess the prediction quality of learning algorithms, such as 0/1 or Hamming loss, do not fit well to the nature of extreme classification problems. Therefore, other measures are often used such as precision@k [9] or the F-measure [6]. However, none of the above is appropriate to measure\npredictive performance in the long-tail problems or in the zero-shot setting. Hence, the goal is to design measures, which promote a high coverage of sparse labels [5].\n</p> \n <p>The seminar aimed at bringing together researchers interested in extreme classification to encourage discussion on the above mentioned problems, identify the most important ones and promising research directions, foster collaboration and improve upon the state-of-the-art algorithms. The meeting in this regard was very successful as participants from both academia and industry as well as researchers from both core machine learning and applied areas such as recommender systems, computer vision, computational advertising, information retrieval and natural language processing, were given the opportunity to see similar problems from different angles.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar consisted of invited talks, working groups, presentation of their results, and many informal discussions. The talks concerned among others such topics as: common applications of extreme classification, potential applications in bioinformatics and biotechnology, neural networks for extreme classification, learning theory for problems with a large number of labels, approaches for dealing with tail labels, learning and prediction algorithms, extreme classification challenges in natural language processing, multi-task learning with large number of tasks, pitfalls of multi-class classification, recommendation systems and their connection to extreme classification, counterfactual learning and zero-shot learning. The short abstracts of these talks can be found below in this report. The four working groups focused on the following problems: loss functions and types of predictions in multi-label classification, deep networks for extreme classification, zero-shot learning and long tail labels, and generalization bounds and log-time-and-space algorithms. Short summaries of the results obtained by the working groups can also be found below.\n</p> \n <p>During the seminar, we also discussed different definitions of extreme classification. The basic one determines extreme classification as a multi-class or multi-label problem with a very large number of labels. The labels are rather typical identifiers without any explicit meaning. However, there usually exists some additional information about similarities between the labels (or this information can be extracted or learned from data). From this point of view, we can treat extreme classification as a learning problem with a weak  structure over the labels. This is in difference to structured output prediction [1], where we assume much stronger knowledge about the structure. The most general definition, however, says that extreme classification concerns all problems with an extreme number of choices. The talks, working groups, and discussions have helped to gain a better understanding of existing algorithms, theoretical challenges, and practical problems not yet solved. We believe\nthat the seminar has initiated many new collaborations and strengthen the existing ones that will soon deliver new results for the extreme classification problems.\n</p> \n <p>\n</p> <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Bakir GH, Hofmann T, Sch\u00f6lkopf B, Smola AJ, Taskar B, Vishwanathan SVN (eds) Predicting\nStructured Data.

            "title": "Spoken Language Interaction with Virtual Agents and Robots (SLIVAR): Towards Effective and Ethical Interaction",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation and aims</h3> \n <p>\nRecent times have seen growing interest in spoken language-based interaction between human beings and so-called \u201cintelligent\u201d machines. Presaged by the release of Apple\u2019s Siri in 2011, speech-enabled devices \u2013 such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod \u2013 are now becoming a familiar feature in people\u2019s homes. Coming years are likely to see the theoretical basis, nor even practical guidelines, for the optimal integration of spoken language\ninteraction with such entities.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne possible reason for this situation is that the spoken language processing (SLP) and human-robot interaction (HRI) communities are fairly distinct, with only modest overlap. This means that spoken language technologists are often working with arbitrary robots (or limit themselves to conversational agents), and roboticists are typically using off-the-shelf spoken language components without too much regard for their appropriateness. As a consequence, an artefact\u2019s visual, vocal, and behavioural affordances are often not aligned\n(such as providing non-human robots with inappropriate human-like voices), and usability suffers \u2013 the human-machine interface is not \u201chabitable\u201d.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese usability issues can only be resolved by the establishment of a meaningful dialogue between the SLP and HRI communities. Both would benefit from a deeper understanding of each other\u2019s methodologies and research perspectives through an open and flexible discussion. The aim of the seminar was thus to bring together a critical mass of researchers from the SLP and HRI communities in order to (i) provide a timely opportunity to review the critical\nopen research questions, (ii) propose appropriate evaluation protocols for speech-based human-robot interaction, (iii) investigate opportunities to collect and share relevant corpora, and (iv) consider the ethical and societal issues associated with such machines.\n</p> \n <h3>Participants</h3> \n <p>A broad range of expertise was represented by the seminar participants, with a total of 38 attendees including industry experts, PhD students and academics from 14 different countries. The research areas of this interdisciplinary group included SLP, robotics, virtual agents, HRI, dialogue systems, natural language processing, as well as other intersections of SLIVAR.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar overview</h3> \n <p>to introduce themselves and their research, as well as share their insights on challenges and opportunities in SLIVAR. The presentations were interwoven with four stimulus talks given by leading experts in their respective fields. In light of these presentations, participants formed discussion groups based on the clustering of related topics. The seminar\u2019s schedule was intentionally adaptable to allow for discussions to shift and new groups to form over the\ncourse of the week. Alongside discussions, \u201cShow and Tell\u201d sessions were organised to provide participants an opportunity to demonstrate their work and further stimulate discussion. \n</p> \n <p>A non-exhaustive list of topics covered are outlined below along with a selection of the questions discussed within groups.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Adaptability\n<ul>\n<li><em> How do you cope with the frontier between user adaptation and system adaptation?</em>\n</li><li><em>Are there representations that better enable adaptivity to users? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Architecture\n<ul>\n<li><em> What are the desiderata for a spoken dialogue system-robot architecture? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Ethics\n<ul>\n<li><em> What can we do as scientists and engineers to create ethical agents? </em>\n</li><li><em> Should a robot be able to pursue goals that you do not know? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Evaluation\n<ul>\n<li><em> How do we evaluate HRI systems effectively and efficiently? </em>\n</li><li><em> What are the existing evaluation approaches for SLIVAR? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Interaction\n<ul>\n<li><em> How do we bridge the gap between dialogue management and interaction management? </em>\n</li><li><em> What kind of interaction modules are useful for dialogue and why? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Multimodality\n<ul>\n<li><em> What are the minimum representations units for different modalities? </em>\n</li><li><em> What is the added value of multimodal features of spoken interaction in HRI? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Scalability\n<ul>\n<li><em> How should we approach large scale supervised learning for NLU? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Speech in Action\n<ul>\n<li><em> How can we create challenging interaction situations where speech performance is coordinated to a partner's action? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Usability\n<ul>\n<li><em> What are the use cases for SLIVAR systems? </em>\n</li><li><em> What is the role of physical or virtual embodiment? </em>\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Seminar outcomes</h3> \n <p>The topics and questions outlined above facilitated a stimulating week of discussion and interdisciplinary collaboration, from which several next steps were established. These include participation in a number of workshops, special sessions and conferences, including but not limited to:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>SIGdial 2020 Special Session on Situated Dialogue with Virtual Agents and Robots \n</li><li>HRI 2020 Second Workshop on Natural Language Generation for HRI \n</li><li>IJCAI 2020 ROBOTDIAL Workshop on Dialogue Models for HRI \n</li><li>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot &amp; Human Interactive Communication \n</li><li>Interspeech 2020 \n</li></ul> \n <p>Research and position papers were also discussed, specifically focusing on the evaluation and ethics of SLIVAR systems. For the former, suggestions included a survey of existing evaluation approaches, a report paper on issues in SLIVAR and HRI evaluation, and investigations into the automation of SLIVAR system objective evaluation. For the latter, next steps included a survey of existing architectures for embedded ethical competence and a position\npaper on ethical machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe final, and perhaps most valuable outcome of the seminar was the establishment of a new SLIVAR community. There was a strong enthusiasm for the discussions during the seminar to continue with a second SLIVAR meeting, as well as suggestions for growing the community through the formal establishment of a special interest group. Overall, the seminar provided a unique opportunity to create a foundation for collaborative research in SLIVAR which will no doubt have a positive impact on future work in this field.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Laurence Devillers, Tatsuya Kawahara, Roger K.

            "title": "Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games: Revolutions in Computational Game AI",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe past decade has seen a rapid advent of new technologies in computational game playing. For a long time, artificial intelligence (AI) for 2-player deterministic board games was mainly implemented using tree search, employing the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, enhanced with some improvements which were often aimed at particular games. This approach worked well for most traditional games, but some games proved to be notoriously hard to tackle in this way. The textbook example of games for which regular tree search is inadequate, is Go.\n  </p> \n <p>\nTen years ago, the novel technique of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) became popular, as it was shown that using MCTS, the quality of AI for Go improved significantly, albeit not yet to the level of top-level human players. Many experts predicted that around 2030 Go AI would surpass human-level play. Much to the surprise of many, however, already in 2016 Google's AlphaGo defeated the human world champion in Go, using a combination of MCTS and deep convolutional networks to evaluate Go board positions and perform move selection. The networks were trained using millions of examples of human play, combined with self-play. A short while later, it was demonstrated with AlphaZero that self-play by itself suffices to train the networks to reach the necessary quality.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere is a long history of research into computational game AI for 2-player deterministic board games. However, since the turn of the century computational techniques have also been applied to games of a different nature, such as games for 3 or more players, games with imperfect information, and video games. Such games bring their own challenges, and often need very different approaches for creating game AI. Nevertheless, computational techniques may be applicable. Recent successes have been achieved in the playing of Poker (multiple players, imperfect information) and DotA (team-based video game). Deep learning techniques have been used to teach a game AI to play old Atari video games, and the highly complex game Doom, by only observing the screen.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese computational approaches to AI game playing have been highly successful, and have caused great enthusiasm in researchers and laymen alike. However, while they have opened up new possibilities for implementing strong game AI, they are definitely not the one-size-fits-all solution for all problems in computational game playing. The aim of the seminar was to build upon the foundations laid by the state-of-the-art in computational game playing, and (1) identify for which game AI problems the current state-of-the-art is inadequate or unsuitable, including the reasons why; (2) propose and investigate which improvements to the state-of-the-art may open up ways to apply it to a wider range of game AI problems; and (3) form ideas on which novel techniques may be employed to solve problems for which the current state-of-the-art is simply not suitable.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor the purpose of the seminar, a \"game\" is considered any simulated environment in which decisions can be taken in order to achieve a particular goal. This includes board games, card games, video games, simulations, and VR/AR applications. Decisions in a game are taken by \"players.\" In multi-player games, the goal is usually to \"win\" from other players, by reaching a pre-defined victory condition before any other player manages to do so. \"Game AI\" is a computer-controlled player. Good game AI takes decisions which are highly effective in achieving the goal. Cooperative games are also of interest, where the aim is for the players to work together to share in a victory. We wish to point out that games are often a reflection of some aspects of the real world, and allow investigating those aspects in a risk-free environment - good solutions for problems found in games may therefore have immediate applications in the real world.\n </p> \n <p>\nThe following is a (non-exhaustive) list of challenges to game AI which are hard to deal with using the current state-of-the-art. These challenges formed the basis for the discussions and investigations of the seminar.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Determining the limitations of MCTS and deep learning for computational game playing</b>: The state-of-the-art in computational game playing encompasses Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and deep convolutional networks to store game information. The recent successes of this approach in Go have made MCTS and deep learning the \"go-to\" techniques for implementing game AI. However, these techniques have many inherent limitations. MCTS needs extraordinary amounts of computer power and is therefore very expensive to use. While it can be parallelized easily, just adding more computer power has diminishing pay-offs. Moreover, there are many games for which MCTS clearly is not a suitable approach, for instance, games with a large branching factor where it is hard to come up with heuristics which pinpoint the branches which are most likely to contain the strong moves. As for deep learning, now that the early enthusiasm has waned a little, the first criticisms of it, which explain its many limitations, are already being published. Gaining insight into the limitations of MCTS and deep learning for game AI implementation will allow us to distinguish those games for which these techniques may be employed for strong game playing from those games for which different approaches are needed.\n</li><li><b>Defining more appropriate game complexity measures</b>: Game complexity is a measure which is supposed to indicate how difficult it is to implement game AI. It is usually expressed as the number of possible game states in base log_{10}. Beyond a complexity of 100 (10^{100} game states), it is highly unlikely that a game will ever be \"solved,\" i.e., will never be played perfectly. Researchers therefore aim for superhuman rather than perfect play. For a long time Go was considered the pinnacle of complexity in game playing, boasting a game complexity of 360. However, in the game AI domain, games have been researched with a much higher game complexity than Go. Typical examples of such games are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Arimaa</em>, a 2-player deterministic, perfect-information board game with a game complexity of 402.\n</li><li><em>Stratego</em>, a 2-player deterministic, imperfect-information board game with a game complexity of 535.\n</li><li><em>StarCraft</em>, a typical Real-Time-Strategy video game, with a varying game-tree complexity (depending on the parameters of the scenario) which is measured in the tens of thousands.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Learning game playing under adverse conditions</b>: In recent years, most research into game AI has moved towards \"learning to play\" rather than \"implementing an algorithm.\" Game AI can learn from observing examples of human play (provided a large enough dataset is available) or from self-play. Such learning has lead to strong results in some cases, but in many cases fails under adverse conditions. Examples of such conditions are:\n<ul>\n<li>Imperfect information, i.e., the results of decisions of the AI depending partly on unknown data.\n </li><li>Continuous action spaces, i.e., the AI in principle being allowed to take an unlimited number of decisions in a small time period; thus, an AI not only has to decide what actions it wants to take, but also how many and with which intervals.\n</li><li>Deceptive rewards, i.e., situations in which positive results achieved by the AI in the short term, in practice drive it away from the ultimate goal of the game in the long term.\n</li></ul>\nTo implement learning AI for wider classes of games, approaches must be devised to deal with such adverse conditions in systematic ways.\n</li><li><b>Implementing computational game AI for games with 3 or more players</b>: Most research into game AI is concerned with zero-sum 2-player games. The reason is obvious: in 2-player games, an objective ``best move'' always exists. With games that involve more than two players, which oppose each other, there often is no obvious \"best move.\" For instance, if there are three players in the game, if two of those players band together, in general the third one will have a very hard time winning the game, even when taking into account that the other two are collaborating. The main problem is that when one player is obviously doing better than the other two, it is to the advantage of the other two to collaborate against the envisioned winner. Therefore, in games with three or more players, it may be advantageous not to play better than the other players, in order not to become the target of a collaborative assault of the opponents. A pessimistic perspective, where the AI assumes that the opponents will actually form a block, will in general lead to much worse play than a perspective wherein the AI tries to form collaborations itself. This means that the AI must incorporate in its reasoning the attitudes of the other players, for instance in the form of player models.\nThe topic of AI for games of three or more players has been studied very little - a notable exception being the study of Poker, which is a relatively easy game in this respect considering the simplicity of the required player models and the very small state-space and game-tree complexities. Hundreds of thousands of games for three or more players exist, which by itself means that this challenge needs investigation. Moreover, when translating research findings to real-world challenges, the existence of more than two players is a given in most realistic situations.\n</li><li><b>Implementing AI for games with open-ended action spaces</b>: Certain classes of games have so-called \"open-ended action spaces,\" i.e., the number of possible actions is basically unlimited. One example of such a type of game is found in interactive fiction: these are puzzle games which the player controls by typing sentences in plain English. While each game only understands a limited set of verbs and nouns, the player is generally unaware of this list. Designers of such games aim to allow the player to give any English command which is reasonable in the circumstances described by the game. Another example of such a type of game is a tabletop role-playing game, in which players are allowed to perform any action at all, and a game master determines (within boundaries of a complex ruleset) what the result of the action is. Creating an AI for either a game master or a player of such a game requires the AI to have at least a basic understanding of the game world to be successful. In practice, studies into game AI focus almost exclusively on games where the action spaces are closed, which makes regular learning algorithms applicable. For games with open-ended action spaces, as of yet no successful approaches have been found.\n</li><li><b>General Game Playing</b>: In the domain of General Game Playing (GGP), games are defined by a set of rules, specified in a General Game Description Language (GGDL). The goal of researchers in this domain is to create an artificial intelligence which is able to play such a game, based on only the rules. Yearly competitions are held where researchers pose their AIs against each other in games which are unknown to them at the start of the competition. The state-of-the-art in such competitions is using MCTS, enhanced according to some general assumptions on the types of games that need to be played. This approach is unsurprising, as MCTS does not require knowledge of the game in question in order to do reasonably well. In fact, this approach is so strong and so easy to implement that all competitors use it. The danger of the success of MCTS for GGP is that the research in this area gets stuck at a dead end -- the same happened with the research into traditional game AI when for decades researchers only worked on small improvements to minimax and alpha-beta pruning, until MCTS came around to shake things up. It is highly unlikely that a blind and ostensibly \"stupid\" approach such as MCTS is the end-all of GGP AI implementations. It is therefore of particular interest to investigate novel approaches to GGP, which are not MCTS-based.  \n</li><li><b>  General Video Game Playing</b>: General Video Game Playing (GVGP) aims at designing an AI agent which is capable of successfully playing previously-unknown video games without human intervention. In the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework, video games are defined by a set of rules, sprites and levels, specified in a Video Game Description Language (VGDL). The VGDL was initially proposed and designed at the 2012 Dagstuhl Seminar on Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games. The GVGAI framework has been expanded to five different competition tracks: (1) single-player planning, (2) two-player planning, (3) learning (in which no forward model is given), (4) level generation and (5) rule generation. In the planning tracks a forward model of every game is available; MCTS has been the state-of-the-art algorithm in these tracks. However, MCTS is not applicable to the learning track as no forward model is given and thus no simulation of game playing is possible. Deep reinforcement learning is a potential approach for the GVGAI learning track, but has not been investigated yet. Other methods might have potential too. Determining the applicability of different methods to the creation of GVGAI is a novel and topical challenge. Of particular interest in this respect is the creation of an AI for the domain of general Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) games.\n</li><li><b>Computation for human-like play</b>: Virtually all research into computational game AI focuses on building a game-playing AI which is as strong as possible. Strength can objectively be measured by pitting different AIs against each other. In video-game AI research, it has been recognized that playing strength is, in general, not a major goal -- instead, much research in video game AI is aimed at making the AI play in an entertaining, interesting, or human-like manner. MCTS is notoriously unsuitable for selecting moves that are human-like, as it is simply based on finding the best outcome for the game as a whole. However, in situations where humans play against an AI, whether it is for entertainment or training, it is desirable that not only the best moves can be played by the AI, but also those moves which are interesting to explore or are on par with how a human might play. Almost no research has yet been done into computational human-like AI, which makes it a worthy challenge to take on.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar brought together computer scientists and industry experts with the common goals of gaining a deeper understanding of computational game AI, in particular to determine the limitations to the state of the art, to find new uses for the state-of-the-art, to explore new problems in the domain of computational game AI, and to investigate novel approaches to implementing computational game AI. Industry experts came not only from companies which specifically work in game AI research, but also from companies which use game AI in their products.\n </p> \n <p>  \n During the seminar we not only had discussions which investigate the topics  theoretically, but also spent part of the seminar on trying to achieve practical results. We did the same in the 2015 and 2017 seminars, which was met with great enthusiasm and led to some strong follow-ups. As in the previous seminars, these practical sessions were partly to test out new ideas, and partly competition-based, where different approaches were used to implement AI for new problems, which were then compared to each other by running a competition.  \n</p> \n <p>\nWhat was new for this particular seminar, is that we held expert talks during some of the evenings. These started with one or two experts giving a longer talk (between half an hour and an hour-and-a-half) on one of their specialisms, followed by a longer Q&amp;A session and a discussion. One evening was spent this way on using modern communication media to inform people about research (Tommy Thompson), one evening was spent on the details of DeepMind's AlphaStar (Tom Schaul), and one evening was spent on advanced search techniques in board games (Olivier Teytaud and Tristan Cazanave). These evenings were greatly appreciated by participants, and should remain part of this series of seminars.\n</p> \n <p>\nReports on the working groups are presented on the following pages. Many of these working groups have lead to collaborations, which will lead to papers to be published at conferences and in journals in the coming year. All in all, the general impression was that the participants and the organizers found the seminar a great success, and an inspiration for future research.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jialin Liu, Tom Schaul, Pieter Spronck, and Julian Togelius\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Dark Silicon: From Embedded to HPC Systems",
            "data": "\n <h3>Topic</h3> \n <h4>Dark Silicon</h4> \n <p>\nSemiconductor industry is hitting the utilization wall and puts focus on parallel and heterogeneous many-core architectures. While continuous technological scaling enables the high integration of 100s-1000s of cores and, thus, enormous processing capabilities, the resulting power consumption per area (the power density) increases in an unsustainable way. With this density, the problem of Dark Silicon will become prevalent in future technology nodes: It will be infeasible to operate all on-chip components at full performance at the same time due to the thermal constraints (peak temperature, spatial and temporal thermal gradients etc.).\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent research work on power management for Dark Silicon aims at efficiently utilizing the TDP (Thermal Design Power) budget to maximize the performance or to allocate full power budget for boosting single-application performance by running a single core at the maximum voltage or multiple cores at nominal level for a very short time period. Control-based frameworks are proposed to find the optimal trade-off between power and performance of many-core systems under a given power budget. The controllers are coordinated to throttle down the power when the system exceeds the TDP and to assign the task to the most suitable core to get the optimal performance. The work on near-threshold computing (NTC) enables operating multiple cores at a voltage close to the threshold voltage.\nThough this approach favors applications with thread-level parallelism at low power, it severely suffers from errors or inefficiency due to process variations and voltage fluctuations. On the other hand, the computational sprinting approach leverages Dark Silicon to power-on many extra cores for a very short time period (100s of millisecond) to facilitate sub-second bursts of parallel computations through multi-threading but thereby wasting a significant amount of energy due to leakage current. When doing so, it consumes power that significantly exceeds the sustainable TDP budget. Therefore, these cores are subsequently power-gated after the computational sprint. Alternate methods are Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost and AMD\u2019s Turbo CORE technologies that leverage the temperature headroom to favor high-ILP applications by increasing the voltage/frequency of a core while power-gating other cores. These techniques violate the TDP constraint for a short period (typically in terms of 10s of seconds) until the critical temperature is reached and then switches to a nominal operation. However, in case of dependent workloads, boosting of one core may throttle the other due to thermal coupling (i.e. heat exchange between different cores sharing the same die). Therefore, these boosting techniques lack efficiency in case dependent tasks of an application mapped to two different cores or, in general, for multiple concurrently executing applications with distinctive/dependent workloads.\n</p> \n <p>\nState-of-the-art boosting techniques assume a chip with only 10-20 cores (typically 16) and accordingly a full chip temperature violation for short time. However, in a large-scale system (with 100s--1000s cores), temperature hot spots may occur on certain chip portions far before the full chip\u2019s average temperature exceeds the critical temperature. Therefore, a chip may either get damaged before reaching the full chip critical temperature or TDP needs to be pessimistically designed. Advanced power management techniques are required to overcome these challenges in large-scale environments.\n</p> \n <h4>HPC - Dark Power</h4> \n <p>\nThe energy consumption of HPC systems is steadily growing. The costs for energy in the five year lifetime of large scale supercomputers already almost equal the cost of the machine. It is a necessity to carefully tune systems, infrastructure and applications to reduce the overall energy consumption.\nIn addition, the computing centers running very big systems face the problem of limited power provided by the energy providers and of the requirement for an almost constant power draw from the grid. The big machines, especially future exascale systems, are able to use more power if they are run at highest performance of all components than can be provided by the energy company.\nThus, a carefully optimized power distribution is necessary to make most efficient use of the provided power. The second aspect is the requirement of an almost constant power draw: Sudden changes from 20 MW to 10 MW for example, will be dangerous for the components of the power grid.\nIn addition, the contracts with the energy companies force the centers use the same power all the time by charging more, if it drops below or exceeds certain limits.\nThese challenges also require a careful and flexible power and resource management for HPC systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor a certain class of high-end supercomputer, there is a standard pattern of power consumption: During burn-in (and perhaps while getting a result to go onto the top-500 list) the machine will run dozens or hundreds of instances of Linpack. This code is quite simple and often hand-optimized, resulting in an unusually well-balanced execution that manages to keep vector units, cache lines and DRAM busy simultaneously. The percent of allocated power often reaches 95% or greater, with one instance in recent memory exceeding 100% and blowing circuit breakers. After these initial runs, however, the mission-critical simulation codes begin to execute and they rarely exceed 60% of allocated power. The remaining 40% of electrical capacity is dark: just as unused and just as inaccessible as dark silicon. While we would like to increase the power consumption (and thus performance) of these simulation codes, a more realistic solution in the exascale timeframe is hardware overprovisioning. This solution requires buying more compute resources than can be executed at maximum power draw simultaneously.\nFor example, if most codes are expected to use 50% of allocated power, the optimal cluster would have twice as many nodes.\n</p> \n <p>\nMaking this a feasible design requires management of power as a first-class resource at the level of the scheduler, the run-time system, and on individual nodes. Hardware power capping must be present. Given this, we can theoretically move power within and across jobs, using all allocated power to maximize throughput. The purpose of this seminar is to find this optimal level.\n</p> \n <h4>Hybrid (Design-time &amp; Run-time) Resource Management</h4> \n <p>\nToday\u2019s complex applications need to exploit the available parallelism and heterogeneity of -- non-darkened -- cores to meet their functional and non-functional requirements and to gain performance improvements.\nFrom a resource management\u2019s point of view, modern many-core systems come with significant challenges: (a) Highly dynamic usage scenarios as already observable in today's \"smart devices\" result in a varying number of applications with different characteristics that are running concurrently at different points in time on the system.\n(b) Due to the constraints imposed by the power density, the frequency at which cores can be operated as well as their availability as a whole, are subject to change. Thus, resource management techniques are required that enable a resource assignment to applications that satisfies their requirements but at the same time can consider the challenging dynamics of modern many-cores as a result of Dark Silicon.\n</p> \n <p>\nTraditional techniques to provide a binding or pinning of applications to processor that are optimal and predictable with respect to performance, timing, energy consumption, etc. are typically applied at design time and result in a kind of static system design.\nSuch a static design may, on the one hand, be too optimistic by assuming that all assigned resources are always available or it may require for a kind of over-allocation of cores to compensate for worst-case scenarios, e.g., a frequent unavailability of cores due to Dark Silicon.\nHence, the dynamic effects imposed in Dark Silicon require for novel modeling techniques already at design time.\n</p> \n <p>\nApproaches that focus on pure run-time resource management are typically designed with flexibility in mind and should inherently be able to dynamically react to changing applications as well as to the described effects of Dark Silicon.\nBut, future run-time resource management should not only react to a possible violation of a maximum power-density constraint, but also be able to proactively avoid such situations. The latter is an important \naspect of the system\u2019s dependability as well. At the same time, such dynamic resource management is also required to regard the applications\u2019 requirements.\nHere, a careful consideration on whether pure run-time management strategies enable the amount of predictability of execution qualities required by some applications becomes necessary.\n</p> \n <p>\nA recent research direction focuses on hybrid (design-time and run-time) approaches that explore this field of tension between a high predictability of design-time approaches and the dynamic adaptivity of run-time resource management.\nIn such approaches, design-time analysis and optimization of the individual applications is carried out to capture information like core allocation, task binding, or message routing and predict resulting quality numbers like timeliness, energy consumption, or throughput.\nThis information is then passed to the run-time resource management that then dynamically selects between the pre-optimized application embeddings.\nSuch strategies may not only be able to achieve application requirements even in such highly dynamic scenarios, but could even balance the requirements of the individual applications with the system\u2019s requirements -- in particular the maximum power density.\nOn the other hand, coarse-grained resource management as required for core allocation etc. may be considered to happen on a longer time scale.\nThe effects of Dark Silicon are instead on a smaller time scale with temperature almost immediately following changing workloads, thus, requiring for an intervention of the resource-management infrastructure.\nTherefore, novel concepts are required that enable a fine-grained resource management in the presence of Dark Silicon -- both in the context of abstraction layer and time scale -- without sacrificing the required efficiency but also predictable realization of application requirements via coarse-grained resource management.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>Traditionally, resource management techniques play an important role in both domains -- targeting very different systems.\nBut, as outlined before, resource management may be the key to tackle the problem of dark silicon that both communities face.\nThe aim of this seminar is to give an overview of the state of the art in the area of both embedded and HPC.\nIt will make both groups aware of similarities and differences.\nHere, the competences, experiences, and existing solutions of both communities shall stimulate discussions and co-operations that hopefully manifest in innovative research directions for many-core resource management in the dark silicon era.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview of Contributions</h3> \n <p>\nThis seminar presentations on the state-of-the-art in power and energy management in HPC and on techniques mitigating the Dark Silicon problem in embedded systems. In a joint session commonalities and differences as well as collaboration potential in the area of Dark Silicon were explored.\nThis subsection gives an overview of the topics covered by the individual speakers in the seminar. Please refer to the included abstracts to learn more about individual presentations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe HPC-related presentations where started with an overview presentation by Barry Rountree from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He introduced the field of HPC and of exascale systems. The new challenge is that these systems will be power limited and the hardware is overprovisioned. Techniques increasing the efficient usage of the available power need to be developed.\nExascale systems will be heterogeneous, even systems with homogeneous cores become heterogeneous due to production variability which takes effect under power limits. Careful distribution of power among jobs and within jobs as well as application and system configurations for jobs will be important techniques for these power limited and overprovisioned systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nAxel Auweter added to this introduction deep insights into the electricity market in Germany, its complex price structure, and the challenges for German compute centers to act successfully on that market.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn introduction from the embedded field to Dark Silicon was given by Sri Parameswaran from the University of New South Wales.\nThe continuous decrease in feature size without an appropriate decrease in the threshold voltage leads to increased power density.\nBetween 50% and 90% of dark silicon is expected in future chips.\nMitigation techniques are energy reduction techniques as well as spatial and temporal dimming of cores.\nConsiderable energy reduction can be achieved from heterogeneity on various levels, e.g., heterogeneous cores and the DarkNoC approach.\n</p> \n <h4>Dark Silicon due to Power Density</h4> \n <p>Several techniques were presented to mitigate the effect of power density.\nSantiago Pagani presented <em>spatial and temporal dimming of cores</em> to make best use of the thermal distribution on the chip.\nHe and Andrey Semin talked also about <em>boosting</em> the core frequency to exceed the power limit for a short time period to speedup computation.\nSergio Bampi presented <em>near threshold computing</em> as a potential solution based on further lowering the threshold voltage.\nMichael Niemier explored the potential of <em>new transistor technology</em> to mitigate the Dark Silicon effect.\n</p> \n <h4>Dark Silicon due to Limited Power</h4> \n <p>Mitigation techniques in this field are quite similar in mobile computing and HPC, although the overall objective is a bit different. While in mobile computing the minimal power required to meet the QoS requirements of applications is the goal, in HPC it is to go as fast as possible with the available power, may be considering energy efficiency and system throughput as well.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following approaches relevant for mobile computing and HPC were presented:\n<em>Heterogeneity</em> in various hardware aspects can be used to reduce the energy consumption of computations. Siddarth Garg and Tulika Mitra covered <em>performance heterogeneity</em> in scheduling tasks for big/little core combinations. Tulika Mitra and Andrea Bartolini talked about using <em>function heterogeneity</em>, e.g. accelerators, in mobile computing and HPC to increase energy efficiency. The <em>Heterogeneous Tile Architecture</em> was introduced in the presentations of Sri Parameswaran and Santiago Pagani as a general architecture enabling exploitation of heterogeneity to mitigate the Dark Silicon effect.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother approach is to determine the most efficient <em>application and system configuration</em>. <em>Static tuning</em> of parameters, such as the power budget of an application, were presented by Michael Knobloch and Tapasya Patki.\n<em>Dynamic tuning</em> techniques were covered in the presentations of Michael Gerndt, Martin Schulz, and Per Gunnar Kjeldsberg. Jonathan Eastep introduced the GEO run-time infrastructure for distributed machine-learning based power and performance management.\n</p> \n <p>\nKirk Cameron highlighted the unexpected effects of changing the core frequency due to non-linear dependencies. J\u00fcrgen Teich talked about <em>Invasive Computing</em> providing dynamic resource management not only for improving certain non-functional application aspects but also for increasing the predictability of those aspects.\n</p> \n <p>\nWolfgang Nagel and Sri Parameswaran presented <em>energy efficient network architectures</em>. They covered heterogeneous on-chip network architectures and wireless communication within compute clusters. \n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Approximate computing</em> was presented by Sergio Bampi. It allows trading off accuracy and energy. Pietro Cicotti covered in his presentation <em>data movement optimization</em> within a CPU to save energy.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Application and system monitoring</em> is a pre-requisite for many of the above techniques.\nMichael Knobloch, Wolfgang Nagel, and Kathleen Shoga presented application and system monitoring techniques based on software as well as hardware instrumentation.\nMany compute centers are installing infrastructures to gather sensor values from the whole facility to enable future analysis.\nIn addition to performance and energy measurements for application, higher level information about the application characteristics is useful in taking tuning decisions.\nTapasay Patki presented <em>application workflows</em> as a mean to gather such information.\n</p> \n <p>\nBesides these generally applicable techniques, some presentations covered also techniques that are specific to HPC installations with their batch processing approach and large compute systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nAndrea Bartolini highlighted in his presentation the holistic multiscale aspect of power-limited HPC. The application, the compute system, and the <em>cooling infrastructure</em> have to be seen as a complex integrated system.\n<em>Power-aware scheduling</em>, presented by Tapasya Patki and Andrea Bartolini, can significantly improve the throughput of power-limit HPC systems and <em>moldable jobs</em> can improve the effect of power-aware scheduling significantly. Isaias Compres presented <em>Invasive MPI</em>, an extension of MPI for programming moldable application.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusion</h3> \n <p>At the end of the seminar a list of takeaway messages was collected based on working-group discussions followed by an extensive discussion of all participants:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Dark silicon is a thermal problem in embedded and a power problem in HPC. HPC can cool down while in the embedded world you can't. Therefore HPC can power up everything if they have enough power. But the costs for providing enough power for rare use cases have to be rectified.\n</li><li> Better tools are required on both sides to understand and optimize applications. \n</li><li> Better support for optimizations is required through the whole stack from high level languages down to the hardware.\n</li><li> In both communities run-time systems will get more important. Applications will have to be written in a way that run-time systems can work effectively.\n</li><li> Task migration is of interest to both groups in combination with appropriate run-time management techniques. \n</li><li> Embedded also looks at specialized hardware designs while HPC has to use COTS. In HPC, the machine architecture might be tailored towards the application areas. Centers are specialized for certain customers.\n</li><li> Heterogeneity on architecture level is important to both groups for energy reduction. \n</li><li> Better analyzable programming models are required, providing composable performance models. \n</li><li> HPC will have to live with variability. The whole tuning step has to change since reproducibility will no longer be given.\n</li><li> Hardware-software co-design will get more important for both groups.\n</li><li> Both areas will see accelerator-rich architectures.\nSome silicon has to be switched off anyway, thus these can be accelerators that might not be useful for the current applications.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Hans Michael Gerndt and Michael Gla\u00df and Sri Parameswaran and Barry L.

            "title": "Serverless Computing",
            "data": "\n <p>\nServerless computing holds a significant promise for the modern, digital society. For the past seven decades, our society has increasingly required ever-cheaper, ever-more convenient, and ever-faster computing technology. In the late-1950s, leasing time on an IBM 701 cost $15,000 per month ($135,000 in 2020 dollars). Today, we can lease many times this computing power for mere pennies but need to be careful about the actual cost of doing so. Cloud computing, that is, the utility providing IT as a service, on-demand and pay-per-use, is a widely used computing paradigm that offers large economies of scale and promises extreme environmental efficiency. Born from a need to make cloud computing services more accessible, fine-grained, and affordable, serverless computing has garnered interest from both industry and academia.\nIn our vision, serverless computing can meet this need, but to do this it will have to overcome its current status of emergent technology or risk its demise.\n</p> \n <p>\nCloud computing is already an established technology. Today, more than three-quarters of the US and European companies, and many private individuals, use cloud computing services. The serverless market is blooming and has already exceeded $200 billion in 20203. The cost of one hour on a cloud computer leased on-demand can be lower than a cent and all the major cloud providers offer inexpensive access to diverse and state-of-the-art hardware. However cheap, cloud computing still poses daunting operational challenges to software\nprofessionals, in particular, how to manage the selection, operation, and other aspects of using cloud infrastructure (in short, servers). Correspondingly, it poses significant challenges to systems designers and administrators, related to keeping the cloud infrastructure efficient and sustainable.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn emerging class of cloud-based software architectures, serverless computing, focuses on providing software professionals the ability to execute arbitrary functions with low or even no overhead in server management. Serverless computing leverages recent developments in the miniaturization of software parts through microservice-based architectures, in the operationalization of small self-contained execution units through containers, and in their\nintegration in service models such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). Truly, serverless is more [12]. Early research successes [6, 15, 17, 18, 22] complement numerous industrial applications [9], from business-critical to scientific computing, from DevOps to side-tasks. Already, IT spending on serverless computing should exceed $8 billion per year, by 2021.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever promising, serverless computing has yet to mature and presents many hard, open challenges. There are numerous signs and reports [11, 14] that serverless computing poses critical challenges in software engineering, parallel and distributed systems operation, and performance engineering [10]. For example, software engineering could help overcome challenges in the developer experience [23], including testing, tooling, functionality, and\ntraining and education. The systems side requires, among others, new approaches for deployment, monitoring, and general operation, and also specific advances in security, cost predictability, and life-cycle management for cloud functions. Performance engineering raises many hard aspects, such as performance optimization, engineering for cost-efficiency, and various forms of fast online scheduling. These combined challenges are distinctive from\nthe general challenges of cloud computing, for example, because the fine-grained, often event-driven nature of serverless computing typically requires approaches that are lightweight and able to respond without delay.\n</p> \n <p>The goal of the seminar is to <em>combine the views of a diverse and high-quality group of researchers spanning three disciplines</em>: software engineering, parallel and distributed systems, and performance engineering. The Dagstuhl Seminar will be a catalyst. Attendees discussed the open challenges and opportunities of serverless computing for the next decade, with a\nfocus on at least the following crucial aspects and questions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Envision serverless systems and applications in the next decade. How to leverage the freedom from operational concerns? How to overcome the challenge and enjoy the benefits of fine granularity?\n</li><li> How to properly engineer serverless software and systems? What are the emerging architectural patterns for serverless systems and applications? How to test and debug serverless systems and applications?\n</li><li> How to characterize, model, and analyze serverless systems and applications? How to understand the diverse serverless workloads?    \n</li><li> How to manage the resources used in serverless operations? How to schedule and orchestrate in this environment? How to manage specific application classes, such as computer vision, enterprise workflows, HPC, DevOps?    \n</li><li> How to deploy and manage the full lifecycle of serverless applications? How to add ML-capabilities to feedback loops? How to break through the operational silos?    \n  </li><li> How to support privacy, security, dependability, and other desirable operational properties for serverless applications and systems?    \n</li><li> Beyond computer systems, how to consider serverless systems and applications from a holistic, cyberphysical perspective?  \n</li></ul> \n <h3>Core Topics</h3> \n <p>The seminar focussed on the following key topics related to serverless computing:\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Topic 1. Design decisions for serverless systems, platforms, and ecosystems.</b> As the serverless model is increasingly being adopted in industry [9], the challenges of properly designing these systems and the platforms on which they run are becoming more apparent. These challenges include important problems [10], such as: how to reduce the serverless overhead added by the platform to the (commonly lightweight) functions representing the business logic of the application (e.g., see [20]), how to ensure proper performance isolation\nwhile making efficient use of the shared infrastructure (e.g., see [1]), how to partition the functions [5, 6], and how to properly schedule functions and route requests to these functions (e.g., see [2]), in such a way that the service level objectives (SLO\u2019s) are adequately met, among other important challenges. There is also the question of running serverless workloads\nalongside conventional applications, e.g., HPC, big data, machine learning. The experiences of the attendees to the seminar, some of which have already started working in these domain and others with established experience in prior technologies from which we may learn and transfer knowledge (e.g., grid computing), will enable us to focus on determining which of these decisions the community should be focusing on, and how to establish adequately prioritized research agendas.\n</p> \n <p><b>Topic 2. Software engineering of serverless applications, but also systems, platforms, and ecosystems.</b> To increase the domain of application for serverless computing, the functionality it can express needs to become increasingly more complex, which contrasts with the perceived simplicity of the model [23]. What is the trade-off between simplicity and expressiveness? Which composition models can ensure that serverless workflows can be maintained and developed (and updated) long term? Serverless functions should become\nincreasingly interoperable, and applications should become able to leverage the services of any serverless platform [6]. How to make serverless functions vendor-agnostic and how to run serverless applications across cloud federations? Which architectural patterns are useful for serverless applications? How to consider and support the legacy part of serverless\napplications? The development processes, from the macro-view of how teams coordinate to deliver applications that could operate in an external ecosystem, to the micro-view of how to develop and test a serverless function, will have to consider the new aspects raised by serverless computing. What are effective development processes? What tools and IDE features are needed? What versioning and testing, and what CI/CD protocols should be used? How to evolve legacy software toward serverless-native applications? How to ensure open-source software becomes FAIR software [13]?\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Topic 3. Applications and domain requirements for serverless computing.</b> Preliminary studies of serverless applications at large [9] have shown that there is a wide variety of scenarios for which industry and academia are adopting serverless approaches. From business-critical workloads, to automating DevOps, scientific computing, and beyond, the diversity of the applications and domains for which serverless is being applied poses significant challenges\nwhen attempting to optimally manage the resources and infrastructure on which these applications depend. It is important to properly understand the variety of these applications and domain requirements, engaging both academia and industry in the discussion. These requirements should relate to various aspects in software engineering, parallel and distributed systems, and performance engineering. For example, a domain-based approach could help increase scalability [3]; considering the structure of packages in composing a deployable serverless application could improve scheduling performance [2]; and serverless functions and architectures should be considered during performance tests [8, 28].\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Topic 4. Evaluation of serverless computing systems, platforms, and ecosystems.</b> The performance trade-offs of serverless systems are not yet well understood [28], thus highlighting the importance of proper evaluation and benchmarking of these systems. However, the high level of abstraction and the opaqueness of the operational-side make evaluating these platforms\nparticularly challenging. As recent efforts are starting to focus on this topic [24, 28], it is important to engage the community on an early discussion on the best approaches to tackle this problem. How to understand and engineer the performance of serverless systems? How to translate the findings, when serverless systems are opened to external developers (as platforms) or take part in much larger systems of systems (and even ecosystems)? How to account for parts of the ecosystem being closed-source and even acting as black-boxes?\nHow to identify and even explain the performance bottlenecks such systems, platforms, and ecosystems experience? How to use evaluation results with other performance engineering techniques to control and improve the performance of serverless systems, platforms, and ecosystems?\n</p> \n <p>An important focus of inquiry has recently become prominent in computer systems research: the reproducibility of evaluation results and of experiments in general [19, 21]. Not doing so can result in misleading results [26], and in results that cannot be obtained again [25] sometimes even under identical circumstances and by their original authors [7]. This leads to a possible loss of faith in the entire field [4, 27]. \"How to benchmark serverless\nsolutions reproducibly?\" is an important question to address with diverse expertise and fresh ideas.\n</p> \n <h4>Synopsis and Planned Actions</h4> \n <p>We would like to thank the Dagstuhl staff and sponsors for this unique seminar opportunity even under the constraints of the pandemic. During the seminar, we had almost 45h of online meetings (not counting sub-meetings): some 9-10h of online meetings each seminar day. Three 3h sessions per day were spread around the clock to allow participation from various timezones. Even under these constraints, we experienced enormous participation and active discussion involvement. In brief, the seminar week was structured as follows:\n</p> \n <p>\nAfter each participant presented her/himself to the plenary, we formed four working groups according to the topics above. The discussions were kick-started by four distinguished keynotes, in plenary, with the respective talk abstracts included in this report:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>\"Serverless Predictions: 2021-2030\" given jointly by Pedro Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez (Universitat\nRovira i Virgili \u2013 Tarragona, ES) and Bernard Metzler (IBM Research-Zurich, CH)\n</li><li>\"Developer Experience for Serverless: Challenges and Opportunities\" given by Robert Chatley (Imperial College London, GB)\n</li><li>\"Federated Function as a Service\" given jointly by Kyle Chard (University of Chicago,\nUS) and Ian T. Foster (Argonne National Laboratory \u2013 Lemont, US)\n</li><li>\"Characterizing Serverless Systems\" given by Mohammad Shahrad (University of British Columbia \u2013 Vancouver, CA)\n</li></ul> \n <p>Each of the four working groups held five 3h sessions with their teams, including three 1h one-on-one meetings with the other groups. The four working groups report individually on their outcomes and list identified research challenges. In a consolidation phase, we identified and planned nine focused topics for future joint research among the participants.  \n</p> \n <p>\nComplemented by a Slack workspace for the seminar participants, a focused continuation of discussions beyond the seminar week was enabled: Among others, a discussion initiated and led by Samuel Kounev on the notion of serverless computing, started during the seminar, continued well beyond. We include the outcome of this \"panel discussion\" in Section 5.1 of this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers and participants decided to jointly work toward at least one high-profile magazine article reporting on the seminar outcome and research agenda.\n</p> \n <p>\nFurthermore, during the seminar the motion was raised to establish a conference series on serverless computing. We see good potential for a new conference on \"Serverless Software and Systems\" as a cross-community event embracing, at least, the disciplines of software engineering, system engineering, and performance engineering. Working potentially in concert with an existing workshop series in the field, we plan to initiate this step in the coming months. We hope that one day in the future, we can proudly look back and say that this Dagstuhl seminar 21201 was an important trigger event.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li> Z. Al-Ali, S.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis document summarizes the insights gathered during the seminar. We first provide an overview of the motivation for this seminar before presenting an overview of the activities that occurred during these five days. We then provide a series of outputs that we gathered in addition to the list of abstract provided on the website.\n</p> \n <h3>1. Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nInteractive systems are becoming increasingly complex and diversified, often comprised of multiple interconnected devices, with many different functionalities. They are slowly merging within our everyday objects. Such systems are becoming ubiquitous. Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary field of study that explores the design and implementation of such embedded, networked computing systems. Due to the novel aspect of the technologies involved and the multidisciplinary nature of skills needed to design such systems, teaching and training new innovators in this field are not well addressed through traditional programs and instruction. Consequently, it is important to ask several questions about the training and education needed to help students become valuable members and leaders of ubicomp teams. Three central questions about ubiquitous computing education emerge: why, what and how, with the goal of enhancing ubicomp education through interdisciplinary perspectives:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>WHY is training in ubicomp needed? Is it enough to train experts in narrow domains (e.g. those who can create low-power embedded circuits, or those who can make usable applications), and then bring them together in teams that will tackle ubicomp problems? Or do we need specialized training that targets ubicomp in addition to domain expertise? There is broad consensus that we do need specialized training, but often this argument is based on intuition and anecdotal evidence. We approach this question by first asking: what are the grand challenges that we expect our students to tackle in the world (e.g. privacy, sustainability) by inventing and developing ubicomp solutions? Next, we ask: who can better address the challenges: teams of domain experts, or teams where at least some team members have specialized ubicomp education? Answers to these questions will clearly identify problems that might exist with current ubicomp educational approaches.\n</li><li> WHAT should constitute training in ubicomp? Once we identify the grand challenges, we need to ask further questions. What are the values, knowledge, and skills we should train students in ubicomp? What are the topics that should be covered? How do these depend on the background of students or their degree program? Answers to these types of questions will allow us to set goals for ubicomp education.\n</li><li> HOW should we teach and engage a diverse body of students? Once we identify specific goals for ubicomp education, we need to ask ourselves how those goals can be achieved. How does the unique nature of ubicomp challenge the current pedagogical approaches? How can we create new pedagogical approaches for teaching and training in ubiquitous computing? Answers to these types of questions will help create the appropriate tools to reach our ubicomp education goals.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>2. Overview of the activities</h3> \n <p>Our goal was to create a community to support new forms of teaching, training, and learning in ubiquitous computing. Our activities were centered on our main questions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Day 1, we explored the WHO and WHY. Each participant presented briefly their research and current teaching, and highlighted what they see are the main challenges for teaching ubicomp in the morning. We then brainstormed and discussed why is is important to rethink the way we teach ubicomp material and what are the grand challenges associated to this change. \n</li><li> Day 2, we explored the WHAT. In groups, we defined the curriculum for Ubicomp education for different types of students, different degree levels, as well as identified what are the learning goals. One discussion that came up relating to the limits of Ubicomp material, specifically how complex it currently is to define what is ubicomp.\n</li><li> Day 3, we explored the HOW, and particularly brainstormed about the challenges related to ubiquitous education. Participants generated a list of their current active learning methods or tools and exchanged them in a speed dating fashion with each other. \n</li><li> Day 4, we explored further the HOW. In groups, we developed and experienced new active learning pedagogies on ubiquitous computing topics. We also discussed pedagogies for academic ubicomp programs.\n</li><li> Day 5, we wrapped up the seminar and plan for concrete actions for the future, in particular, ideas for the next Dagstuhl seminar.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>3. The challenges of teaching Ubicomp (WHY)</h3> \n <p>\nFigure 1 illustrates the grand challenges of teaching Ubicomp from a motivation point of view. We have identified several themes including (1) who is the audience in terms of diversity, motivation, population; and how (2) these aspects particularly impact their engagement and what methods can we use to better engage with students. We also talked about the difficulty that Ubicomp brings in terms of being a multi-disciplinary field and we highlight the fact that it is difficult to choose (3) which topics should be covered and which ones should not be covered in a particular case. What are the boundaries of Ubicomp? In fact, our discussions highlighted that there is not a clear (4) definition of Ubicomp. We talked about (5) issues with the high workload of both teaching and learning about ubicomp, and how research-led teaching could alleviate some of these issues. We discussed (6) scale issues, i.e. how to teach to a large number of students (and provide feedback) when it seems that certain aspects of Ubicomp teaching (e.g. workshop activities) can only be taught to smaller groups. We pointed out the issues of (7) space and that Ubicomp teaching is based on traditional classroom but also new types of spaces such as workshops, hackerspaces, and maker spaces. Furthermore, we discussed other media types such as (8) online lectures. We also discussed more general topics such as (9) the impact of ubicomp (e.g. on business and industry) and the future of universities and how this relates to ubicomp education.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4234/image2.png\" width=\"60%\"/> \n <h3>4. The Ubicomp curriculum (WHAT)</h3> \n <p>\nTable 1 illustrates the topics central to Ubicomp Education brainstormed during the seminar. We split the participants (including the organizers) in four groups designing curriculum (standalone lecture or program) for different students (undergraduate UG or postgraduate PG) and technical (Computer Science) or non-technical (Interdisciplinary) background). We wish for this document (that we also plan to put onto our online web platform) to be used as guidelines for teachers in order to provide a better and unified Ubicomp curriculum across different institutions and countries.\n<img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4235/Tabelle1.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p> <h3>5. Existing active learning methods for Ubicomp (HOW)</h3> \n <p>\nFigure 2 illustrates the grand challenges of teaching Ubicomp from a method's point of view. This was the result of a brainstorming with participants following the curriculum creation. We found that (1) managing the workload was a theme recurring again (as we also mentioned it in the initial brainstorming in Figure 1). We noted that one difficulty of teaching Ubicomp was (2) the lack of differentiation with other CS, HCI or Design teaching material. We also though this could create issue in (3) attacking certain types of students and that possibly, depending on the demographic, different terminology (Ubicomp, Interactive Systems, Interaction Design etc.) might be used. We raised issues in (4) evaluation and assessment potentially raised by (5) the interdisciplinarity of the community which makes it hard to assess student but also to teach so diverse material. We discussed issue in (6) engaging with students and enforcing skill acquisition (surface vs. deep learning). Finally we also add other issues such as (7) scaling of students, (8) project styles, (9) reaching to real end-users, (10) having input from industry and the (11) format of the lecture (e.g. online). We finally discussed about the issues raised by (12) admin and physical resources.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4236/image1.png\" width=\"60%\"/> \n <h3>6. Innovative active learning methods for Ubicomp (HOW)</h3> \n <p>\nThe next main activity focused on generating new educational material that may be difficult to generate, or missing, from a current curriculum. Participants formed six groups, they selected a topic, and investigated new active learning methods as well as initial teaching material related to the topic.  The specific topics for each group were selected from topics and challenges highlighted earlier in the seminar. Next, groups formed pairs of groups, and each group tested their content and methods on other group and received feedback, before iterating on their design.  Finally, teams presented a summary of their new materials to the group (Table 2).\n<img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4237/Tabelle2.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n</p> <p>\nFrom the discussions following up the presentation we also noted some actions to do:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Create a repository or playlist (youtube) or videos that can be used within the community and define what is Ubicomp.\n</li><li> Ask participants to upload a 2 minutes video of their definition of Ubicomp that can be used in class to show the variety of what people think is Ubicomp.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>7. Future Steps</h3> \n <p>Although this seminar addressed many questions the organisers had originally highlighted, it also opened new exciting directions to explore and new challenges. To start addressing them we identified the main following avenues for future work and future events:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Follow-up Dagstuhl seminar on writing a textbook\n</li><li> Follow-up Dagstuhl seminar focussing on the industrial side, e.g. what skills do students need for the society we will built in 5/10/20/50 years?\n</li><li> Using the website to keep the community alive as well as the access to material, and also create a video channel to create a repository of ubicom examples.\n</li><li> We also have discussed about 3-4 follow up papers to be written among participants and organizers.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>8.

            "data": "\n <p>\nNetworks are all around us.\nAt any moment in time we are driven by, and are an integral part of, many\ninterconnected and dynamically changing networks. Our species has evolved in the context of diverse ecological, biological, social, and other types of networks over thousands of years. We created\ntelephone and power networks, road and airline networks, the Internet and the World Wide Web. We model biological processes with metabolic and protein networks, fake news and rumors with epidemic networks, and even the brain with neural networks. The study of such large-scale networks is one of the prominent generators of big data. Analyzing, exploring, and understanding these complex, interdependent, multi-level networks requires new, more efficient, and more intuitive graph analysis and visualization approaches. \nThis is confirmed in a 2017 VLDB study by Sahu et al. about how graphs are used in practice, where analysts identified scalability and visualization as the most important issues to address.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent advances in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures make it possible to map humankind's collective scholarly knowledge and technology expertise by using topic maps on which \"continents\" represent major areas of science (e.g., mathematics, physics, or medicine) and zooming reveals successively more detailed subareas. Basemaps of science and technology (S&amp;T) are generated by analyzing citations links between millions of publications and/or patents. \"Data overlays\" (e.g., showing all publications by one scholar, institution, or country or the career trajectory of a scholar as a pathway) are generated by science-locating relevant publication records based on topical similarity. Science maps are widely used to compare expertise profiles, to understand career trajectories, and to communicate emerging areas. The recent National Academy of Science  Colloquium on <em>Modeling and Visualizing Science Developments</em> co-organized by B\u00f6rner\nshowcased the utility of predictive modeling and large-scale mapping efforts, e.g., in support of ranking institutions, analyzing job market developments, and innovation diffusion and technology adoption.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite the demonstrated utility of large-scale S&amp;T maps, current approaches do not scale to the hundreds of millions of data records now available. Most users have a hard time reading large-scale networks and few can traverse or derive knowledge from multi-level presentations of networks. Most maps of science, technology, or jobs data support exactly one level of detail. Very few even support two levels such as the UCSD map of science.\nA key challenge is designing efficient and effective methods to visualize and interact with more than 100 million scholarly publications at multiple levels of resolution. \n</p> \n <p>\nGiven results from our prior studies on the effectiveness and memorability of map-like visualization of large graphs, we are interested to bring together leading experts to design a multi-level, large-scale map of science that can be used by experts and the general public alike.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe notion of multiple-levels-of-detail graph representation can be captured with Multi-Level Graph Sketches (MLGS) that take a static map-like representation to a multi-level setting needed for exploring and interacting with large, real-world networks. Using the familiar  map metaphor, multi-level graph algorithms can make it possible to identify important nodes, major pathways, and clusters across multiple levels. Specifically, we aim to develop efficient algorithms with theoretical and practical guarantees for creating Multi-Level Graph Sketches (MLGS) in support of visual analytics tasks for large network exploration, navigation, and communication. Unlike existing methods for visualizing multi-level networks based on meta-nodes and meta-edges, the MLGS approach can provide real nodes (prototypes) and real paths (backbones) for each level, similar to geographic maps that show real cities and real roads at every level of detail. \n</p> \n <p>\nResearch questions included: (1) designing efficient algorithms for MLGS: advance the state-of-the-art in graph algorithms by generalizing the notion of graph spanners to multiple levels. (2) utilizing MLGS algorithms in visualization: applying the MLGS representation in the context of network analysis and visualization for interacting with large networks, which combines the MLGS approach with clustering, layout, and map-like visualization. (3) developing a new approach for science classification, lookup, and topical mapping service in support of data-driven decision making by students, teachers, and administrators. (4) validating the new algorithms and visualizations: evaluation based on quantitative metrics such as efficiency/scalability, stress/distortion and precision/recall, as well as qualitative metrics based on human subject studies of the utility of visualizations along with readability, engagement, and memorability.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of this seminar was to bring together researchers coming from information visualization, psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, graph drawing, computational geometry, cartography, and GIS with interests in \"science of science\" to discuss novel graph mining and layout algorithms and their application to the development of science mapping standards and services.  \n</p> \n <p>\nDue to the pandemic, we had a \"hybrid\" seminar with only 5 in-person participants and 25 by-zoom participants; see Fig. 1. With participants from more than 10 different countries and at least 5 different time-zones (some as much as 9 hours behind Central Dagstuhl time), this was a new experience for most of us and  definitely different from previous Dagstuhl seminars. Nevertheless, we attempted to adapt by having additional evening events and moving the traditional Wednesday excursion to the morning. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs this was a highly interdisciplinary seminar, we started the event with talks that introduced the state of the art in the participating fields on a high level.\nAfter the introductory presentations, we presented our initial research problems and discussed further questions in an open-problem session. \n </p> \n <p>\nA set of 4-6 research problems was then finalized and the formation of working groups for these problems was completed by the end of the second day. The remaining three days were dedicated to working-group meetings, progress reports, and initial write-ups.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main expected outcome of this seminar will be a special issue of the journal <a href=\"https://www.computer.org/digital-library/magazines/cg/call-for-papers-special-issue-on-multi-level-graph-representations-for-big-data-in-science\">IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications</a> on the main topics of the seminar. Specifically, we expect 4-6 research papers on the problems discussed by the working groups.  Longer term goals include: improved collaborations and communications between the different communities brought together for this seminar, improved maps of science for SciMap2020, and new multi-level graph algorithms and approaches.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Katy B\u00f6rner and Stephen G.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar was successful in bringing the following two communities together:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The community that works on machine learning (ML), both on theoretical topics and on applications to areas such as robotics and cyber-physical systems, and\n</li><li>The community that works on formal methods (FM), both on computational proof\ntechniques and on applications to formal verification and program/controller synthesis.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nBoth communities have long and vibrant histories, with associated conferences and journals. However, they have rarely intersected. The machine learning community has traditionally focused on <em>inductive</em> learning from data, with the data set considered as partial (potentially noisy) observations of some phenomenon. The formal methods community has traditionally emphasized automated <em>deduction</em>, e.g., using theorem proving or model checking, as a core reasoning method, with a heavy emphasis placed on formal models and proofs of correctness using those models. However, recent ideas and methods have appeared that demonstrate new connections between the two disciplines, which suggested that the time is ripe for a meeting to promote cross-fertilization between the areas at a deep technical level. This seminar has been a significant step forward to bring the two communities together.\n</p> \n <p> More concretely, the Seminar and the interaction it facilitated has brought three kinds of benefits. First, formal methods can benefit from a more effective use of machine learning techniques particularly in the context of automated synthesis. Similarly, the increasing use of machine learning in applications that require a high level of assurance points to the need for integration with formal methods. However, the potential synergies between the two areas go beyond a simple application of the techniques in one area to the other area. Importantly, there is new fundamental science to be explored in the intersection of machine learning and formal methods, related to the the confluence of inductive and deductive reasoning, and which can inform a range of new industrially-relevant applications as well.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar had about 40 participants from both the FM and ML communities. The\norganizers took several steps to foster discussion and cross-pollination of ideas between the two communities, including the following:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Formal Methods participants, and a half-day tutorial on Formal Methods for a Machine Learning audience. These tutorials helped to establish a common vocabulary to discuss ideas, problems and solutions.\n</li><li>Sessions were organized based on themes that emerged in discussions before the seminar and during the first day. The list of session topics is as follows:\n</li></ul> \n <ol>\n<li> Probabilistic Programming\n</li><li> Teaching and Oracle-Guided Synthesis\n</li><li> Safe Learning-Based Control\n</li><li> Probabilistic Program Analysis\n</li><li> Adversarial Analysis and Repair for Machine Learning\n</li><li>Inductive Synthesis and Learning\n</li><li>Machine Learning for Theorem Proving and Optimization\n</li><li>Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning\n</li><li>Deep Learning and Verification/Synthesis\n</li></ol> \n <p>In organizing these sessions, the organizers tried to combine speakers from both ML and FM areas to foster discussion and comparison of approaches.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Seating arrangements at meals were organized so that (a) each table had an approximately qual number of participants from both communities, and (b) the seating was randomly hanged from meal to meal.\n</li><li>A joint session was organized with the concurrent seminar on analysis and synthesis of floating-point programs. This session had a panel discussion on floating-point issues in machine learning programs.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAfter the seminar, we have heard positive feedback from multiple participants. One told us that he started a new research project as a direct result of the seminar. A group of participants are planning to continue the interaction via joint workshops at major venues of both communities such as CAV, PLDI, ICML, NIPS, etc.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Susmit Jha, Andreas Krause, Sanjit A.

            "title": "Machine Learning in Sports",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSports has become an incredibly data rich field with the advent of data sources such as event data (e.g., time and locations of actions), tracking data (i.e., positional data), and athlete monitoring (e.g., bio-sensors, IMUs, GPS). These data are commonly and widely collected across multiple different sports, both on a professional and recreational level.  The advent of such data raises the need to exploit the collected data both from the theoretical (e.g., sports modeling) as well as practical (e.g., training in top level sports) perspective. Problem-solving solutions can only be provided by an interaction between the sports science &amp; informatics (S&amp;I) and the machine learning (ML) communities. Machine learning is emerging as a powerful, new paradigm for sports analytics, as it provides novel approaches to making sense of the collected data. However, the S&amp;I and ML communities are traditionally separate, each with its own agenda. The seminar aims to bring together top researchers and practitioners who are active in these two fields that can contribute to an assessment of their potential synergies.\n</p> \n <p> \nWe structured the seminar along five different themes, each of which was the focus of between half and a full day.  Given the diversity of the participants' backgrounds  in terms of discipline, each theme began with overview to get everyone on the same page. Then there were more detailed presentations. The five themes were:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Machine learning meets sports</b> The goal of this session was to provide an overview of some of the machine learning techniques (predictive modeling, text mining) and how they can be applied in the sports context. The illustrative applications where ML can play a role included assessing the performances of teams and players, supporting sport broadcast, assessing fans reactions to rule changes and helping reduce the time burden on video analysts.  \n</li><li><b>Sports science meets machine learning</b> The goal was to provide an overview of basic concepts in sports science to inform researchers from machine learning. The basic concepts were the relation between competition, training and athlete's abilities, the structure of performance in different sports, and the demand for support in sports practice. In particular, the structure of team sports as dynamic interaction processes with emergent behavior was explained as this the most frequent application field for machine learning in sports.\n</li><li><b>Computer vision for sports</b>\nThe session aimed to expose the participants to the practice of gathering information about team sports through analysis of visual information.  The session began with an overview of the general practice of computer vision for sports.  Three of the presenters are from industry, representing companies with significant presence in the business of providing to analytics producers information on team sports such as basketball, football (soccer), and ice hockey.  The fourth presenter, from academia, discussed material on camera planning and analytics and in addition has himself been involved in tech transfer of visual analytics methods from amateur sports.  The overall goal, i.e., informing the participants regarding methods and applications of vision, was well met by the lectures of these experienced researchers.\n</li><li><b>Interdisciplinary view on tactics</b> The session aimed to build a common understanding of tactics and their implementation in predictive/generative models. It is still an open question how to represent overarching long-term strategies in computer models and different ideas were discussed on the example of overview and contributed presentations. \n\n</li><li><b>Explaining, interpreting, and visualizing models and data for sports</b> A key challenge is effectively conveying the results of machine learned models to domain experts, which is compounded by the black-box nature of many such models. This session highlighted a variety of techniques for meeting this objective, with illustrative examples arising from practice were shown for a variety of sports such as ice hockey, table tennis and football. This remains an active area of research and variety of lessons learned and ideas for improving the communication between domain-experts and technical-experts were discussed. \n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ulf Brefeld, Jesse Davis, Martin Lames, and Jim Little\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Logics for Dependence and Independence",
            "data": "\n <h3>Brief Introduction to the Topic</h3> \n <p>\nDependence and independence are interdisciplinary notions that are pervasive in many areas of science. They appear in domains  such as mathematics,  computer science, statistics, quantum physics, and game theory. The development of logical and semantical structures for these notions provides an opportunity for a systematic approach, which can expose surprising connections between different areas, and may lead to useful general results. \n</p> \n <p>\nDependence Logic is a tool for modeling dependencies and interaction in dynamical scenarios. Reflecting this, it has higher expressive power and complexity than classical logics used for these purposes previously. Algorithmically, first-order dependence logic corresponds exactly to the complexity class NP and to the so-called existential fragment of second-order logic. Since the introduction of dependence logic in 2007, the framework has been generalized, e.,g., to the contexts of modal, intuitionistic, and probabilistic logic. Moreover, interesting connections have been found to complexity theory, database theory, statistics, and dependence logic has been applied in areas such as linguistics, social choice theory, and physics. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the computational side of these formalisms, still many central questions remain unsolved so far. In addition to addressing the open questions, the seminar also aimed at boosting the exchange of ideas and techniques between  dependence logic and its application areas. \n</p> \n <h3>Organization of the Seminar and Activities</h3> \n <p>\nThe workshop brought together 40 researchers from mathematics, database theory, natural language semantics, and theoretical computer science. The participants consisted of both senior and junior researchers, including a number of postdocs and advanced graduate students.  \n</p> \n <p>\nParticipants were invited to present their work and to communicate state-of-the-art advances.  Over the five days of the workshop, 27 talks of various lengths took place. Introductory and tutorial talks of 90-60 minutes were scheduled prior to the workshop. Most of the remaining slots were filled, mostly with shorter talks, as the workshop commenced. The seminar ended with an open problems and perspectives session. The organizers considered it important to leave ample free time for discussion.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe tutorial talks were scheduled during the beginning of the week in order to establish a common background for the different communities that came together for the workshop. The presenters and topics were: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Miika Hannula: Team semantics \n</li><li> Val Tannen: Provenance\n</li><li> Dan Suciu: Probabilistic databases \n</li><li> Meghyn Bienvenu: Constraints in ontology based databases \n</li><li> David Pym: Resource semantics \n</li><li> Magdalena Ortiz: Complete and incomplete information in knowledge-enriched \ndatabases\n</li><li> Jef Wijsen: Database repairs\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn addition, the seminar consisted of 20 shorter contributed talks, addressing various topics concerning expressibility, axiomatizability, complexity and applications of team-based logics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe last session of the workshop was devoted to open problems and consisted of contributions by Phokion Kolaitis, Jouko V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen and Juha Kontinen presenting questions about decidability and axiomatizability of the implication problem of various fragments of dependence and independence logic, Joachim Biskup addressing decidable first-order prefix classes in the database context, Heribert Vollmer presenting open relationships among various counting classes related to team-based logics, Lauri Hella talking about union-closed properties in Sigma_1^1, and finally Raine R\u00f6nnholm addressing relationships between fragments of inclusion logic and greatest fixed-point logic.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe workshop ended with a discussion of future perspectives of the study of logics for dependence and independence. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe workshop  achieved its aim of bringing together researchers from various related communities to share state-of-the-art research. The organizers left ample time outside of this schedule of talks and many fruitful discussions between participants took place  throughout the afternoons and evenings. \n</p> \n <h3>Concluding Remarks and Future Plans</h3> \n <p>The organizers regard the workshop as a great success. Bringing together researchers from different areas fostered valuable interactions and led to fruitful discussions.  Feedback from the participants was very positive as well.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, the organizers wish to express their gratitude toward the Scientific Directorate of the Center for its support of this workshop.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Erich Gr\u00e4del, Phokion G.

            "title": "Programming Languages for Distributed Systems and Distributed Data Management",
            "data": "\n <p>\nDeveloping distributed systems is a well-known, decades-old problem in computer science. Despite significant research effort dedicated to this area, programming distributed systems remains challenging. The issues of consistency, concurrency, fault tolerance, as well as (asynchronous) remote communication among heterogeneous platforms naturally show up in this class of systems, creating a demand for proper language abstractions that enable developers to tackle such challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the last years, language abstractions have been a key for achieving the properties above in many industrially successful distributed systems. For example, MapReduce takes advantage of purity to parallelize task processing; complex event processing adopts declarative programming to express sophisticated event correlations; and Spark leverages functional programming for efficient fault recovery via lineage. In parallel, there have been notable advances in research on programming languages for distributed systems, such as conflict-free replicated data types, distributed information-flow security, language support for safe distribution of computations, as well as programming frameworks for mixed IoT/cloud development.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, the researchers that have been carrying out these efforts are scattered across different communities which include programming language design, type systems and theory, database systems and database theory, distributed systems, systems programming, data-centric programming, and web application development. This Dagstuhl Seminar brought together researchers from these different communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar focused on answering the following major questions: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Which abstractions are required in emergent fields of distributed systems, such as mixed cloud/edge computing and IoT?\n</li><li> How can language abstractions be designed in a way that they provide a high-level interface to programmers and still allow fine-grained tuning of low-level properties when needed, possibly in a gradual way?\n</li><li> Which compilation pipeline (e.g., which intermediate representation) is needed to address the (e.g., optimization) issues of distributed systems?\n</li><li> Which research issues must be solved to provide tools (e.g., debuggers, profilers) that are needed to support languages that target distributed systems?\n</li><li> Which security and privacy issues come up in the context of programming languages for distributed systems and how can they be addressed?\n</li><li> What benchmarks can be defined to compare language implementations for distributed systems?\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar accomplished the goal of bringing together the research communities of databases, distributed systems, and programming languages. The list of participants includes  24 academic and industrial researchers from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA, with complementary expertise and research interests. \nThe group had a balanced number of senior researchers and junior researchers, as well as a strong industrial representation.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe scientific program comprised 28 sessions. The sessions devoted to individual presentations included 16 short talks with a maximum duration of 15 minutes and 6 long contributed talks with a maximum duration of 35 minutes.\nIn addition, the seminar included 2 plenary sessions and 4 group sessions. \nThe first two days of the seminar were dedicated to research talks, but it was ensured that each talk had  \nallocated time for discussions and exchange of ideas. In the two following mornings there were 3 plenary sessions and 2 parallel group sessions.\nThe topics for these sessions were proposed and selected after a lively discussion between participants, \nwhere the most popular sessions were promoted to plenary and the remaining occurred in two parallel sessions.\nThe scientific sessions discussed and collected open questions on the topics of: programming models and abstractions; security and privacy; \nstatic guarantees, type systems, verification; distributed computing for the edge; time, synchrony, and consistency; and persistency and serialization. There was also a social topic discussing further actions to bring the three communities together. Even though there are overlapping research interests, there is a difference of values between communities that needs to be acknowledged and tackled.\nParticipants agreed on the goal of organizing follow-up events to further strengthen the connection\namong the database, the distributed systems and the programming languages communities. In particular, the importance of extending future events to Ph.D. students, for instance with an integrated Summer School, has been discussed.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Carla Ferreira, Philipp Haller,  and Guido Salvaneschi\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>For the analysis and representation of stationary signals and images the conventional Fourier- and wavelet-based methods are particularly appropriate. However, in many areas in science and engineering we are faced with the problem to interpret digital signals and images which are not band-limited and have a non-stationary behaviour. Frequently, there are even further obstacles. The acquisition of signal or image measurements may be very expensive and therefore limited. In other applications, measurement sets are huge but contaminated by noise. Examples of the above are encountered in magnetic resonance imaging, infrared microscopy, fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), the analysis of seismic signals in geophysics, radar imaging (SAR/ISAR), tissue ageing models, vibration analysis, direction of arrival (DOA) detection, texture classification, radio frequency identification (RFID), non-destructive testing, satellite navigation, time series analysis, echolocation, induction motor diagnostics (MCSA),  to name just a few.\n</p> \n <p>\nWithin the last few years, research on Prony-based methods has been intensified, as they offer an alternative to the compressed sensing approach. One essential advantage of the Prony method is that it does not need randomly collected measurements but works with deterministic sampling based on a sampling scheme which is adapted to the nonlinear signal model. At the same time, the Prony approach does not suffer the well-known curse of dimensionality in the multivariate case.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar brought together a number of researchers from different areas in mathematics, engineering and industry.\nTopics included new mathematical insights  and efficient numerical algorithms for problems based on exponential analysis  as well as applications of exponential analysis models in engineering and  life sciences.\nDuring this Seminar, the participants presented their newest results and discussed several open problems and applications from different perspectives.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe talks in the workshop partially had the character of survey talks and were arranged in different main research  topics, as  new mathematical theory (Day 1 and Day 5), new computational approaches  (Day 2) and new results in applications in engineering (Day 3) and life sciences (Day 4).  \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the first day, the talks focussed on the <b>mathematical theory of exponential analysis</b>.\nB. Beckermann and A. Matos emphasized \n the close connection between exponential analysis and rational approximation, which leads to new application areas as \ndensity reconstruction in an equilibrium problem in logarithmic potential theory and improved rational approximation  of Markov functions.\n As shown in the talk by T. Sauer, there is also a close connection between multi-exponential analysis and continued fractions. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the afternoon, the participants started four smaller <b>thematic discussion groups</b> to discuss new challenges and open problems throughout the week.\nThese discussion groups particularly focussed on theory, more efficient computational algorithms and applications in engineering and biosciences.\nThe discussions included general observations on the further development of exponential analysis and its ties to other subjects as well as further specific approaches for application of the theory to application problems in radar imaging or MRI.\nStill, we are far away from a full understanding of the relations between the different methods for the stable reconstruction of a parametric signal model, as well as from a systematic construction of Fourier analytic methods for the improved analysis of non-stationary signals.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn practice, Prony-based methods often suffer from a bad conditioning of the involved structured matrices and some extra effort is required to reliably execute the corresponding algorithms. Among the more successful implementations, the ESPRIT method, the Matrix-Pencil method, the approximate Prony method, and validated exponential analysis are established. The problem statement is also closely related to rational approximation theory and the structured low-rank approximation of structured matrices. These connections are still not completely understood and may lead to strongly improved reconstruction algorithms, able to treat more general sampling sets and deliver super-resolution results.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe second day was devoted to the problem of <b>efficient computations</b> for reconstruction or approximation of functions using multi-exponential analysis.\nFirst numerical methods like MUSIC are already implemented in the computer algebra system Maplesoft, as presented in the talk by J. Gerhard.\nThe advantage of the application of Maplesoft is that it can process the data within a desired very high precision and therefore successfully handle  these reconstruction problems which are known to be ill-conditioned.\nAnother way to improve the numerical stability is the application of more sophisticated numerical approaches to structured matrices and the connection to rational approximation, such that the existing stable algorithms for rational approximation can be used, see the talk of G. Plonka. The survey presentation  by H. Mhaskar  turned the attention to the application of neural networks to approximation problems, and D. Potts presented new efficient Fourier methods to compute the so-called ANOVA decomposition for approximation of multivariate functions.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the afternoon  a mini-course on newest features of Maplesoft was presented by J. Gerhard, with a special focus on the problem of how to connect MAPLESOFT with other Software as MATLAB etc.\nThe remaining time was used for further scientific  discussions in smaller groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the third day, the talks surveyed different new <b>applications of exponential analysis in engineering</b>.\nThe presentation of  F. Knaepkens showed new approaches for  direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, image denoising and inverse synthetic aperture radar.\nChromatic aberration in large antenna systems  have been studied by D. de Villiers. R.-M Weideman showed her results  on antenna position estimation through sub-sampled exponential analysis of signals in the near-field.\nThe talks by R. Beinert and J. Prestin showed applications concerning  phase retrieval in optical diffraction tomography and detection of directional jumps in images.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe survey presentations on the fourth day focussed on <b>exponential models in life sciences</b>.\nJ. Gielis  showed in his talk, how generalized M\u00f6bius-Listing bodies (GML)  can be employed for better  modelling and understanding of certain dynamical processes in the natural sciences.\nD. Li explained recent progress of advanced time-resolved imaging techniques  based on exponential analysis models and their applications in life sciences, for example to reveal biological processes at the molecular level. \nIn a further talk,  R.G. Spencer reported on newest developments in Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry and Macromolecular Mapping to achieve more accurate myelin quantification in the brain that  permits the establishment of physiological correlations. The underlying reconstruction problem is a seriously ill-posed inverse problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe last day of the workshop was again devoted to further results in  <b>mathematical theory of exponential analysis</b> and connections to other areas of mathematics.\nIn the talk by D. Batenkow, the degree of ill-posedness of the parameter reconstruction problem based on the exponential sum model was studied in more detail. The degree of condition of the problem  essentially  depends on the distribution of the frequency parameters.\nH. Vesolovska discussed the problem of recovering an atomic measure on the unit 2-sphere S\u00b2 given finitely many moments with respect to spherical harmonics.\nA connection  of exponential analysis to computer algebra problems was brought to our attention by M. Ishteva. She showed how the joint decomposition of  a set of non-homogeneous polynomials  can be computed using the canonical polyadic decomposition, and how this decomposition can be applied in nonlinear system identification.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl  meeting has been an important milestone for improved understanding of the large impact of exponential analysis tools in both theory and practice. During the thematic discussions in small groups in this meeting, several new aspects have been considered and several collaborations have been initiated or continued. Examples include new approaches for an improved modelling of antenna system frequency responses in radio frequency (Cuyt, De Villiers, Weideman) and for stabilised parameter estimation in exponential models using iterative factorizations of matrix pencils of Loewner matrices (Beckermann, Plonka-Hoch).\n</p> \n <p>\nWe mention that this seminar is related to Dagstuhl seminar 15251 on \u201cSparse modelling and multi-exponential analysis\u201e that took place in 2015. The discussions at the latter have led to many interesting collaborative projects, among which a funded Horizon-2020 RISE project (Research and Innovation Staff Exchange) with the acronym EXPOWER, standing for \u201cExponential analysis Empowering innovation\u201e (grant agreement No 101008231).  \n</p> \n <p>\nIt is our experience that these Dagstuhl seminars are timely and seminal. Through the meetings new collaborations and new potential are unlocked. There is a clear need to further connect stakeholders from the new theoretical developments and the identified industrial applications, as is our objective here and in the future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n</div> \n",

            "title": "Topology, Computation and Data Analysis",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar titled <em>Topology, Computation and Data Analysis</em> \nhas brought together researchers with mathematical and computational backgrounds in addressing emerging directions within computational topology for data analysis in practice. The seminar has contributed to the convergence between mathematical and computational thinking, in the development of mathematically rigorous theories and data-driven scalable algorithms. \n</p> \n <h3>Context</h3> \n <p>\nIn the last two decades, considerable effort has been made in a number of research communities into computational applications of topology. Inherently, topology abstracts functions and graphs into simpler forms, and this has an obvious attraction for data analysis. This attraction is redoubled in the era of extreme data, in which humans increasingly rely on tools that extract mathematically well-founded abstractions that the human can examine and reason about. In effect, topology is applied as a form of data compression or reduction: topology is one of the most powerful forms of mathematical compression that we know how to apply to data. \n</p> \n <p>\nEfforts to apply topology computationally to data, however, have largely been fragmented so far, with work progressing in a number of communities, principally computational topology, topological data analysis, and topological visualization. Of these, computational topology expands from computational geometry and algebraic topology to seek algorithmic approaches to topological problems, while topological data analysis and topological visualization seeks to apply topology to data analysis, of graphs and networks in the first case and of (usually) simulated volumetric data in the second. The research in these communities can roughly be clustered into theory (what are the underlying mathematical concepts), applications (how are they used for data analysis),\nand computation (how to compute abstractions for real datasets). It is crucial to advances in this area that these three branches go hand-in-hand, and communication between theoretical, applied, and computational researchers are therefore indispensable. On the other hand, there has been surprisingly little communication between the computational topology and topological visualization communities, mostly caused by the fact that each community has its own set of regular venues.  As a consequence, the linkages in the two communities have been independent of each other, and results can take years to migrate from one community to the other.\n</p> \n <h3>Vision</h3> \n <p>Our goal was therefore to soften the aforementioned rather strict separation \nbetween computational topology and topological visualization by establishing new inter-community ties. The seminar aimed to bring together cross sections of both communities, including researchers with theoretical, applied, and computational backgrounds.  By reducing redundancy and accelerating cross-communication, we expected a significant boost to both areas, perhaps even leading to a singular more dynamic community. As a side effect, we also wanted to provide a communication platform within each community between\ntheory and application.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>We identified specific research topics reflecting emerging trends in both communities. \nThese topics were chosen to span the spectrum from the theoretical (category theory), to applicable theory (multidimensional persistent homology), and from applied theory (singularity theory and fiber topology) to the computational (scalable topological computation, applications) aspect.\n</p> \n <p><b>Category theory: theory and applications.</b> Category theory has recently gained momentum in computational topology, in particular through sheaves and cosheaves, which are extremely useful as an alternative foundation for level set persistence. Recent work has shown that the data of a Reeb graph can be stored in a category-theoretic object called a cosheaf, and this opens the way to define a metric for Reeb graphs known as the interleaving distance. Sheaves can also be used in deriving theoretical understandings between the Reeb space and its discrete approximations. Research into sheaves and their relationship with computation is, however, in its infancy, and would benefit from pooling the resources of experts in category theory and topological data analysis, to address questions such as how to simplify theories in computational topology, how to reinterpret persistent homology, or how to compare topological structures.\n</p> \n <p><b>Multidimensional persistent homology.</b> The second area of active research, both mathematically and computationally, is the extension of unidimensional persistence to multidimensional persistence.\nMathematically, the lack of a complete discrete invariant for the multidimensional case raises the theoretical question of identifying meaningful topological invariants to compute. Some earlier proposals have been complemented by recent approaches and raise the immediate question of computability and applicability. Besides the invariants themselves, other questions such as the comparison of multidimensional data, or the efficient generation of cell complexes suitable for the multidimensional case are crucial, but hardly studied questions in this context. Computationally, existing algorithms for topological constructs rely on filtrations to encapsulate a sweep order through the data, thus serializing the problem for algorithmic implementation. For multidimensional data, this serialization is hard to achieve, and progress in this area is, therefore, crucial for computational advances in the topological analysis of data.\n</p> \n <p><b>Singularity theory and fiber topology in multivariate data analysis.</b> Singularity theory and fiber topology both seek to extend Morse theory from scalar fields to multivariate data described as functions mapping f: X to R^d. Since multivariate datasets are near-ubiquitous in scientific applications such as oceanography, astrophysics chemistry, meteorology, nuclear engineering and molecular dynamics, advances here are also crucial for topological data analysis and visualization. Methods from computational topology have been developed to support the analysis of scalar field data with widespread applicability. However, very few tools exist for studying multivariate data topologically: the most notable examples of these tools are the Jacobi set, the Reeb space, and its recent computational approximation, the Joint Contour Net.  Here, we aim to bring together researchers in singularity theory, fiber topology and topological data analysis to develop new theory and algorithms driving a new generation of analytic tools.\n</p> \n <p><b>Scalable computation.</b> At the opposite pole from theory is the practical question: how do we apply topological analysis to ever-larger data sets?  This question spans questions of algorithmic performance to the accuracy of representation: using the metaphor of compression, do we want lossy or lossless compression, how fast can we perform it, and what do we lose in the process?  Moreover, the largest data sets are necessarily computed and stored on clusters, and scalability of topological computation therefore also depends on building distributed and parallel algorithms. For example, the standard algorithm for computing persistent homology is cubic in the number of simplices, but can be speeded up in theory and practice, and further improved by parallel computation. However, many challenges remain, including efficient generation, storage and management of simplicial complexes, streaming computation, I/O efficient computation, approximate computation, and non-simplicial complexes. Some of these approaches have already been applied in topological visualization, and cross-fertilization between the two communities is therefore of great interest.\n</p> \n <h3>Participants, Schedule, and Organization</h3> \n <p>The invitees were chosen according to the topics, bringing together enough expertise for each topic and resulting in a representative\nsubset of both communities. Out of the 37 invited researchers in the first round, 28 accepted our invitation, pointing out the general\ninterest for the seminar topic in both communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe decided for a mixed setup with introductory talks, contributed research talks and breakout sessions.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor the first day, we scheduled two overview talks per listed topic, which were delivered by Steve Oudot and Elizabeth Munch (Category theory),\nMichael Lesnick and Claudia Landi (Multidimensional persistent homology), Osamu Saeki and Julien Tierny (Singularity theory),\nand Yusu Wang and Valerio Pascucci (Scalable Computation). Further contributed talks by participants took place from Tuesday to Friday morning,\nresulting in a total of 19 contributed talks. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe afternoons of Tuesday and Thursday were used for breakout sessions. The format was different on the two days. Based on the discussions\non Monday, we identified the topics \"multivariate topology\" and \"scalable computation\" as topics of general interest. We decided to let every participant discuss both topics, so we organized 4 discussion groups on multivariate topology in the early afternoon, and 3 discussion groups on scalable computation in the later afternoon (plus an alternative group with a different topic). We composed these groups mostly randomly, making sure that members of both communities are roughly balanced in each group. On Thursday afternoon, we let participants propose their topics of interest. 5 groups were formed discussing various aspects raised in contributed talks. On Wednesday and Friday morning, the outcomes of every discussion group were summarized and discussed in a plenary session.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, the majority of the participants joined an organized excursion to Trier on Wednesday afternoon.\n</p> \n <h3>Results and Reflection</h3> \n <p>The participants gave the unanimous feedback that the breakout sessions were a full success (and several proposed more time for such discussions\nin possible upcoming seminars). We first let people from a mixed background to discuss rather vague topics on Tuesday, and asked for specific topics on Thursday. Such an organizational plan led to a stimulating working environment, and helped to avoid idle breakout sessions. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe that we have fully achieved the goal of softening the separation between the two communities involved in this seminar.\nWe expect visible evidence of newly formed inter-community ties fostered by the seminar, for instance through joint research projects\nand/or survey articles summarizing major open problems on the interface of both communities. \nTo the best of our knowledge, 3 working groups are being formed and at least 1 position paper is underway that will combine expertise from both communities to tackle key  research questions raised during the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Hamish Carr, Michael Kerber, and Bei Wang\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "The Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Complexity and Approximability",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe <em>constraint satisfaction problem</em>, or CSP in short, provides a unifying framework in which it is possible to express, in a natural way, a wide variety of computational problems dealing with mappings and assignments, including satisfiability, graph colourability, and systems of equations. The CSP framework originated 30-35 years ago independently in artificial intelligence, database theory, and graph theory under three different guises, and it was realised only in the late 1990s that these are in fact different faces of the same fundamental problem. Nowadays, the CSP is extensively used in theoretical computer science, being a mathematical object with very rich structure that provides an excellent laboratory both for classification methods and for algorithmic techniques; while in AI and more applied areas of computer science, this framework is widely regarded as a versatile and efficient way of modelling and solving a variety of real-world problems, such as planning and scheduling, software verification, and natural language comprehension, to name just a few.\nAn instance of the CSP consists of a set of variables, a set of values for the\nvariables, and a set of constraints that restrict the combinations of values\nthat certain subsets of variables may take. Given such an instance, the possible\nquestions include (a) deciding whether there is an assignment of values to the\nvariables so that every constraint is satisfied, or optimising such assignments\nin various ways, or (b) finding an assignment satisfying as many constraints as\npossible. There are many important modifications and extensions of this basic\nframework, e.g., those that deal with counting assignments or involve soft or\nglobal constraints.\n</p> \n <p>\nConstraint satisfaction has always played a central role in computational\ncomplexity theory; appropriate versions of CSPs are classical complete problems\nfor most standard complexity classes. CSPs constitute a very rich and yet\nsufficiently manageable class of problems to give a good perspective on general\ncomputational phenomena. For instance, they help to understand which\nmathematical properties make a computational problem tractable (in a wide sense, e.g., polynomial-time solvable, non-trivially approximable, fixed-parameter tractable, or definable in a weak logic). One of the most striking features of this research direction is the variety of different branches of mathematics (including universal algebra and logic, combinatorics and graph theory, probability theory and mathematical programming) that are used to achieve deep insights in the study of the CSP. In the last decade, research activity in this area has significantly intensified and hugely impressive progress was made.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe recent flurry of activity on the topic of the seminar is witnessed by four\nprevious Dagstuhl seminars, titled \"Complexity of constraints\" (06401) and\n\"The CSP: complexity and approximability\" (09441, 12541, 15301), that were\nheld in 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015 respectively. This seminar was a follow-up to the 2009, 2012, and 2015 seminars. Indeed, the exchange of ideas at the 2009, 2012, and 2015 seminars has led to ambitious new research projects and to\nestablishing regular communication channels. There is clearly the potential for\nfurther systematic interaction that will keep on cross-fertilising the areas\nand opening new research directions. The 2018 seminar brought together 47\nresearchers from different highly advanced areas of constraint satisfaction and\ninvolved many specialists who use universal-algebraic, combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic techniques to study CSP-related algorithmic problems. The participants presented, in 24 talks, their recent results on a number of important questions concerning the topic of the seminar. One particular feature of this seminar is a significant increase in the number of talks involving multiple subareas and approaches within its research direction - a definite sign of the growing synergy, which is one of the main goals of this series of seminars.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Concluding remarks and future plans:</b> The seminar was well received as witnessed by the high rate of accepted\ninvitations and the great degree of involvement by the participants. Because of\na multitude of impressive results reported during the seminar and active\ndiscussions between researchers with different expertise areas, the organisers\nregard this seminar as a great success. With steadily increasing interactions\nbetween such researchers, we foresee another seminar focusing on the interplay\nbetween different approaches to studying the complexity and approximability of\nthe CSP. Finally, the organisers wish to express their gratitude to the\nScientific Directors of the Dagstuhl Centre for their support of the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Description of the Topics of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\n<b>Classical computational complexity of CSPs.</b> Despite the provable existence of intermediate problems (say, between P and NP-complete, assuming P =/ NP), research in computational complexity has produced a widely known informal thesis that \"natural problems are almost always complete for standard complexity classes\". CSPs have been actively used to support and refine this thesis. More precisely, several restricted forms of the CSP have been investigated in depth. One of the main types of restrictions is the <em>constraint language</em> restriction, i.e. a restriction on the available types of constraints. By choosing an appropriate constraint language, one can obtain many well-known computational problems from graph theory, logic, and algebra. The study of the constraint language restriction was driven by the CSP <em>Dichotomy Conjecture</em> of Feder and Vardi which states that,\nfor each fixed constraint language, the corresponding CSP is either in P or NP-complete. There are similar dichotomy conjectures concerning other complexity classes (e.g., L and NL). Recent breakthroughs in the complexity of the CSP have been made possible by the introduction of the universal-algebraic approach, which extracts algebraic structure from the constraint language\nand uses it to analyse problem instances. The above conjectures have algebraic versions which also predict in algebraic terms where the boundary between\nharder problems and easier problems lies. The algebraic approach has been applied to prove the Dichotomy Conjecture in many important special cases (e.g., Bulatov's dichotomy theorems for 3-valued and conservative CSPs), \nculminating in two independent proofs of the general conjecture announced in 2017 by Bulatov and Zhuk.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Bulatov and Zhuk gave detailed talks on the main insights into their proofs.\n</li><li>Kolmogorov described an algorithm for Boolean CSPs under the restriction that every variable appears in exactly two constraints and all constraints are even Delta-matroids. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe valued CSP (VCSP) is a significant generalisation of the CSP that involves both feasibility\nand optimisation aspects. While the computational complexity of finite-domain\nVCSPs is by now well understood, the infinite-domain VCSPs are fairly\nunexplored.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Viola gave a talk on submodular VCSPs on infinite domains.\n</li><li> Kazda presented his results on the structure of weighted clones, which are\nintimately related to the computational complexity of VCSPs.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Approximability of  CSPs.</b>\nThe use of approximation algorithms is\none of the most fruitful approaches to coping with NP-hardness.\nHard optimisation problems, however, exhibit diverse behavior\nwith respect to approximability, making it an exciting research area that is\nby now well-developed but far from fully understood.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn emerging topic bridging the complexity of the CSP with approximation aspects\nis <em>promise constraint satisfaction</em> (PCSP). The PCSP is a generalization of the CSP in which the constraints come in pairs of \"stricter\" and \"weaker\" versions. In a PCSP instance, the task is to find an assignment satisfying the weaker constraints under the promise that there is an assignment satisfying the strict constraints.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Brakensiek gave an introductory talk to this exciting research direction and also presented a dichotomy classification for symmetric Boolean PCSPs.\n</li><li>\nOprsal explained the very recently introduced algebraic approach to the\ncomputational complexity of PCSPs.\n</li><li>\nBarto presented his results on PCSPs and cyclic operations.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Many approximation algorithms for CSPs are based on convex relaxations.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Berkholz gave an overview on relaxations for Boolean CSPs based on algebraic\nmethods.\n</li><li>\nSchramm explained the power of semidefinite programming relaxations for random\nCSPs.\n</li><li>\nTulsiani presented results on the limits of linear programming relaxations for CSPs.\n</li><li>\nMakarychev showed how to obtain an integrality gap for the Calinescu-Karloff-Rabani linear\nprogramming relaxation of the Multiway-Cut problem.\n</li><li>\nAustrin established the currently best known inapproximability result for Min\nUnCut, which is a special Boolean CSP.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nSome of the most exciting developments in approximability in the last decade\nrevolve around the <em>unique games conjecture</em>, or UGC, of Khot (2002). This bold conjecture asserts that, for CSPs with a certain constraint language over a large enough domain, it is NP-hard to distinguish almost satisfiable instances from those where only a small fraction of constraints can be satisfied. This conjecture is known to imply tight inapproximability results for many classical optimisation problems. Moreover, if the UGC is true, then, as shown by Raghavendra in 2008, a simple algorithm based on semidefinite\nprogramming provides the best possible approximation for <em>all</em> CSPs (though the exact quality of this approximation is unknown).\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Moshkovitz presented recent developments on the so-called 2-to-2 PCP theorem, which covers important special cases of the UGC.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Logic and the complexity of CSPs.</b> Logic has been used in two distinct ways in the study of the CSP. One of them, starting from earlier work of Kolaitis and Vardi, is <em>descriptive complexity</em>, where one tries to classify CSPs as classes of instances with respect to definability in a given logic. The other way is to use logic to specify CSP instances, which can be done very naturally. The latter direction leads to generalisations such as the quantified CSP (QCSP), as well as to the study of CSPs over infinite domains, where important links with the algebraic approach were found. \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Roy presented a dichotomy theorem for the inverse satisfiability problem.\n</li><li>\nBodirsky gave a talk on two methods of reducing infinite-domain CSPs to\nfinite-domain CSPs.\n</li><li>\nPinsker explained recent results on the algebraic approach to infinite-domain\nCSPs. These results are related to the so-called loop conditions, which were in more detail discussed by Kozik.\n</li><li>\nKompatscher presented a proof of the equivalence of two dichotomy conjectures\nfor infinite-domain CSPs.\n</li><li>\nMottet gave a new proof of the dichotomy for MMSNP and discussed consequences\nfor infinite-domain CSPs.\n</li><li>\nMartin described recent results for temporal and spatial problems, which are\nspecial cases of infinite-domain CSPs.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Exact exponential complexity of CSPs.</b>\nThe area of parameterised complexity is closely related to the area of exact\nexponential complexity, in which the goal is to design the most efficient\nexponential-time algorithms. There has been significant progress on the exact\nexponential complexity of CSPs. \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Golovnev presented results that give optimal lower bounds on the running time of\nalgorithms for deciding if there is a homomorphism from one graph to another.\n</li><li>The complexity of counting solutions for CSPs and related problems from statistical physics were presented by Goldberg and Jerrum.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Grohe, Venkatesan Guruswami, D\u00e1niel Marx, and Stanislav \u017divn\u00fd\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Systems Security",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIn the light of the increasing digitization and move toward Industry 4.0 [1], cyber security becomes more and more important for cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The advanced computation, communication, and control capabilities of CPSs lead to a wider attack surface and greater exposure to security flaws. Furthermore, the added complexity puts a considerable burden on security professionals, who have to ensure that the CPSs are adequately protected against adversaries throughout the entire lifecycle. As a matter of fact, designing holistic security measures is a significant ongoing challenge for academia and industry alike. Thorough security testing during the engineering- and, particularly, the operation phase is often not feasible. The development of custom CPS testbeds is complicated, expensive, and time-consuming due to high hardware costs, space constraints,\nand complex dependencies between components [2]. Past attempts to conduct penetration tests directly on live systems led to unintended system behavior, putting human workers in significant danger and causing a disruption of production lines [3]. In addition to regular security testing, adequate countermeasures need to be implemented in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities that emerge during operation or if the CPS is already under\nattack. However, the steadily increasing sophistication of cyberattacks calls for more effective intrusion detection and prevention techniques. On top of that, new mechanisms to test and evaluate attack response strategies in a controlled setting are required.\n</p> \n <p>\nA digital twin, that is, a virtual replica of a real system, was originally envisioned for similar, yet non-security-related purposes: The life of a spacecraft is virtually mirrored through high-fidelity simulations and sensor updates to detect anomalies and safely test mitigation options such that degradation can be reduced and damages prevented [4]. This idea was picked up by the industrial informatics community, whose members implemented the digital-twin concept in various CPS applications for monitoring, lifecycle management,\nand decision support [5, 6, 7]. In the past few years, researchers have also shown interest in utilizing digital twins for security-enhancing purposes [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Although the definition of what constitutes a digital twin in the context of cybersecurity differs in the literature, its main application areas seem to be clear: Virtually replicated systems by means of emulation, simulation, and modeling technologies, coupled with real-time or historical data flows, might be used to improve security testing, intrusion detection, and attack recovery. However, fundamental research questions and challenges remain before digital twins can be applied for security-enhancing purposes. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the potential security threats associated with the digital-twin concept [14].\n</p> \n <p>Thus, the primary goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to lay the foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration on digital-twin research for CPS security. The interdisciplinary character of this novel research area is reflected in its origin. As already indicated, the notion of using \u201ctwins\u201d originally emerged from the space industry [6], gained wider adoption by the\nindustrial informatics community [5, 6, 7], and was eventually applied with the objective of attaining security improvements [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. For this reason, the seminar has brought together 20 researchers with backgrounds in computer security, control theory, automation engineering, and data science. Inspired by the concept\u2019s promised security improvement potential, the seminar was structured along three different themes:\n</p> \n <p><b>Foundations of Security-focused Digital Twins.</b> This theme was motivated by the lack of clarity around the digital-twin concept. Therefore, the purpose of this theme was to develop a common understanding of what a digital twin in the context of security is, how it can be defined, and how it relates to existing concepts, such as cyber ranges, data-driven models, and honeypots. Closely tied to this theme were discussions on methods for digitaltwin implementation, including (i) emulating systems and simulating physical processes, (ii) knowledge retrieval for digital-twin generation in greenfield and brownfield environments, and (iii) synchronizing digital twins with their physical counterparts.\n</p> \n <p><b>Intrusion Detection.</b> The objective of this theme was to explore intrusion detection as a potential use case for digital twins. Assuming that the digital twin is built from a benign specification such that legitimate behavior is exhibited when executed in sync with its counterpart, any deviations observed on the logic, network, and physics layers could indicate malicious activity. Building on this idea, participants discussed how digital twins can serve\nas a foundation for such behavior-specification-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that possess physics- and process-aware capabilities. Moreover, discussions touched on how digital twins can be used for data generation purposes to improve the training phase of (semi-)supervised learning approaches that are employed in behavior-based IDSs.\n</p> \n <p><b>Attack Response Mechanisms.</b> The last theme was associated with research questions on implementing proactive and reactive attack response strategies, which may represent another use case of digital twins. Proactive security measures can prevent cyber-physical attacks in the face of imminent threats when new vulnerabilities in the CPS are discovered. On the other hand, reactive responses to an attack can be initiated to control damage by ensuring\nthat the physical system maintains a safe state. In this context, questions were raised about how the digital-twin concept can help in designing attack-resilient CPS architectures and response strategies for control systems. This theme highlighted the benefits and challenges of using digital twins to test countermeasures in a simulated environment and assess their effects.\n</p> \n <p>The program started with a welcome session that provided an opportunity for participants\nto get to know one another. Furthermore, the organizers used this session to share information\nabout the seminar program and explain key terms to participants who were not au fait with\nthe terminologies used by different communities. Over the five days, 14 participants gave\nlightning talks that focused on the following topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>building blocks for digital-twin construction, including emulating and simulating CPS components, data-driven approaches and semantic technologies, synchronization mechanisms,\n</li><li>reverse engineering programmable logic controllers, deception technology (e.g., honeypots), security testbeds,\n</li><li>attack detection in CPSs, featuring physics-based, data-driven, and process-aware techniques,\n</li><li>attack-resilient control using different tools for risk mitigation (viz., prevention, detection, and treatment),\n</li><li>various aspects of dataset availability in CPS research (e.g., attack simulation, data collection, evaluation, and validation), and\n</li><li>digital-twin use cases for the safety-related system development lifecycle.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The lightning talk sessions offered each speaker 15 minutes to present new perspectives and talk about current challenges in CPS security. The highly interdisciplinary setting and stimulating presentations given by participants resulted in active discussions, which were carried on in the breakout sessions.\n</p> \n <p>The afternoons of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday were used for breakout sessions to give participants the opportunity to work together on research issues of common interest. Based on the discussions that took place on Monday after the session on bridging the disciplinary gap, we identified the following topics of interest to be explored by working groups: (i) conceptualization of the digital twin for cyber-physical systems security, and (ii) attack recovery for control systems. Participants who worked on the former topic discussed haracteristics that digital twins need to have to be useful for security applications, while those who focused on the latter topic investigated strategies in the context of control theory to respond to attacks in a reactive manner.\n</p> \n <p>The seminar received very positive feedback from participants, who also expressed strong interest in future editions. In addition, several invitees, who were forced to cancel their participation at short notice due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, have shown great interest in follow-up events. Thus, we believe that this Dagstuhl Seminar should be repeated in the future. A second edition would be worthwhile to investigate open problems concerning system emulation. These issues could be addressed in a future follow-up seminar if more\nparticipation from the embedded systems and systems security communities is achieved.\n</p> \n <p>As the organizers, we would like to thank everyone who attended this seminar for their interesting talks, the thought-provoking questions, and the fruitful contributions that led to a highly collaborative atmosphere for scientific discussions. We also would like to express our sincere gratitude to the scientific and administrative staff of Schloss Dagstuhl for their outstanding support that made this seminar possible.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Henning Kagermann, Johannes Helbig, Ariane Hellinger, and Wolfgang Wahlster.

            "title": "Logic and Learning",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nLogic and learning are central to Computer Science, and in particular to AI research and allied areas. Alan Turing envisioned, in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" [1], a combination of statistical (<em>ab initio</em>) machine learning and an \"unemotional\" symbolic language such as logic. However, currently, the interaction between research in logic and research in learning is far too limited; in fact, they are often perceived as being completely distinct or even opposing approaches. \n</p> \n <p>\nWhile there has been interest in using machine learning methods within many application areas of logic, the investigation of these interactions has usually been carried out within the confines of a single problem area. We believe that an interaction involving a broader perspective is needed. It would be fruitful to look for common techniques in applying learning to logic-related tasks, which requires looking across a wide spectrum of applications. It is also important to consider the ways that logic and learning, deduction and induction, can work together.\n</p> \n <h3>Design of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nThe main aim of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to address the above problems by bring researchers from the logic and learning communities together and to create bridges between the two fields via the exchange of ideas ranging between the (seemingly) polar possibilities of the injection of declarative methods in machine learning and the use and applications of learning technologies in logical contexts. This included creating an understanding of the work in different applications, an increased understanding of the formal connections between these applications, and the development of a more unified view of the current attempts to organically reconcile deductive and inductive approaches. In order to structure these explorations, the focal points of the seminar were the following three distinct strands of interaction between logic and learning:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><em>Machine Learning for Logic</em>, including the learning of logical artifacts, such as formulas, logic programs, database queries and integrity constraints, as well as the application of learning to tune deductive systems.\n\n</li><li><em>Logic for Machine Learning</em>, including the role of logics in delineating the boundary between tractable and intractable learning problems, the construction of formalisms that allow learning systems to take advantage of specified logical rules, and the use of logic as a declarative framework for expressing machine learning constructs.\n\n</li><li> <em>Logic vs. Machine Learning</em>, including the study of problems that can be solved using either logic-based techniques or via machine learning, an exploration of the trade-offs between these techniques, and the development of benchmarks for comparing these methods.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Summary of seminar activities</h3> \n <p>The seminar was attended by 41 researchers across various communities including logic, databases, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), formal verification, machine learning, deep learning, and theorem proving. The membership consisted of senior and junior researchers, including graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and industry experts. The seminar was conducted through talks and breakout sessions, with breaks for discussion between the attendees. There were three long talks, 21 short talks, and three breakout sessions on the discussion of open problems in logic and learning. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe talks consisted of: (i) presentation of recent advances in research questions and methodologies relating to the motivations discussed above; (ii) surveys of the state of research on various problems requiring the combination of deductive and inductive reasoning as well as methodologies developed to address fundamental hurdles in this space; (iii) new perspectives on the organic combination of logical formulations and methods with machine learning in specific application domains; (iv) theoretical formulations and results on problems in learning logical representations; (v) demonstrations of state-of-the art tools combining logic and learning for applications such as theorem proving or entity resolution; (vi) presentation of research on challenge problems for the field of AI and intelligent reasoning. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe breakout sessions were conducted in three continuing parts, each spanning one session. The first part involved all the participants in a discussion of the current (small and large) open problems in AI, challenge problems for the field of intelligent systems, and research questions about defining specific goals representing a successful combination of inductive and deductive reasoning. This involved a deliberation of what problems were relevant, which problems could be potentially related to or dependent upon each other, and various suggestions to formalise commonly desired research goals. This session resulted in the choice of three broad areas for further specific discussion: (i) Explainable AI (ii) Injecting symbolic knowledge or constraints into neural networks, and (iii) Learning of logical formulae (first-order logic) from satisfaction on structures in a differentiable manner. The second part consisted of parallel thematic sessions on these three areas. Each thematic session was conducted in the form of a round-table discussion and was led by one or two participants who championed the theme. The third session brought all the participants together again to conclude with a summary of the ideas exchanged during the parallel sessions.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusion</h3> \n <p>We consider the seminar a success. There is a growing need to enable the disparate communities of logic and learning to interact with each other, and we noted from the seminar that researchers from each community appreciated the perspective offered by the other, often identified techniques used by the other community that could be imported into their own, and, interestingly, were in agreement about the relevant and important problems of the day. The format of the seminar including ample time for discussions and breakout sessions received positive feedback from the participants.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>A. M.

            "title": "Sparsity in Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Logic",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nIt was realized already in the early days of computer science that structures (networks, databases, etc.) that are sparse appear ubiquitously in applications. The sparsity of input can be used in a variety of ways, e.g. to design efficient algorithms. This motivates a theoretical study of the abilities and limitations of sparsity-based methods. However, a priori it is not clear how to even define sparsity formally. Multiple sparsity-oriented paradigms have been studied in the literature, e.g. bounded maximum or average degree models, topologically constrained classes of graphs or graphs with bounded width parameters. However, many of those paradigms suffer from being either too restrictive to model real-life applications, or too general to yield strong tractability results.\n</p> \n <p>In the late 2000\u2019s, Ne\u00b9et\u00f8il and Ossona de Mendez proposed a new framework of uniform structural sparsity for classes of graphs that generalized existing definitions and initiated the development of a toolbox of sparsity-based methods for analyzing graphs. The central notions of their framework are bounded expansion and nowhere dense classes. It quickly turned out that the proposed notions can be used to build a mathematical theory of sparse graphs that offers a wealth of tools, leading to new techniques and powerful results. This theory has been extensively developed in the recent years.\n</p> \n <p>It is particularly remarkable that the concepts of classes of bounded expansion and nowhere dense classes can be connected to fundamental ideas from multiple other fields of computer science, often in a surprising way, providing several complementary viewpoints on the subject. On one hand, foundations of the area are grounded in structural graph theory, which aims at describing structure in graphs through various decompositions and auxiliary parameters. On the other hand, nowhere denseness seems to delimit the border of algorithmic tractability of first-order logic, providing a link to finite model theory and its computational aspects. Finally, there is a fruitful transfer of ideas to and from the field of algorithm design: sparsity-based methods can be used to design new, efficient algorithms, especially in the paradigms of parameterized complexity, approximation algorithms, and distributed computing. Further, classic techniques for designing algorithms on sparse inputs inspire new combinatorial results on sparse graphs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to bring together researchers working on various aspects of sparsity in their own fields, in order to facilitate the exchange of ideas, methods and questions between different communities. So far, the synergy effect between graph theory, logic, and algorithm design has led to fundamental developments in the theory of sparse graph classes. Our goal is to inspire a new wave of developments by \"stirring in the pot\" of researchers working on different facets of sparsity. An important part of the seminar will be the discussion of the (still fledgling) area of real-life applications of sparsity-based methods, where theory and practice could meet.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar organization</h3> \n <p>\nDue to the on-going COVID pandemic, the seminar was held in hybrid format. \nIn total the seminar was attended by 61 participants around the world (from North America to Europe to Asia). 32 of the participants were on-site and 29 remote. To make the hybrid \nformat a success and in particular allow all members\nto participate in talks and working groups, the following measures were taken. \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>To accommodate both on-site and remote participants, a mix of on-site and remote talks were scheduled. The talks were scheduled in the early to late afternoon (MEZ local time), allowing remote audience members from all parts of the world to attend. \n</li><li> Both on-site and remote talks were streamed via zoom. The zoom session \nwas projected onto a whiteboard in the seminar room. The remote participants could see and hear the on-site whiteboard and slide presentations. They could \ninterrupt and ask questions or ask questions in the chat, which were then read by the organizers. This turned out to be a quite successful setup in which \nall participants could discuss in real-time. \n</li><li> On the first day of the seminar we had a short introduction of all participants, one invited tutorial lecture, one contributed talk and the open problem session. In total, we had 5~tutorial lectures and 12 contributed talks spread over the week. The topics and speakers were chosen to create a joint understanding of the state of the art in the fields that were brought together in the seminar. \n</li><li> The remaining program put a strong emphasis on open time for ad-hoc discussions and working in groups. After the open problem session on Monday, several groups of on-site and remote participants were formed, who approached the posed problems. \n</li><li> A discord server was set up to coordinate further communication and to keep track of the progress of the working groups. \n</li><li> A social event was organized online on Tuesday evening. \n</li></ol> \n <h3>Work on open problems</h3> \n <p>Following the open problem session on the first day of the workshop, spontaneous groups working on selected open problems emerged. These typically included a mix of on-site and online participants, working in either synchronous or asynchronous manner using the Discord platform as a mean of communication. Below we list a selection of directions that were pursued during the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Model-checking on interpretations of locally well-behaved structures.</b> It is known that model-checking First Order logic (FO) can be done in fixed-parameter time on classes of graphs that are locally well-behaved, for instance have locally bounded treewidth. However, the question is whether this is still true if the input graph is ``logically disguised'', or more precisely, has been additionally mapped through some FO transduction. The aim of this research group was to provide an affirmative answer by proving the following theorem: For every class of graphs ${mathscr C}$ that is stable and can be transduced from a class of locally bounded cliquewidth, the model-checking problems for FO is fixed-parameter tractable on ${mathscr C}$. This would generalize several known results on efficient FO model-checking on classes of dense graphs, e.g. map graphs or interpretations of classes of bounded degree, as well as provide multiple new results.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Transducing paths from classes of unbounded shrubdepth.</b> The emerging logically-motivated structure theory for graphs uses First-Order transductions as the main notion of embedding. It is important to understand possible duality theorems for this notion, of the following form: If a class of graphs  C does not admit a decomposition of some form, then  C transduces a class of specific obstacles witnessing this conclusion. The aim of this research group was to prove the most basic conjecture following this pattern: If a class of graphs  C has unbounded shrubdepth, then C transduces the class of all paths.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Treedepth vs pathwidth.</b> It is known that every graph of pathwidth Omega(ab) has treewidth at least a or contains a binary tree of depth $b$ as a minor. It is also known that every graph of treedepth Omega(abc) has treewidth at least a, or contains a binary tree of depth b as a minor, or contains a simple path of length 2^c. This suggests the following conjecture: every graph of treedepth Omega(bc) has either pathwidth at least b or contains a simple path of length 2^c. The aim of this research group was to resolve this conjecture.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>{Treewidth-twin-width.</b> The definition of the recently introduced graph parameter twin-width revolves around the mechanism of contraction sequences: simplification operations using which one can \"fold\" the whole graph into a single vertex. The main complexity measure of a contraction sequence is the maximum number of error edges that are adjacent to any vertex at any time. The goal of this group was to investigate the combinatorial properties of a graph parameter dubbed <em>treewidth-twin-width</em> obtained by additionally requiring that at all times, the graph composed of the error edges has bounded treewidth. Of particular interest is whether various classes known to have bounded twin-width actually have bounded treewidth-twin-width.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Integer programs equivalent to ones with bounded primal treedepth.</b> Integer programming is known to be efficiently solvable for instances with small primal or dual treedepth. While we have a relatively good understanding of conditions when the instance can be transformed to an instance with small dual treedepth, less is known in the case of primal treedepth. The aim of this research group was to relate, for a given instance of integer programming, the smallest possible primal treedepth of an equivalent instance to invariant properties of the instance itself, in particular, to the structure of the column matroid of the constraint matrix. The ultimate goal would be to design algorithms for constructing an equivalent instance with small primal treedepth while avoiding a blow up in the entry complexity (such a blow up would prevent using the existing IP algorithms to solve the constructed instance).\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>Schloss Dagstuhl provided an excellent environment for hosting \nthe seminar. The seminar room was appropriate to host the on-site participants and we found plenty of room for continuing discussions and socializing outside of the official program. This is particularly remarkable in these difficult times with the ongoing COVID pandemic. All participants were eager to meet and research together. According to the conducted survey, as well as\nthe informal feedback to the organizers, the seminar was highly appreciated and can be considered a full success. On behalf of all participants, the organizers want to express their gratitude to the entire Dagstuhl staff and their outstanding support and service throughout the seminar. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Daniel Kr\u00e1l', Michal Pilipczuk, Sebastian Siebertz, and Blair D.

            "title": "Algorithmic Foundations of Programmable Matter",
            "data": "\n <p>\nProgrammable matter refers to a substance that has the ability to change its\nphysical properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties,\netc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing.\nThe potential applications are endless, e.g., smart materials, autonomous\nmonitoring and repair, or minimal invasive surgery. Thus, there is a high\nrelevance of this topic to industry and society in general, and much research\nhas been invested in the past decade to fabricate programmable matter.\nHowever, fabrication is only part of the story: without a proper\nunderstanding of how to program that matter, complex tasks such as minimal\ninvasive surgery will be out of reach. Unfortunately, only very few people in\nthe algorithms community have worked on programmable matter so far, so\nprogrammable matter has not received the attention it deserves given the\nimportance of that topic.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar \"Algorithmic Foundations of Programmable Matter\" aimed at\nresolving that problem by getting together a critical mass of people from\nalgorithms with a selection of experts from distributed systems and robotics\nin order to discuss and develop models, algorithms, and technical solutions\nfor programmable matter.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of the proposed seminar was to bring together researchers from the algorithms community with selected experts from robotics and distributed systems in order to set a solid base for the development of models, technical solutions, and algorithms that can control programmable matter. The overall mix worked quite well: researchers from the more practical side (such as Julien Bourgeois, Nikolaus Correll, Ted Pavlic, Kay R\u00f6mer, among others) interacted well with participants from the theoretical side (e.g., Jennifer Welch, Andrea Richa, Christian Scheideler, S\u00e1ndor Fekete, and many others). Particularly interesting to see were well-developed but still expanding areas, such as tile self-assembly that already combines theory and practice (with visible and well-connected scientists such as Damien Woods, Matt Patitz, David Doty, Andrew Winslow, Robert Schweller) or multi-robot systems (Julien Bourgeois, Nikolaus Correll, Matteo Lasagni, Andr\u00e9 Naz, Beno\u00eet Piranda, Kay R\u00f6mer).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar program started with a set of four tutorial talks given by representatives from the different sets of participants to establish a common ground for discussion. From the robotics and distributed system side, Nikolaus Correll and Julien Bourgeois gave tutorials on smart programmable materials and on the claytronics programmable matter framework respectively. From the bioengineering side, Ted Pavlic gave a tutorial on natural systems that may inspire programmable matter. From the algorithmic side, Jacob Hendricks gave a tutorial on algorithmic self-assembly. In the mornings of the remaining four days, selected participants\noffered shorter presentations with a special focus on experience from the past work and especially also open problems and challenges. Two of the afternoons were devoted to discussions in breakout groups. Four breakout groups were formed, each with less than 10 participants to allow for intense interaction. Inspired by a classification of research questions in biology into \"why?\" and \"how?\" questions presented in Ted Pavlic's tutorial, the first breakout session was devoted to the \"why?\" questions underpinning programmable matter, especially also appropriate models of programmable matter systems (both biological or engineered) suitable for\nalgorithmic research. The second breakout sessions towards the end of the seminar was devoted to a set of specific questions given by the organizers that resulted from the discussions among the participants, they included both research questions and organizational questions (e.g., how to proceed after the Dagstuhl seminar). After each of the two breakout sessions, one participant of each of the four breakout groups reported back the main findings of the discussions to the\nplenum, leading to further discussion among all participants. One of the afternoons was devoted to a hike to a nearby village, where the participants also visited a small museum devoted to programmable mechanical musical devices.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was an overwhelming success. In particular, bringing together participants from a number of different but partially overlapping areas, in order to exchange problems and challenges on a newly developing field turned out to be excellent for the setting of Dagstuhl - and the opportunities provided at Dagstuhl are perfect for starting a new community.\n</p> \n <p>Participants were enthusiastic on a number of different levels:\n\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Meeting experts from other fields provided additional insights, challenges and focus when considering work on programmable matter.\n</li><li> Interacting with colleagues in a close and social manner gave many starting points for continuing collaboration.\n</li><li> Getting together in a strong, large and enthusiastic group provided the opportunity to plan a number of followup activities.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The latter include connecting participants via a mailing list, the planning and writing of survey articles in highly visible publication outlets, and a starting point for specific scientific workshops and conferences.\n</p> \n <p>\nParticipants were highly enthusiastic about the possibility of another Dagstuhl workshop in the future; organizers will keep the ball rolling on this - most likely, for an application in the coming spring, so that some more details can be worked out in the meantime.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    S\u00e1ndor Fekete, Andr\u00e9a Richa, Kay R\u00f6mer, and Christian Scheideler\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Ensuring the Reliability and Robustness of Database Management Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nDataBase Management Systems (DBMSs) are used ubiquitously. Due to the ever-growing number and size of data sets, increasing performance demands, and the virtually unlimited hardware resources that are provided by public cloud infrastructure,  sophisticated systems and optimizations are developed continuously. This dynamic and demanding environment is a major challenge for developers of DBMSs, which have to ensure that their systems are both correct and efficient.\n</p> \n <p>\nDatabase management systems are a well-established field with several decades of research and engineering attention. These\nefforts have resulted in a multitude of both open-source and commercial systems that are widely deployed in production today\nand provide the backbone of a vast range of mission-critical applications. Still, surprisingly, recent work on automatic testing of DBMSs found a large number of bugs in widely-used DBMSs. This clearly indicated that the topic of ensuring the reliability and robustness of DBMS deserves more attention, and that key insights from neighboring domains such as automatic testing and formal methods could potentially help to advance the state of the art in DBMS engineering.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals and Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nOne of the central goals and outcomes of the seminar was to build a common foundation and understanding for the key challenges of DBMS engineering, and how they can be potentially addressed. To this end, the seminar focused on\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Best practices and challenges in building open source and commercial database engines.<br/>\n   Here, the key objectives include a high developer efficiency, mandating quick feedback by tests and verification tools already during feature development, as well as systematic (stress) testing of the software under high load and error conditions.\n</li><li> The applicability of formal methods and verification tools to DBMS.<br/>\n   Formal methods can be of great help to prove the correctness of key database system components such as query compilers, distributed consensus protocols, data replication components, or modules dealing with high availability. Still, an important question is how to systematically identify those components that can benefit from formal verification with reasonable implementation effort, and how to best integrate these methods into existing systems.\n</li><li> Advanced testing techniques such as fuzzers, query synthesis, and workload generators.<br/>\n  These methods allow to significantly increase the test coverage of a DBMS by systematically exploring uncovered code paths and putting stress on individual, important subsystems such as input verification and error handling that are a frequent source of software defects.\n</li><li> Methods for the automatic generation of test data and testcase reduction.<br/>\n   Occasionally, defects in database software are only found by customers running very complex queries operating on confidential data sets. Thus, to allow for problem reproduction, developers benefit from a minimal data set and a simplified query specification that does not disclose confidential data or exhibit unnecessary complexity.\n</li><li> Security aspects such as ensuring confidentiality and data integrity in the presence of different classes of attackers.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Attendee Mix and Seminar Structure</h3> \n <p>The seminar lasted 2.5 days. Its format and attendee mix was significantly influenced by the ongoing pandemic. Of the 34 attendees, 13 attended in person and 21 remotely. All but one of the in-person attendees were based in Europe. Overall, we received the highest response rate from Europe (20 attendees), and a lower one from Asia (8 attendees) and the US (6 attendees). We are grateful to the two Video Conference Assistants (VCAs), Jack Clark and Mark Raasveldt, who managed the equipment to ensure a smooth experience for all attendees.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe started the seminar with an introduction round in which every attendee introduced themselves. We held another such session in the late afternoon, to accommodate the US attendees. Prior to the seminar, we contacted attendees to give overview talks to establish a common discussion basis, which was useful given that the attendees came from different scientific communities. We had such overview talks on the first and second day. On the second and third day, we had in-depth talks. While we had planned breakout sessions, many of the talks were followed by fruitful and unplanned discussions. On the last day, we had a group discussion on the takeaways and future plans.\n</p> \n <h3>Future Plans</h3> \n <p>One major result from the seminar was to identify open problems and areas of future work that the group wants to address in an interdisciplinary manner. Among others, this includes the creation of a reference manual for database engineering groups to avoid redundant work and re-inventing techniques already established (or discarded) by other teams, the identification of database modules (e.g. the query compiler and transaction processing system) that can benefit from formal verification, designing new test oracles to test various data-centric systems for different kind of bugs, as well as the establishment of a common testcase specification format and a test corpus that can be shared between DBMS engineering teams. We discussed proposing another instance of the Dagstuhl seminar to utilize the established discussion basis and work on addressing these specific challenges.\n\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Maria Christakis, Alexander B\u00f6hm, Eric Lo, and Manuel Rigger\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Bringing CP, SAT and SMT together: Next Challenges in Constraint Solving",
            "data": "\n <p>\n<b>The scattered landscape of constraint solving.</b>  Constraint solving is at the heart of several key technologies, including program analysis, testing, formal methods, compilers, security analysis, optimization, and AI. During the last two decades, constraint solving has been highly successful and transformative: on the one hand, SAT/SMT solvers have seen a significant performance improvement with a concomitant impact on software engineering, formal methods and security; on the other hand, CP solvers have also seen a dramatic performance improvement, with deep impact in AI and optimization.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThese successes bring new applications together and new challenges: some fundamental constraints still lack efficient reasoning (e.g., floating-point arithmetic); quantifiers are rarely taken into account; current approaches focus essentially on satisfiability and/or validity  while some applications would benefit from queries such as optimization or model counting. While each of the SAT, SMT and CP communities has made progress on some of these problems, no approach is able to tackle them all. \nMoreover, while historically strongly connected, the SAT/SMT communities have had minimal interactions with the CP community  over the recent years.   \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Goals.</b> The aim of this seminar was to reunify the Constraint Solving landscape and identify the next big challenges together with promising approaches. \nThe seminar brought together researchers from SAT, SMT and CP along with applications researchers in order to foster cross-fertilization of ideas, deepen interactions, identify the best ways to serve the application fields and in turn help improve the solvers for specific usages.\n</p> \n <h3>An overview of constraint solving.</h3> \n <ul>\n<li><b>CP.</b> <i>Constraint Programming</i> [1] focuses on finding a solution (satisfiability) or a best solution (optimization) to constraint problems seen as sets of atomic constraints over arbitrary domains. Traditionally, CP is interested in problems defined over finite-domain variables (typically: bounded integers), yet a lot of work has also been devoted to infinite domains such as real numbers. The basic scheme of CP approaches (in the finite setting)\nconsists in exploring the search tree of all partial valuations of the problem until a solution is found, or all possible valuations have been explored. At each step, propagation allows to refine further the admissible values for yet-unlabeled variables and, once no more propagation is possible, labeling assigns a value to a yet-unlabeled variable (yielding a backtrack point) and then propagation takes place against this, etc. CP has been highly successful in AI-related domains such as planning or scheduling, and promising applications to program verification have emerged recently.<br/>\n<i>Strong points: advance propagation techniques based on the key notion of arc-consistency; specific reasoning, especially for finite-domain theories (e.g. floats, bounded arithmetic, bitvectors); queries beyond satisfiability, e.g. optimization</i>\n</li><li><b>SAT.</b> While the seminal DPLL procedure [3] follows mostly the procedure described above for CP but specialized to the Boolean case1, the true miracle of SAT comes from its modern version [2], where conflict-driven learning allows significant driven-by-need pruning of the search space\u2014making the technique equally good at finding solutions or proving there is none. Many more improvements have been explored over the years, with carefully tuned propagation, data structures and branching heuristics. DPLL-style SAT solvers are at the core of hardware design and verification tools, and they have shown\nunreasonable efficiency on very large industrial problems.<br/>\n<i>Strong points: conflict-driven clause learning methods; efficient search/propagate procedure, with optimized branching and look-ahead.\n</i>\n</li><li><b>SMT.</b> Satisfiability Modulo Theory [4] extends SAT by considering the satisfiability problem over combinations of first-order theories, for examples formulas involving complex boolean structure plus uninterpreted functions, arrays and linear arithmetics. While first restricted to the unquantified case, the technique has been extended with partial support for quantifiers. The core of SMT techniques is the combination of efficient theory-dedicated conjunctive-only decision procedures (typically through the Nelson-Oppen  combination\nframework) together with their lifting to the general (disjunctive) case thanks to the DPLL(T) framework, where a DPLL-style SAT solver works in interplay with theory solvers. SMT problems arise naturally in software analysis, where programs are built over combinations of basic data types. Hence, SMT solvers are naturally at the heart of most modern software verification technologies.<br/>\n<i>Strong points: first-order decision procedures, including theories over infinite domains; elegant combinations of solvers; partial handling of quantifiers.</i>\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Research Questions.</b> The seminar allows to highlight several key challenges to current constraint solving techniques. They have been discussed during the meeting from different research perspectives.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Hard-to-handle data types: several common data types and\n  associated theories are still not managed in an efficient-enough\n  way, typically finite-but-large domains such as modular arithmetic,\n  bounded arithmetic with non-linear operations, floating-point\n  arithmetic or bitvector constraints deeply mixing arithmetic and\n  bit-level reasoning, sets with cardinality, strings with size, etc.\n\n</li><li>Quantifiers: quantifiers can be added to SMT solvers but often\n  at the price of losing model generation, while there is some support\n  for finite quantification in SAT and CP but at the price of a\n  significant drop in performance; yet, quantifiers are useful in\n  practice (initial state, pre/post-conditions, summaries, etc.);\n</li><li>Beyond satisfiability: while the first applications of\n  constraint solving were concerned with finding solutions or proving\n  validity / infeasibility, new applications bring new types of\n  queries, such a optimization, soft constraints, solution counting,\n  over-approximating sets of solutions, etc.\n\n</li><li> New trade-offs between learning and propagation: while the SAT community seems to have reached a sweet spot on this question (with efforts put on a posteriori learning rather than on a priori propagation),  the issue is not settled yet for SMT and CP, and may be theory and/or application dependent.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Potential Synergies.</b> We have also  identified the following potential synergies between CP, SAT and SMT, and expect strong interactions around these points in a near future:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>CP researchers have advanced propagation techniques, domain-dedicated reasoning and (deep) constraint combination. SAT and SMT researchers can learn from that.\n\n</li><li>  SAT researchers have significantly advanced branching heuristics, look-ahead  and conflict-clause learning methods. CP and SMT  researchers can learn from that.\n</li><li> SMT researchers have focused on theory solvers and well-defined solver combinations. How can we do ``lightweight'' theory integration in SAT/CP solvers that trade off generality for cheaper and focused implementation of theories aimed at very specific applications? SAT and CP researchers can take advantage of these points. \n</li><li> How can we better serve the needs of applications researchers?  Application researchers can tell solver designers about which of these features (and combinations thereof) they would like the most in a single solver. \n</li><li> Finally, an important question is how do we leverage machine\n  learning in these contexts.  The experience of the SAT community may\n  bring here some answers.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Outcome.</b> The main goal of this Dagstuhl seminar was to bring together leading researchers in the different subfields of automated reasoning and constraint solving, foster greater communication between these communities and discuss new research directions. \n</p> \n <p>The seminar had 28 participants from Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Finland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States, from both academia, research laboratories and the industry. More importantly, the participants represented several different communities, with the topics of the talks and discussions reflecting these diverse interests in both solving technologies (CP, SAT, SMT), challenges (floating-point constraints,\nquantifiers, etc.) and application domains (testing, verification, security, compilation,\ncommercialization, among others).\n</p> \n <p>\nIt was the first time such an inclusive meeting was held, bringing together leading researchers from SAT/SMT (typical interest: formal verification), CP (typical interest: optimization) and applications (typical interest: testing, verification, security). All participants agreed the event was fruitful, and we expect to see more collaborations between SAT/SMT and CP in a near future.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>R.

            "title": "Autonomous Agents on the Web",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe vision of autonomous agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself: in his keynote at <span title=\"The First International Conference on the World-Wide Web, CERN, 25-27 May 1994.\">WWW'94</span>, <span title=\"Sir Tim Berners-Lee, The Future of the Web, WWW'94: https://videos.cern.ch/record/2671957,\naccessed: 07.05.2021.\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee was noting that documents on the Web describe real objects and relationships among them, and if the semantics of these objects are represented explicitly then machines can browse through and manipulate reality.</span> These ideas were published under the Semantic Web vision in 2001 [1]. Yet in 2007, after having spent the better half of a decade advancing this vision, James Hendler was looking back to conclude that most ideas in the original article were already seeing widespread deployment on the\nWeb except for agent-based systems \u2013 and raised the question: \u201cwhere are all the intelligent agents?\u201d [2].\n</p> \n <p>\nThis question is yet to be addressed. On today's Web, we as human agents are often assisted by invisible software agents, such as crawlers used by search engines to navigate and index Web pages, agents that curate online content produced by people (e.g., Wikipedia's content agents), and recommender systems used all over the Web to generate more links and navigation paths (e.g., suggestions of related Web pages). In our everyday lives, we are assisted by more visible agents, such as Amazon's Alexa, Google Duplex, or Apple's Siri.\nSome of these agents may already use various AI methods (learning, reasoning, etc.), but they are specialized for narrow tasks and constrained to silos dictated by company ecosystems. We have yet to see more autonomous, cooperative, and long-lived agents on the Web [3] \u2013 the intelligent agents in James Hendler's question. We believe this decade-old question is now more relevant than ever before in the context of recent developments in three areas of research: (i)<em>Web Architecture and the Web of Things</em>, (ii)<em> Semantic Web and Linked Data</em>, and (iii) <em>Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems</em>.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe primary objective of this 5-day seminar was to create a network of senior and young researchers who can revisit and align the relevant research threads across the three targeted areas. The seminar was a blend of invited talks, live demonstrators, and group work. Some of the overarching research questions discussed during the seminar included (not an exhaustive list): How to design software agents able to achieve their tasks through flexible autonomous\nuse of hypermedia? How to design hypermedia-based environments that support autonomous behavior? How to design, represent, and reason about interactions among autonomous agents, people, and any other resources on the Web? How to design and govern communities of autonomous agents and people on the Web?\n</p> \n <p>\nA number of follow-up steps were already taken to continue the discussions and to further consolidate the community. <span title=\"https://purl.org/atac/2021\">Most recently, several participants submitted a challenge proposal that was accepted at the <em>20th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2021)</em>: the<em>All The Agents Challenge (ATAC)</em> will take place in October 2021.</span> In addition, a one-day follow-up event was scheduled for July 9, 2021, and several participants offered to contribute to a shared \u201clive\u201d demonstrator space that would allow to integrate technologies and to try out new ideas across the targeted research areas (see also the working group report in Section 6.1).\n</p> \n <h3>The Virtual Seminar Format</h3> \n <p>The seminar was organized in a fully virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and brought together 45 participants across 4 different time zones. The seminar's schedule was designed for focused online interaction and to preserve to some extent the social dimension specific to regular Dagstuhl Seminars. The schedule was also designed to accommodate the participant's time zones as much as possible. To this end, the schedule was structured around\nthree types of sessions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>plenary sessions</em>: time-zone friendly sessions that constructed the backbone of the seminar (4h per day);</li>\n<li><em>Demos &amp; Tech sessions</em>: sessions reserved for presenting demonstrators and technologies relevant to the seminar (3 sessions of 2h); the objective of these sessions was to ground the discussions and to paint a picture of what can already be achieved with existing technologies;</li>\n<li><em>social events</em>: sessions reserved for online social interactions in a virtual representation of Schloss Dagstuhl via <span title=\"https://gather.town, accessed: 14.05.2021\">Gather.town</span>.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with five invited talks given by James Hendler, Mike Amundsen, Matthias Kovatsch and Simon Mayer (joint talk), Olivier Boissier, and Dave Raggett (in order of presentation). The invited talks were meant to help bootstrap the discussions and presented developments across the three research areas targeted by the seminar. The reduced virtual format did not allow for additional talks from participants, but we organized several rounds of personal introductions during the first two seminar days.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4691/concept-board.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <caption><b>Figure 2</b> Virtual concept board used to organize the seminar topics into working groups.</caption> \n <p>\nIn the third seminar day, participants used a virtual concept board (see Figure 2) to organize the seminar topics and to assign them into working groups for the rest of the week. The concept board was created from the seminar topics proposed by the co-organizers, the position statements submitted by participants prior to the seminar, and topics that emerged during the first two seminar days. In total, five working groups were created and four working\ngroups submitted consolidated discussion summaries for this report (see Section 6).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Demos &amp; Tech sessions attracted more submissions than initially foreseen: we initially scheduled two sessions in the second and third seminar days and eventually scheduled a third session in the fourth seminar day to accommodate all submissions. Submissions were in the form of short abstracts (see Section 5) and each participant was given 10 minutes to present\na live demonstrator and 5 minutes for questions.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview of the Report</h3> \n <p>This report is organized into four main parts. Section 3 includes the list of abstracts of the\ninvited talks. Section 4 includes position statements submitted by participants before and\nafter the seminar. Section 5 includes the list of abstracts for the demonstrators presented at\nthe seminar. Section 6 includes the reports submitted by the working groups created during\nthe seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>The co-organizers would like to thank Fabien Gandon and Simon Mayer for their enthusiasm and support in organizing this seminar. We would also like to thank the team of young researchers who volunteered to support this virtual format: Danai Vachtsevanou (seminar collector), Daniel Schraudner (architect of Virtual Schloss Dagstuhl), Cleber Amaral, Samuele Burattini, Angelo Croatti, Timotheus Kampik, and Adnane Mansour. Finally, we would like to thank Sussanne Bach-Bernhard, Sascha Daeges, and Michael Gerke for their assistance in\norganizing this seminar in a fully virtual format.\n</p> \n <h4>References</h4> \n <ol>\n<li>T.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe network science and graph mining community has created a rich portfolio of data analysis and visualisation techniques that have become a cornerstone for knowledge extraction from relational data on complex systems. Most of those techniques build on simple graph abstractions, where nodes represent a system\u2019s elements, and links represent <em>dyadic interactions, relations, or dependencies</em> between those elements. This mathematical formalism has proven useful for reasoning, e.g., about the centrality of nodes, the evolution and control of dynamical processes, and the community or cluster structure in complex systems, given that we have access to <em>relational data</em> [17]. However, the graph abstractions used in those methods typically do not account for <b>higher-order relations</b> between nodes that are present in many real complex systems. Important examples for such data include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>relational data that is inherently non-dyadic, such as (unordered) sets of authors co-authoring scientific articles, protein triplets in a cell that simultaneously interact with each other, or actors in social systems engaging in group collaborations,\n </li><li> time-stamped data on social networks with chronologically ordered sequences of (dyadic) interactions, where specific sequences of nodes interact via <em>causal paths</em>\n</li><li> sequential data on networked systems, such as user click streams, mobility trajectories, financial transaction sequences, citation paths, or directed acyclic graphs that give rise to a chronologically or topologically ordered sequences of nodes traversed by processes\n</li><li> data on networked systems with multiple types or layers of links that cannot be reduced to a simple graph model\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nOver the past years, researchers have shown that the presence of such higher-order interactions can fundamentally alter our understanding of complex systems. They can change our notion of the importance of nodes captured by centrality measures, affect the detection of cluster and community structures in graphs, and influence dynamical processes like diffusion or epidemic spreading, as well as associated control strategies in non-trivial ways [24, 28, 33, 4, 5, 10, 35]. To further develop graph-based representations of data\nand broaden their potential application in pattern recognition, data analysis, and machine learning, over the past few years researchers have developed a rich portfolio of <b>higher-order network models and representations</b> that capture more than just dyadic dependencies in complex systems. The organisers of this seminar have recently summarised current research and open challenges in this area in three independent overview and perspective articles [1, 30, 15]. An incomplete list of approaches explored over the past few years include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>hypergraphs, where each <em>hyperedge</em> can connect an arbitrary number of nodes [11]\n</li><li>simplicial network models, where <em>simplices</em> represent d-dimensional group interactions [12, 10]\n</li><li><em>d</em>-dimensional De Bruijn graphs, where edges capture <em>ordered</em> sets of <em>d</em> dyadic interactions [28, 16]\n</li><li>memory networks, where memory nodes capture Non-Markovian properties in time series data [24]\n</li><li>higher-, variable-, and multi-order Markov models for temporal networks [33, 20, 4]\n</li><li>multi-layer and multiplex networks with multiple types of links between nodes [13]\n</li><li>applications of categorical sequence mining techniques to model patterns in sequences of node sets [7]\n</li></ul> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4827/NetworkModels.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Illustration of standard graph model (left) and four modelling approaches capturing different types of higher-order interactions proposed in topological data analysis, network science,\nand computer science.

Figure adapted from [15].</caption> \n <p>\nIn Figure 1, we illustrate some of the higher-order graph models listed above. All these modelling approaches address the same fundamental limitation of graph models when studying complex systems: <b>we cannot understand a system\u2019s structure and dynamics by decomposing direct and indirect interactions between elements into a set of dyadic relations with a single type.</b> However, the similarities and differences between these different approaches are still not fully understood. \n</p> \n <p>At a critical time for the community, this Dagstuhl seminar intended to improve our understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, commonalities, and differences of these different approaches along with their resulting computational and epistemological challenges. The seminar aimed to create a common foundation for developing graph mining and machine learning techniques that use recent advances in the study of higher-order graph models by gathering key researchers from different communities, including machine learning, information retrieval and data mining, complex systems theory, theoretical physics, network science, computational social science, and mathematics. The participants included senior and junior researchers focusing on four related and intersecting topics: (i) Topological and Graph-Theoretic Foundations, (ii) Higher-Order Models for Dynamical Processes, (iii) Higher-Order Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, (iv) Computational Aspects in Higher-Order\nGraph Analysis and Graph Mining.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers used the four topics to structure the seminar program and derive the participants\u2019 initial assignment to possible working groups. After an initial round of brief opening statements, participants introduced themselves and stated their specific interests for the seminar during five-minute lightning talks. During a match-making session taking place in the afternoon of day one, all interests expressed by the participants were consolidated into a\nset of working groups, addressing the following six areas: (i) Visualisation and Interpretability of Higher-Order Graph Models, (ii) Learning and Model Selection, (iii) Unification of Different Higher-Order Modelling Frameworks, (iv) Benchmark Data and Evaluation Practices, (v) Applications of Higher-Order Graph Models, and (vi) Societal Impact, Robustness, and Fairness. In the remaining time of the seminar, participants worked on those issues in the\ngroups. This report includes summaries of the opening statements, the results of the working groups, and a summary of a panel discussion taking place on the evening of day two.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Federico Battiston, Giulia Cencetti, Iacopo Iacopini, Vito Latora, Maxime Lucas, Alice Patania, Jean-Gabriel Young, and Giovanni Petri.

            "data": "\n <p>\nProbabilistic methods play a central role in theoretical computer science. They are a powerful and widely applied tool used, for example, for designing efficient randomized algorithms and for establishing various lower bounds in complexity theory. They also form the basis of frameworks like average-case and smoothed analysis, in which algorithms are analyzed beyond the classical worst-case perspective. The seminar was on probabilistic methods with a focus on the design and analysis of algorithms.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\nProbabilistic methods are often used in algorithm analysis when worst-case analysis does not provide useful or empirically accurate results. For example, worst-case analysis suggests that the simplex method is an exponential-time algorithm for linear programming, while in fact it runs in near-linear time on almost all inputs of interest. For the simplex method and many other algorithms worst-case inputs are often rather contrived and occur hardly ever in practical applications. \nThe last decade has seen much interest in the development of a more realistic and robust algorithmic theory that is not entirely based on worst-case performance. One very successful line of research studies the performance of algorithms on inputs that are to some extent random. Besides average-case analysis, in which inputs are generated randomly according to some fixed distribution, also more sophisticated semi-random models have gained momentum.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother area in which probabilistic methods play a central role is stochastic optimization. Here uncertainty in the data is modeled by probability distributions and the actual data is only revealed over time. For example, in a scheduling problem one might know the probability distribution of a job's length but one learns its actual length only by executing it.\n</p> \n <p>\nProbabilistic methods are also central in algorithm design. For many optimization problems, the most efficient known algorithms rely essentially on randomization. In other areas, like sublinear algorithms and hashing, one can even prove that randomization is necessary to obtain good algorithms.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar covered recent progress in the context of probabilistic methods.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Bodo Manthey, Claire Mathieu, Heiko R\u00f6glin, and Eli Upfal\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe design of <em>data ecosystems</em>, infrastructures for the secure and reliable data exchange among organizations, is considered as one of the key technological enablers for digitalization and the digital economy of the future. Several applied research initiatives and industry consortia provide substantive evidence of this trend e.g., the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC)formed in the USA, the Industrial Data Space (IDS) founded in Germany and the associated\nconsortium International Data Space Association (IDSA)2. Most of these initiatives aim to provide a <em>reference architecture</em> for dealing with (i) <em>governance</em> aspects related to the definition of policies and conditions able to norm the participation to the data ecosystem, (ii) <em>security</em> aspects related to the definition of policies and infrastructures for guaranteeing\na trusted and secure exchange of data, (iii) <em>data and service management</em> aspects related to representation models and exchange formats and protocols, and (iv) <em>software design</em> principles related to the realization of the architectural components and their interaction.\n</p> \n <p>\nAll these aspects have been discussed in the seminar and the main findings are described in this report. In addition, a central new aspect of data ecosystems that we considered in the seminar lies in the view of data as having an economic value next to its intrinsic value to support operational and decisional core business activities. This means that in the data\necosystem, data is typically considered both a business asset and a business commodity which may be priced and sold in some form (e.g., data provisioning service or raw data) according to contracts.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs testified by the amount and variety of problems described above, the creation of such ecosystems poses many challenges cutting across a wide range of technological and scientific specializations. For this reason, the seminar involved researchers from different communities. Interdisciplinary discussions gave the possibility to analyze different perspectives and to achieve valuable outcomes presented in this report, such as a wide set of research challenges\nand the definition of interesting use cases for the further development of data ecosystems. Details about the activities carried out during the seminar are provided in the following.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview of the activities</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar took place from Monday September 23 until Friday September 27.\nThe seminar program encompassed four invited talks (keynotes and tutorials) on the first day (Sep. 23rd),\nby Gerald Spindler (law and ethics), Frank Piller (ecosystems and business models), Maurizio Lenzerini (data integration),\nand Boris Otto (International Data Space). After discussions related to the talks and tutorials, the remaining afternoon was spent\nstructuring (through joint discussion) the coming days of the seminar and group structure. \nAs a result, group structure was based on a thematic structure\nencompassing three groups, one for each of the topic areas Business, Data, and Systems. \nTuesday Sept. 24 began with a breakout into groups and election of scribes in each\nof the three groups (Business, Data, and Systems), and the remainder of the day was taken up by parallel group sessions in the three groups.\nWednesday Sept. 25 began with a joint session where each of the groups presented their work, which was then discussed jointly.\nThe afternoon (until the excursion) was taken up by joint discussion on report structure. \nThe morning of Thursday Sept. 26 encompassed joint discussion on a proposed joint manifesto as well as \t\ngroup discussions on application domains and application scenarios (topic areas were Health, SmartCities, Industry 4.0).\nThe afternoon was taken up by continued group discussions and ended with group presentations and joint discussion on \napplication domains and application scenarios. There was also further discussion on report structure at the end of the day.\nThe manifesto was subject to very lively discussion in the evening, after dinner.\nFriday Sept. 27, the last day of the seminar, was devoted to \nwrap-up (conclusions, summary, and report process) followed by joint discussion on relations between \nSystems, Data and Business views on the overall topic of the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe outcome of the seminar, which is documented in the remainder of this report, encompasses summaries of the group discussions and the joint manifesto.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Cinzia Cappiello, Avigdor Gal, Matthias Jarke, and Jakob Rehof\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nA central question has remained from the foundational crisis of mathematics about a century ago: \nWhat is the extent of intuitionistic mathematics? From a practical angle, the question  is to which extent any given\nproof is effective, which proofs of which theorems can be rendered effective, and whether and how\nnumerical information such as bounds and algorithms can be extracted from proofs. Ideally, all this\nis treated by manipulating proofs mechanically and/or by adequate proof-theoretic metatheorems (proof translations,\nautomated theorem proving, program extraction from proofs, proof analysis, proof mining, etc.).\nIn this vein, the central question should rather be put as follows: What is the computational content of proofs?\n</p> \n <p>\nGuided by this form of the central question, the Dagstuhl Seminar 21472 put a special focus on\ncoherent and geometric theories and their generalisations. These indeed are fairly widespread in\nmathematics and non-classical logics such as temporal and modal logics, a priori amenable\nfor constructivisation in the vein of Barr's Theorem, and particularly suited as a basis for automated\ntheorem proving. Specific topics included categorical semantics for geometric theories,  \ncomplexity issues of and algorithms for geometrisation of theories with the related speed-up questions, \nthe use of geometric theories in constructive mathematics up to finding algorithms, \nproof-theoretic presentation of sheaf models and higher toposes, and coherent logic for \nautomated proving. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 21472 attracted researchers and practitioners from all over the world, \nincluding participants from various research areas in order to broaden the scope of \nthe seminar and to create connections between communities. The seminar participants presented \nand discussed their research by means of programmed and ad-hoc talks, and a tutorial on Agda the well developed proof assistant based on dependent type theory - was held over several time slots. \nNumerous new research directions were developed in small working groups: for example, \nnew perspectives on classifying toposes in algebraic geometry,\napplications of dynamical methods to quadratic forms, and \nZorn induction to capture transfinite methods computationally.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe tireless efforts by Dagstuhl staff notwithstanding, it would not be fair to say that this seminar did \nnot suffer from the pandemic-related travel restrictions by which many invitees were confined to remote participation, \nwhich of course made hard if not impossible that they took part at the invaluable informal exchange on-site characteristic for events held at Dagstuhl. \nUnder the given circumstances, however, the seminar was still judged a success by all the participants. Following an unconditional request by many, \nthe organisers intend to propose a follow-up Dagstuhl seminar on a related topic in the near future - if possible, all on-site. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Thierry Coquand, Hajime Ishihara, Sara Negri, and Peter M.

            "data": "\n <h3>Topic and Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>Finite and Algorithmic Model Theory (FAMT) encompasses a number of research themes united around common\nmethods for analysing the expressive power of logical formalisms on structures that are either finite or\ncan be finitely represented. These are precisely the structures that can serve as inputs to computation and, for this reason, FAMT is intimately\nconnected to computer science. Over the past decades the subject has developed through a close interaction between theoretical computer science and\nclosely related areas of mathematics, including logic and combinatorics, and a strong research community has been forged,\nwith a common research agenda which has influenced several important areas of computer science.\nThe last Dagstuhl-like meeting of this research community before this seminar had been Aux Houches\nin 2012.\n</p> \n <p>The principal goals of the seminar have been the following:</p> \n <ol>\n<li> To identify fresh research challenges in the area of finite and algorithmic model theory, arising from the main application areas\nand to make new connections between core research in FAMT and emerging application areas, such as logic and learning.\n</li><li> To transfer knowledge from emerging methods and techniques in core FAMT to application areas.\n</li><li> To strengthen the research community in FAMT, especially by integrating younger members into it.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Organisation and Activities</h3> \n <p>The organisers developed a schedule consisting of three invited one-hour survey talks, more focussed regular contributions proposed by the participants, an open problem session, and a final discussion about the state and perspectives on the future of FAMT. The three survey talks were given by\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Wied Pakusa (Oxford) on recent achievements concerning the quest for a logic for polynomial time, focussing on Rank Logic and on Choiceless Polynomial Time,\n</li><li> Dan Suciu (Washington) on highlights of the connections between FAMT and databases.\n</li><li> Martin Grohe (Aachen) on new developments in machine learning and connections to FAMT.\n</li></ul> \n <p>In addition, 22 other participants gave regular talks on their\nrecent work on topics of FAMT. A further social highlight was a superb concert on Thursday evening performed by Jan Van den Bussche (violin),\nWolfgang Thomas (violin) and Jouko V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (piano).\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>The seminar exceeded our expectations in achieving our principal\ngoals.  The invited talk by Pakusa gave an overview on the status of the ongoing pursuit for a logic for PTIME, and demonstrated the depth and technical sophistication that FAMT has reached.  This  talk was complemented by  several insightful presentations on new and deep work on core topics of finite\nmodel theory. A particular highlight\nwas the double presentation by Torunczyk and Siebertz, who brought in new\nmethods from stability theory  to the study of the finite model theory of sparse structures.\n</p> \n <p>The invited talks by Grohe and Suciu explored new connections\nbetween the core methods of finite model theory and emerging areas of\napplications.  These talks were also complemented by several other talks on new directions in FAMT and on interactions of FAMT with other areas.\nIn particular, Gr\u00e4del's talk focussed on new work in the area of database provenance, while Atserias' \ntalk discussed a priori unexpected connections between  constraint satisfaction and  quantum information theory.  \n</p> \n <p>Overall, the presentations at the seminar were highly stimulating,  and we know through discussions during and\nafter the seminar  that the new work presented has motivated others to take up the\nexplorations of these questions. Based on  the feedback  received, we believe  that this seminar will serve as a catalyst for  new research directions in FAMT.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers regard the seminar as very successful.\nAs reflected in  the final discussion, there was a consistent sentiment expressed by the participants\nthat the FAMT community is in very healthy state. There are interesting new developments and\nexciting results in  different directions, there is a  strengthening of traditional connections to areas, such as\ndatabases and verification, but also new connections are emerging with such areas as  knowledge representation, learning theory,\nlogics for dependence and independence, and quantum information theory. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, there is an infusion of several outstanding young researchers who have the interest and hold the promise to advance FAMT in the years to come.\n</p> \n <p>The participants clearly expressed the wish to a have a next meeting of the FAMT community,\nbe it in Dagstuhl or elsewhere, within the next two to three years.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers are grateful to the Scientific Directorate of\nthe Center for its support of this workshop and the staff of Schloss\nDagstuhl for the perfect organisation of our stay and their hospitality.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anuj Dawar, Erich Gr\u00e4del, Phokion G.

            "data": "\n <p>\nReducibilities such as many-one, Turing or polynomial-time reducibility\nhave been an extraordinarily important tool in theoretical computer science from its very beginning. In recent years these reducibilites have been\ntransferred to the continuous setting, where they allow us to classify\ncomputational problems on real numbers and other continuous data types.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the late 1980s Weihrauch has introduced a reducibility that can be\nseen as an analogue of many-one reducibility for (multi-valued) functions on infinite data types. This reducibility, now called <em>Weihrauch reducibility</em>, was studied since the 1990s by Weihrauch's school of computable analysis and flourished recently when Gherardi and Marcone proposed this reducibility as a tool for a uniform approach to reverse analysis.\n</p> \n <p>\nReverse mathematics aims to classify theorems according to the axioms that are needed to prove these theorems in second-order arithmetic. This proof theoretic approach yields non-uniform classifications of the computational content of certain theorems. However, many of these classifications also have uniform\ncontent and Weihrauch complexity allows us to study this uniform computational content directly using methods of computability theory.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis perspective has motivated Dorais, Dzhafarov, Hirst, Mileti and\nShafer, on the one hand, Hirschfeldt and Jockusch, on the other hand, to study combinatorial problems using this approach. This research has led to a number of further reducibilities (computable reducibility, generalized Weihrauch reducibility and others) that can be seen as non-uniform or less resource sensitive versions of Weihrauch reducibility. Using this toolbox of reducibilities one can now adjust the instruments exactly according to the\ndegree of uniformity and resource sensitivity that one wants to capture.\n</p> \n <p>\nA precursor seminar (15392 Measuring the Complexity of\nComputational Content: Weihrauch Reducibility and Reverse Analysis, see\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4230/DagRep.5.9.77\">https://doi.org/10.4230/DagRep.5.9.77</a>) that was also held at Dagstuhl has been instrumental in bringing\ntogether researchers from these different communities for the first time. This has created a common forum and fostered several research developments in this field. We believe that the current seminar was very successful in strengthening and deepening the collaborations between the involved communities. Ample time was left and successfully used for research in groups. A novelty of the current seminar was a special session at which solutions of open problems from the\nprevious seminar were presented. To see that several of the major open\nproblems of the previous meetings were solved in the meantime was inspiring and\nmotivating! Some of the solutions involve new techniques with a wider applicability. Hopefully, we will see solutions to some of the open questions presented at the current seminar in the not too far future!\nAltogether, the seminar did proceed in a highly productive atmosphere,\nthanks to many excellent contributions from participants.\nInspired by these contributions the organizers are planning to edit a\nspecial issue of the journal <em>Computability</em> dedicated to this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis report includes abstracts of many talks that were presented during\nthe seminar, it includes a list of some of the open problems that were discussed, as well as a bibliography on Weihrauch complexity that was started during the previous meeting and that saw significant growth in the meantime. \nAltogether, this report reflects the extraordinary success of our seminar and we would like to use this opportunity to thank all participants for their\nvaluable contributions and the Dagstuhl staff for their excellent support!\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Vasco Brattka, Damir D.

            "title": "Well Quasi-Orders in Computer Science",
            "data": "\n <p>Computer Science, being a huge and complex conglomerate of theoretical disciplines, technological advances and social methodologies, strongly needs unifying concepts and techniques. In particular, relevant  mathematical concepts and theories are required. The notion of well quasi-order (or almost-full relation, if transitivity is not required -- a notion preferred by some authors) was discovered  independently by several mathematicians in the 1950-s and quickly evolved to a deep theory with many applications and remarkable results. Soon afterwards, well and better quasi-orders started to appear more and more frequently in different parts of theoretical computer science such as automata theory, term rewriting, verification of infinite-state systems, computations with infinite data, and others. Accordingly, an increasing number of researchers from different fields of computer science use notions and methods of Wqo-Theory.\nTherefore, it seemed to be the right time to have a broad discussion on how to speedup this process and to better understand the role of well quasi-orders in theoretical computer science.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics of the seminar</h3> \n <p>During this seminar we concentrated on the following four topics:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Logic and proofs\n</li><li> Automata and formal languages\n</li><li> Topological issues\n</li><li> Verification and termination problems\n</li></ol> \n <h4></h4> \n <p>Well quasi-orders, originally introduced in algebra, soon played an important role in proof theory: Higman's Lemma and Kruskal's Theorem are examples of theorems that are not provable in Peano Arithmetic. Determining the proof-theoretic strength of these (types of) theorems, as well as classifying them in terms of Reverse Mathematics, constituted an important endeavor. The concept of a WQO naturally extends to the more complex concept of a better quasi-order (BQO) which deals with infinite structures. Again, the proof theoretic strength of theorems on BQOs has been/must be investigated, and the theorems themselves can be used for more sophisticated termination problems. One of the open challenges is the strength of Fra\u00efss\u00e9's order type conjecture. Non-constructive proofs of this type of theorems (on WQOs) include proofs using the so-called minimal-bad-sequence argument. Investigating their strengths and also their computational content, via Friedman's A-translation or G\u00f6del's Dialectica Interpretation, has led to interesting results. To optimize these techniques so that realistic programs can be extracted from these classical proofs, using bar recursion, update recursion, selection functions, etc., is ongoing work. \n</p> \n <h4>Automata and formal languages</h4> \n <p>Well quasi-orders have many-fold connections to automata theory and\nformal language theory. In particular, there are nice characterizations of regular and context-free languages in terms of well quasi-orders, some lower levels of the concatenation hierarchies admit characterizations in terms of the subword relation and its relatives. Such characterizations sometimes help in getting new results, say on decidability of some levels of the concatenation\nhierarchy (Glasser, Schmitz, Selivanov). The same applies to\nomega-languages, though in this case the relationships are less\ninvestigated.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the topological level, it is known that Wadge reducibility (or\nreducibility by functions on omega-words computable by finite\nautomata) are well quasi-orders on the class of omega-regular\nfinite partitions of the Cantor space. Using some variants of the\nKruskal theorem on quasi-orderings of labeled trees, Selivanov was\nable to completely characterize the corresponding partial order,\nobtaining thus a complete extension of the Wagner hierarchy from sets\nof finite partitions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe mentioned relationships between Wqo-theory and formal languages are currently not well systematized, and many natural questions remain open. Further insights in this topic is essential for the development of this field.\n</p> \n <h4>Topological issues</h4> \n <p>An important task in computing with infinite data is to distinguish\nbetween computable and non-computable functions and, in the latter case,\nto measure the degree of non-computability. Usually, functions are\nnon-computable since they are not even continuous, hence a somewhat easier\nand more principal task is in fact to understand the degree of\ndiscontinuity of functions. This is  achieved by defining\nappropriate hierarchies and reducibility relations.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn classical descriptive set theory, along with the well-known\nhierarchies, Wadge introduced and studied an important reducibility relation on subsets of the Baire space. As shown by van Engelen et al, von Stein, Weihrauch\nand Hertling, this reducibility of subsets of topological spaces can\nbe generalized in various ways to a reducibility of functions on a topological space. In this way, the degrees of discontinuity of several important computational problems were classified. The transfer from sets to functions requires some notions and results of Wqo-theory in order to define and study hierarchies and reducibilities arising in this way. \n</p> \n <h4>Verification and termination problems</h4> \n <p>WQOs made their debut in computer science when Don Knuth suggested that Kruskal's Theorem might find an application in proving termination of programs. This was achieved a few years later by Nachum Dershowitz and the advent of recursive path orderings. Today, it is probably the area of software verification that provides the largest number of applications of WQOs in computer science. The decidability of coverability for well-structured transition systems (WSTS) crucially relies on the very properties of well quasi-orders. WSTS include Petri nets and their extensions, and more generally affine nets. They also include lossy channel systems, weak memory models, various process algebras, data nets, certain abstractions of timed Petri nets, and certain parametrized transition systems. The verification of new classes of transition systems prompts for new classes of WQOs. In addition to this, understanding the computational complexity of the resulting verification algorithms requires a finer analysis of minimal-bad-sequence arguments and their relation to hierarchies of recursive functions (Hardy, fast growing, etc.) \n</p> \n <h3>Report</h3> \n <p>One of the central purposes of the proposed seminar was to bring together\nresearchers from Wqo-theory and those from the related areas of computer science who actively apply notions and techniques of Wqo-theory. We wanted thus to encourage more interaction between the different communities, leading finally to a significant development of the mentioned fields. Overall, the seminar was very stimulating. The initial concerns that the four topics of the seminar might remain separate was quickly brushed off, as verification talks relied on concepts from logic (e.g., maximal order types), topological issues\nresonated with verification (e.g., Noetherian spaces), and all\nparticipated actively in vivid sessions of setting up and discussing\nopen questions.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo facilitate the interaction, each of the four topics of the seminar\nstarted with one or two introductory talks. In the topic <b>Logic and Proofs</b>, Diana Schmidt gave the first talk of the seminar\n\"Ordinal notations, the maximal ordertypes of Kruskal's Theorem and a\ntale of two cultures\", where she summarized work that started 40 years\nago, but is still of interest to date. Andreas Weiermann complemented\nthe introduction by addressing open problems concerning the so-called\nphase transitions (a topic which was then further elaborated by Lev Gordeev) \nin proof theory and the calculation of maximal ordertypes.  A number \nof contributions focused on the formalization of Kruskal type theorems \npossibly including the extraction of computational content, leading to various \npractical exchange sessions in the evenings (see also next paragraph). \nThe topic was continued on Tuesday by Alberto Marcone who gave a \nsurvey on WQOs and BQOs in Reverse Mathematics, followed various talks and discussions on open questions around better quasi-orderings.  Another highlight of the second day were two contributions on the Graph Minor Theorem: Chun-Hung\nLiu reported on his recent proof of a conjecture by Robertson\ninvolving topological minors, and Michael Rathjen looked at the Graph\nMinor Theorem to determine its proof theoretic strength. Of the further\ncontributions we want to specifically mention Julia Knight who made \nthe connection between WQOs and Hahn-Fields.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe topic <b>Verification</b> was addressed  by Philippe Schnoebelen in\n\"Well quasi-orderings and program verification\" on Monday afternoon,\nwith a gentle introduction to the field of well-structured transition systems (WSTS).  Although this was an introductory talk, he took the opportunity to introduce the class of priority channel systems as an example, whose decidability results rely on a form of well quasi-ordering with gap embedding.  Such orderings require very high maximal order types, and led to the open question of giving a formula, or even lower and upper bounds, for those maximal\norder types. This has direct consequences on the complexity of verification.  Alain Finkel proceeded to give another talk on the verification of WSTS, \"Decidability results on infinitely branching WSTS, which completed the introduction given by Philippe Schnoebelen, and quickly proceeded to explore the challenges of verifying WSTS that are infinitely branching. He explained that deciding termination, coverability, and boundedness could be done through computations that involve a so-called completion of the WSTS, generalizing the well-known Karp-Miller construction for Petri nets -- some of these problems turn out to be decidable, some others not.  Crucially, in the decidable cases, even if the WSTS is infinitely branching, its completion is always finitely branching. Maurice Pouzet made the observation that the key result used there,\nthat every downwards closed set of a WQO is a union of finitely many\nideals, is due to Kabil and himself in 1992, and that this was still\ntrue for the more general class of FAC (finite antichain) orders.\nFAC orders were the subject of the next presentation, by Mirna Dzamonja, entitled \"On the width of FAC orders\". She started from the fact that, while height, length and width of well quasi-orders are important notions, width generalizes to all FAC orders, and that we can compute the width of FAC orders\ndefined from FAC constituents.  One consequence is that for every ordinal alpha, there is a WQO of width exactly alpha.  The main open question is to be able to compute the width of a finite product of FAC orders.  The width of the product of two ordinals is known, but is given by a complex formula.  Mirna Dzamonja gave some new results on the question, in particular for some three-way products.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe final two Monday contributions were concerned with very different questions, namely mechanized proofs of Higman's Lemma, one of the core results\nin well quasi-order theory. Christian Sternagel described a proof of Higman's Lemma by so-called open induction, a concept akin to Scott induction in domain theory, as one of the participants noticed.  The proof is a considerably simplified version of a proof of the same kind given by Alfons Geser.  Open\ninduction was again the subject of Thomas Powell's talk \"Open induction and the\nDialectica interpretation\" on Friday morning.\nHelmut Schwichtenberg concluded the afternoon of Monday, just before a\nrump session dedicated to open questions. He gave a talk \"on the\ncomputational content of Higman's Lemma\", stressing that different\nconstructive proofs of the same theorem yield programs -- by the Curry-Howard correspondence -- that behave differently in practice. This resonated with the last morning talk of the same day, \"An axiom-free Coq proof of Kruskal's Theorem\", by Dominique Larchey-Wendling, on a recent constructive proof of the much more complex Kruskal theorem, inspired from and generalizing a proof due to Wim Veldman.\n</p> \n <p>\nOther verification-oriented talks were given by Mizuhito Ogawa\non Thursday morning, \"Notes on regularity and WQOs, and well-structured pushdown systems\", which gave new decidability results for coverability on extended forms of transition systems, through the use of so-called P-automata.  In the evening, Roland Meyer explained how one can encode certain depth-bounded, breadth-bounded, and name-bounded processes of the pi-calculus into well-structured transition systems, and obtain decidability results through\nacceleration techniques, akin (again) to the Karp-Miller technique\nalready mentioned above. Sylvain Schmitz provided us with a glimpse\nof the new complexity classes that had to be invented in recent\nyears to characterize the complexity of the standard decidable\nproblems for classical WSTS.  These are classes of very high\ncomplexity: Ackermannian, hyper-Ackermannian, and others.  This\nwas a talk that unified the concerns of verification with the\nlogical view, based on maximal ordertypes, and introduced by Andreas\nWeiermann and others.This provided a natural link with the last talk in the verification\nstrand, \"Trace universality for VASS\", given by Simon Halfon, who\nexplained what the problem was, that it relied on the fact that\nall bad sequences of finite subsets of d-tuples of natural\nnumbers are finite, that it is Ackermann-complete for d=1, and he then\nproceeded to explain what was known in the cases dgeq 2,\non which he is working.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe topic <b>Topological Issues</b> was introduced  by  Victor Selivanov in \"Well quasi-orders and Descriptive Set Theory\" on Tuesday afternoon, and by Jean Goubault-Larrecq in \"A Gentle Introduction to Noetherian Spaces\" on Wednesday morning. Selivanov gave a short survey of the relationships between Wqo-Theory and Descriptive Set Theory, as well as a discussion of several interesting open questions in this field. Even the definition and basics of BQOs are related to Descriptive Set Theory, as was demonstrated in the talks by Alberto Marcone and Yann Pequignot on Tuesday. Other connections were given by Raphael Carroy on Tuesday (discussing some WQOs on continuous functions), by Oleg Kudinov on Wednesday (discussing joint results with Selivanov on definability issues for some popular WQOs) and by Peter Hertling on Friday (giving an overview of results about Weihrauch reducibilities).\nGoubault-Larrecq introduced an important topological extension of the notion of WQO which motivates several interesting open questions. Some of these questions were addressed in the subsequent Wednesday talks by Matthew de Brecht and Arno Pauly.\nBoth mentioned directions in the topic <b>Topological Issues</b> look very prospective and deserve additional attention.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe topic <b>Automata and Formal Languages</b> was surveyed by Mizuhito Ogawa on Thursday morning who summarized several interesting facts relating WQOs to popular classes of languages and omega-languages on words and trees (cf.  also the topic <b>Verification</b>). Automata and Formal Languages were also addressed on Tuesday by Selivanov who related WQOs to his extension of the Wagner hierarchy from the case of sets to the case of k-partitions. Another related talk was given on Thursday by Willem Fouch\u00e9 who discussed some applications of Ramsey theory to unavoidable regularities in words. Although  <b>Automata and Formal Languages</b> turned out slightly underrepresented at this seminar, the relationship between Wqo-Theory and Formal Languages seems quite important and deserves further investigation which we hope to include in a future seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jean Goubault-Larrecq and Monika Seisenberger and Victor Selivanov and Andreas Weiermann\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe goal of the seminar was to focus on several broadly applicable\nlearning outcomes for first year university computer science courses,\nlooking at what it would take to understand and assess them in\nmultiple pedagogic contexts.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn preparation for the seminar, we surveyed participants to get an\nunderstanding of a what could be a common denominator of CS1/2\nlearning outcomes, using the outcomes from the ACM CC 2013 curriculum\nas a starting point.

            "title": "SE4ML \u2013 Software Engineering for AI-ML-based Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAny AI- and ML-based systems will need to be built, tested, and maintained, yet there is a lack of established engineering practices in industry for such systems because they are fundamentally different from traditional software systems. Building such systems requires extensive trial and error exploration for model selection, data cleaning, feature selection, and parameter tuning. Moreover, there is a lack of theoretical understanding that could be used to abstract away these subtleties. Conventional programming languages and software engineering paradigms have also not been designed to address challenges faced by AI and ML practitioners. This seminar brainstormed ideas for developing a new suite of ML-relevant software development tools such as debuggers, testers and verification tools that increase developer productivity in building complex AI systems. It also discussed new innovative AI and ML abstractions that improve programmability in designing intelligent systems.   \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together a diverse set of attendees, primarily coming from two distinct communities: software engineering  and programming languages vs. AI and machine learning.\nEven within each community, we had attendees with various backgrounds and a different emphasis in their research.\nFor example, within software engineering the profile of our attendees ranged from pure programming languages, development methodologies, to automated testing. Within, AI, this seminar brought together people on the side of classical AI, as well as leading experts on applied machine learning, machine learning systems, and many more. \nWe also had several attendees coming from adjacent fields, for example attendees whose concerns are closer to human-computer interaction, as well as representatives from industry.\nFor these reasons, the first two days of the seminar were devoted to bringing all attendees up to speed with the perspective that each other field takes on the problem of developing, maintaining, and testing AI/ML systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the first day of the seminar, Ahmed Hassan and Tim Menzies represented the field of software engineering. Their talks laid the foundation for a lot of subsequent discussion by presenting some key definitions in software engineering for machine learning (SE4ML), identifying areas where there is a synergy between the fields, informing the seminar about their experiences dealing with industry partners, and listing some important open problems.\nSameer Singh and Christopher R\u00e9 took care of the first day's introduction to machine learning. Christopher R\u00e9 described recent efforts in building machine learning systems to help maintain AI/ML systems, specifically for managing training data, and monitoring a deployed system to ensure it keeps performing adequately. Sameer Singh's talk focused on bug finding, and debugging machine learning systems, either by inspecting black-box explanations, generating realistic adversarial examples in natural language processing (NLP), and doing behavioral testing of NLP models to make them more robust.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe second day of the seminar continued to introduce the attendees to some prominent approaches for tackling the SE4ML problem. \nElena Glassman presented her work at the intersection of human-computer interaction and software engineering, while Jie Zhang gave an overview of software testing for ML, based on her recent survey of the field.\nSignificant attention during the seminar was spent on the problem of deploying machine learning models in environments that change over time,  where the behavior of the AI/ML system diverges from the intended behavior when the model was first developed. \nFor example, such issues were discussed by Barbara Hammer in her talk on machine learning in non-stationary environments.\nIsabel Valera introduced the seminar to another important consideration when developing AI/ML-based systems: interpretability and algorithmic fairness.\nAndrea Passerini's talk was aimed at explaining some of the basic principles of machine learning for a non-machine learning audience; for example generalization, regularization, and overfitting, as well as some recent trands in combining learning with symbolic reasoning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe remainder of the seminar was centered around various breakout sessions and working groups, including sessions on (1) Specifications and Requirements, (2) Debugging and Testing, (3) Model Evolution and Management, and (4) Knowledge Transfer and Education.\nThere were extended discussions on the question \"what is a bug?\" in an AI/ML setting, what is a taxonomy of such bugs, and can we list real-world examples of such bugs happening in practice.\nInterleaved with these working groups, there were several demand-driven talks, designed to answer questions that came up during the discussions. For example, Steven Holtzen and Parisa Kordjamshidi introduced the seminar to efforts in the AI community to build higher-level languages for machine learning, in particular probabilistic programming and declaritive learning-based programming.\nChristian K\u00e4stner shared his insights from teaching software engineering for AI/ML-based systems using realistic case studies.\nMolham Aref gave his unique view on developing such systems from industry, which was a tremendously valuable perspective to include in these discussions.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, this seminar produced numerous new insights into how complex AI-ML systems are designed, debugged, and tested. It was able to build important scientific bridges between otherwise disparate fields, and has spurred collaborations and follow-up work.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Kristian Kersting, Miryung Kim, Guy Van den Broeck, and Thomas Zimmermann\n                </div> \n",

The talks were meant to be inspiring and thought-provoking, channeling ideas for the following days.\nWhile some missed the established procedure with longer talks, the new format was overall very well received and allowed for many different thoughts and concepts to be presented and discussed in relatively short time.\n</p> \n <p>\nFour working groups formed at the end of the first day for the norm-related topics responsibility, new logics, ethics/values and (machine) learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of the group sessions, on the second and fourth day, was to get a shared understanding of the specific topics and to identify future research possibilities. Each group reported back in a plenary session at the end of each group work day, where the groups also tried to establish interconnections between them.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Responsibility.</b> This group discussed how to grasp the very abstract concept of responsibility. A big chunk was dedicated to the formalization of responsibility. Many (vastly different) assumptions were laid out. The problem of \"delegating responsibility\" was discussed with special intensity. The group (being by far the largest one) split later to discuss different notions of responsibility on the basis of selected examples. A working paper was produced, included in this report under Section~\nef{Sec:resp}.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>New logics.</b> The aim of this group was to find out how to tackle norms and responsibility in terms of logics, especially how new logics for this task could be devised.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Ethics/values.</b> This group discussed the more ethics-oriented aspects of normative systems. Values provide an additional layer for normative reasoning: e.g. \"how acceptable is it to violate a given norm?\" The group produced a draft of a paper on \"The Value(s) of Water\" connecting NorMAS to the AI for Good initiative. Work is planned to continue during 2018 resulting in a paper for publication, e.g. in ACM communications or a similar outlet.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>(Machine) Learning.</b> The learning group discussed the opportunity of integrating norms and responsibility into machine learning procedures. As those are usually opaque, this presents as a notable challenge. For example, the learning's input data has to be pre-processed to get a normatively acting system. Also, the learned sub-symbolic system should be enhanced with \"regular\" symbolic reasoning, which can be better regulated by norms and analysed for responsibility.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe fourth day was further enriched by a brainstorming session to identify possible applications. The subsequent clustering revealed the topics\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>transport</b>, e.g. smart grid/home, intelligent cars,\n</li><li><b>tools</b>, e.g. for autonomous service composition, legal reasoning, or supporting software/requirements engineering,\n</li><li><b>climate &amp; agriculture</b>, e.g. agents negotiating fertilizer and water use, or an app that helps monitoring personal climate-affecting activities,\n</li><li><b>societies</b>, e.g. norms improving sustainability, monitoring of online forums for bad behavior or hate speech detection,\n</li><li><b>security</b>, e.g. protecting personal freedom by dynamically analysing normative consequences of law proposals, monitoring a company's compliance with EU regulations, improving access to restricted access datasets, or making societies resilient for data surveillance by means of contract negotiations,\n</li><li><b>health</b>, e.g. ethical decision-making, norms for improving personal health and fitness, defining wellbeing by norms, handling of patient/health data, and a big interest in healthcare robots,\n</li><li><b>energy</b>, e.g. modelling energy security with norms, managing air quality, observing long-term consequences, agents monitoring (personal) energy use to identify bad behavior, or regulating industrial relations or the energy and material footprint.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe application areas were discussed in a plenary session and formed the input to the discussion on future plans for the NorMAS community. Several conferences were identified to target proposals for a NorMAS-related workshop as part of the event. The community sees many relevant application areas not in the least in autonomous internet services and physical agents susch as robots, vehicles and drones, where social reasoning will be of the utmost importance. Bringing the work from NorMAS to these areas will be highly benificial to the involved communities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mehdi Dastani, J\u00fcrgen Dix,  and Harko Verhagen\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Empirical Evaluation of Secure Development Processes",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe problem of how to design and build secure systems has been long-standing. For example, as early as 1978 Bisbey and Hollingworth[6] complained that there was no method of determining what an appropriate level of security for a system actually was. In the early years various design principles, architectures and methodologies were proposed: in 1972 Anderson[5] described the \u201creference monitor\u201d concept, in 1974 Saltzer[7] described the \u201cPrinciple of least privilege\u201d, and in 1985 the US Department of Defense issued the Trusted\nComputer System Evaluation Criteria[8].\n</p> \n <p>\nSince then, although much progress has been made in software engineering, cybersecurity and industrial practices, much of the fundamental scientific foundations have not been addressed \u2013 there is little empirical data to quantify the effects that these principles, architectures and methodologies have on the resulting systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis situation leaves developers and industry in a rather undesirable situation. The lack of this data makes it difficult for organizations to effectively choose practices that will cost-effectively reduce security vulnerabilities in a given system and help development teams\nachieve their security objectives. There has been much work creating security development lifecycles, such as the Building Security In Maturity Model[1], Microsoft Security Development LifeCycle[3] OWASP[4] and ISECOM[2] and these incorporate a long series of recommended practices on requirements analysis, architectural threat analysis, and hostile code review. It is agreed that these efforts are, in fact, beneficial. However, without answers as to why they\nare beneficial, and how much, it is extremely difficult for organizations to rationally improve these processes, or to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of any specific technique.\n</p> \n <p>The ultimate goal of this seminar was to create a community for empirical science in software engineering for secure systems. This is particularly important in this nascent of research in this domain stage since there is no venue in which researchers meet and exchange. Currently single pieces of work are published at a wide variety of venues such as IEEE S&amp;P, IEEE EuroS&amp;P, ACM CCS, USENIX Security, SOUPS, SIGCHI, ICSE, USEC, EuroUSEC, and many more. The idea was that bringing together all researchers working separately and\ncreating an active exchange will greatly benefit the community.\n</p> \n <p>Naturally, community-building is a long-term activity \u2013 we can initiate it at a Dagstuhl seminar, but it will require continuous activity. Our more immediate goals were to develop a manifesto for the community elucidating the need for research in this area, and to provide <em>actionable</em> and <em>concrete</em> guidance on how to overcome the obstacles that have hindered\nprogress.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne aspect of this was information gathering on how to conduct academic research which is able to be transitioned and consumed by developers. We felt that all too frequently developer needs aren\u2019t fully understood by academics, and that developers underestimate the relevance of academic results. Our information gathering will help foster mutual understanding between\nthese two groups and we specifically looked for ways to build bridges between them.\n</p> \n <p>\nA second obstacle which we aimed to address is how to produce sufficiently convincing\nempirical research at a foundational level as well as in the specific application areas. Currently\nthere is no consensus on what are ecologically valid studies and there are sporadic debates on\nthe merits of the different approaches. This seminar included a direct and focused exchange\nof experience and facilitated the creation of much needed guidelines for researchers. In\naccordance with our bridge building, we also looked at what developers find convincing, and\nhow that aligns with research requirements.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Format</h3> \n <p>\nOur seminar brought together thirty-three participants from industry, government and both\nthe security and software engineering academic communities. Before the seminar started we\nprovided participants with the opportunity to share background readings amongst themselves.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe began our seminar with level-setting and foundational talks from industrial, software\nengineering and security participants aimed to foster a common level of understanding of the\ndiffering perspectives of the various communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing this the seminar was very dynamic: during each session we broke into break-out\ngroups whose topics were dynamically generated by the participants. The general mandate for\neach group was to tackle an aspect of the general problem and be actionable and concrete: we\nwished to avoid vague discussions of the difficulties involved with studying secure development\nbut instead focus on how to improve our understanding and knowledge. After each session\nwe met again as a group and summarized each group\u2019s progress.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the conclusion of the seminar we brought together all the participants in a general\ndiscussion about further activities. In all, a total of eighteen further activities, ranging from\npapers to research guideline documents, were proposed and organized by the participants.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Building security in maturity model. <a href=\"http://www.bsimm.com/\">http://www.bsimm.com/</a>.\n</li><li> Isecom. <a href=\"http://www.isecom.org\">http://www.isecom.org</a>.\n</li><li> Microsoft security development lifecycle. <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/</a>.\n</li><li> Owasp. <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org\">https://www.owasp.org</a>.\n</li><li> Anderson, J.

            "title": "Computational Proteomics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 21271 \"Computational Proteomics\" discussed several important developments, challenges, and opportunities that are emerging in the field of computational proteomics. Three core topics were set out at the start, and these were discussed at length throughout the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese three topics were: (i) the fast evolving use of advanced machine learning approaches in proteomics; (ii) the challenges and opportunities offered by fast developing approaches for structural and top-down proteomics; and (iii) specific issues and computational complications in glycoproteomics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe machine learning and glycoproteomics topics were each introduced by a dedicated lecture, which set out the current state-of-the-art and presented a tentative set of issues, challenges, or opportunities that could be explored during the seminar. The structural and top-down proteomics topic was introduced by two sequential lectures, one on structural proteomics, and one on top-down proteomics. In total, four introductory talks were thus presented at the start of the seminar. For each of the three main topics, daily Working Group sessions were organised, which took place in the morning and afternoon, with a daily late-night session scheduled each day to wrap up the day's outcomes. This structure was followed to allow maximum involvement by online participants across the various timezones in the hybrid format. The Machine Learning in Proteomics Working Group also spun out another Working Group session during the seminar, which discussed the creation of a machine learning (Kaggle-like) competition based on proteomics data.\n</p> \n <p>\nEach of these breakout sessions was very actively attended, including by online attendees, and resulted in several interesting research ideas and potential new initiatives. The Machine Learning in Proteomics Working Group was the largest working group, and addressed a number of distinct topics during the seminar. Of particular note were the spin-out effort to establish two machine learning competitions based on proteomics data and challenges to engage the broader machine learning community, and the extensive discussions on the optimal way to represent mass spectrometry data for downstream machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Glycoproteomics Working Group was very actively attended, and discussed an exciting set of topics. A first highlight among these topics was provided by the extensive and detailed discussions with the Machine Learning Working Group regarding the potential of, and road towards, the use of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in glycoproteomics. A second highlight concerned the delineation of a set of high-impact opinion papers to describe the state-of-the-art of the field, and its goals, ambitions, and challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Structural and Top-Down Proteomics Working Group was very active in detailing the many challenges and opportunities in this fast-evolving field. One noteworthy challenge revolved around the detection, annotation, and biological interpretation of post-translational modifications detected by mass spectrometry. A second challenge concerned the standardization of acquired native mass spectrometry data, the minimal reporting requirements for these experiments, and the dissemination of these data.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the 2021 Dagstuhl Seminar on Computational Proteomics was extremely successful as a catalyst for careful yet original thinking about key challenges in the field, and as a means to enable downstream progress by setting important, high impact goals to work on in close collaboration. During this Seminar, new topics for a future Seminar were suggested throughout as well, indicating that this active field will continue to yield novel challenges and opportunities for advanced computational work going forward.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Lennart Martens, Rebekah Gundry, and Magnus Palmblad\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Big Stream Processing Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>As the world gets more instrumented and connected, we are witnessing a flood of digital data that is getting generated, in a high velocity, from different hardware (e.g., sensors) or software in the format of streams of data. Examples of this phenomena are crucial for several applications and domains including financial markets, surveillance systems, manufacturing, smart cities and scalable monitoring infrastructure. In these applications and domains, there is a crucial requirement to collect, process, and analyze big streams of data in order to extract valuable information, discover new insights in real-time and to detect emerging patterns and outliers. Recently, several systems (e.g., Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Storm, Heron, Spark Streaming,) have been introduced to tackle the real-time processing of big streaming data. However, there are several challenges and open problems that need to be addressed in order improve the state-of-the-art in this domain and push big stream processing systems to make them widely used by large number of users and enterprises.  The aim of this seminar was to bring together active and prominent researchers, developers and practitioners actively working in the domain of big stream processing to discuss very relevant open challenges and research directions. The plan was to work on specific challenges including the trade-offs of the various design decisions of big stream processing systems, the declarative stream querying and processing languages, and the benchmarking challenges of big stream processing systems. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn Monday morning, the workshop officially kicked off with a round of introductions about the participants where adhoc clusters for the interests of the participants have been defined. The clusters have been revolving around the topics of systems, query languages, benchmarking, stream mining and semantic stream processing. The program of the seminar included 4 tutorials, one per day. On Monday, Martin Strohbach from AGT International presented different case studies and scenarios for large scale stream processing in different application domains. On Tuesday, we enjoyed the systems tutorial which has been presented by Paris Carbone from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Thomas Weise from Data Torrent Inc. and Matthias J. Sax from Confluent Inc. Paris presented an interesting overview of the journey of stream processing systems, Thomas presented the recent updates about the Apache Apex system while Matthias presented an overview about the Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams projects. On Wednesday, Martin Hirzel from IBM TJ Watson Research Center presented a tutorial about the taxonomy and classifications of stream processing languages. On Thursday, Tilmann Rabl from TU Berlin presented a tutorial about the challenges of benchmarking big data systems in general in addition to the specific challenges for benchmarking big stream processing systems. All tutorials have been very informative, interactive and involved very deep technical discussions. On Thursday evening, we had a lively demo session where various participants demonstrated their systems to the audience on parallel round-table interactive discussions.  On Wednesday, the participants split into two groups based on common interest in selected subset of the open challengers and problems. The selected 2 topics of the groups were systems and query languages. Thursday schedule was dedicated to working group efforts. Summary about the outcomes of these 2 groups is included in this report. It is expected that work from at least one of the groups to be submitted for publication, and we expect further research publications to result directly from the seminar. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe that the most interesting aspect of the seminar was providing the opportunity to freely engage in direct and interactive discussions with solid experts and researchers in various topics of the field with common focused passion and interest. We believe that this is a unique feature for Dagstuhl seminars. We received very positive feedback from the participants and we believe that most of the participants were excited with the scientific atmosphere at the seminar and reported that the program of the seminar was useful for them. In summary, we consider the organization of this seminar as a success. We are grateful for the Dagstuhl team for providing the opportunity and full support to organize it. The success of this seminar motivated us to plan for future follow-up seminars to continue the discussions on the rapid advancements on the domain and plan for narrower and more focused discussion with concrete outputs for the community.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Hirzel, Tilmann Rabl, and Sherif Sakr\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar focused on  <em>autonomous systems</em>, and more specifically robots, that operate without, or with little, external supervision. For these systems to be integrated into society, it is highly important to make sure that they are functionally safe. <em>Formal Methods</em> are techniques adopted in engineering for the verification of software and hardware \nsystems. As models are a basic requirement for the formal analysis of systems, <em>Model-driven Software Engineering</em> plays an important role to enable\nthe application of <em>Formal Methods</em>. Though autonomous systems are increasingly involved in our everyday life,  both exact formalizations of safe functionality (standards, what we want to be confident in) and methods to achieve confidence (methodologies, how we get confident in the properties we want to assure) are still scarce.\n\nThis seminar brought together experts in <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> and <em>Robotics</em>, <em>Model-driven Software Engineering</em>, and <em>Formal Methods</em>. It included researchers from academia as well as from industry. The following list summarizes high-level themes that emerged from the seminar:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> Dealing with highly complex systems, it is difficult to verify or even model all aspects of the system, therefore focusing effort on efficient falsification rather than costly verification can be highly impactful for industrial applications.\n</li><li> The community can and should leverage results and systems built for different robotic competitions to reason about possible requirements and techniques to verify/falsify them. These competitions include the DARPA robotics challenge, the Amazon picking challenge, different leagues in Robocup, etc. Creating benchmarks based on these competitions will enable progress in verification of autonomous systems.\n</li><li>   Creating small interdisciplinary teams that include people from formal methods, robotics and model based design that tackle small yet realistic problems, possibly inspired by industrial applications, will help formalize the language of requirements, models and verification techniques that will have an impact on autonomous systems.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Erika Abraham, Hadas Kress-Gazit, Lorenzo Natale, and Armando Tacchella\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nLooking back at the last decade, one can observe enormous progress in the domain of vehicular networking. In this growing community, many ongoing activities focus on the design of communication protocols to support safety applications, intelligent navigation, cooperative driving and others. Using the terms Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC), Car-2-X (C2X), or Vehicle-2-X (V2X), many applications \u2013 as interesting as challenging \u2013 have been envisioned and (at least) partially realized. Very large projects have been initiated to validate the theoretic work in field tests and protocols are being standardized. With the increasing interest from industry, security and privacy have also become crucial aspects in the stage of protocol design in order to support a smooth and carefully planned roll-out. We are now entering an era that might change the game in road traffic management. Many car makers already supply their recent brands with cellular and WiFi modems, some also adding vehicular WLAN (DSRC, ITS-G5) and/or C-V2X technologies, which focus on V2V and V2I communication.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe management and control of network connections among vehicles and between vehicles and an existing network infrastructure is currently one of the most challenging and active research fields in the networking domain. There is a long list of desirable applications that can be grouped into four IVC categories:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>e-Safety applications that try to make driving safer, e.g., road hazard warning, collision warning;\n</li><li> traffic efficiency applications aiming at more efficient and thus greener traffic, e.g., detection of traffic jams, traffic distribution;\n</li><li> manufacturer oriented applications, e.g., automatic software updates; and\n</li><li> convenience applications, e.g., automatic map updates.\n</li></ol> \n <p>We initiated the \u201cInter-Vehicular Communication\u201d Dagstuhl Series back in 2010, when a first Dagstuhl Seminar was organized on this topic. The motivation was to bring together experts in this field to investigate the state of the art and to highlight where sufficient solutions already existed. The main outcome of this very inspiring seminar series was that there are indeed areas within this research field where scientific findings are being consolidated and adopted by industry. This was the consensus of quite intriguing discussions among participants from both industry and academia. Yet, even more aspects have been identified where substantial research is still needed.\n</p> \n <p>Some of the findings of the first three seminars in this series have been published not only in the related Dagstuhl reports but also in widely visible magazine articles:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Falko Dressler, Frank Kargl, J\u00f6rg Ott, Ozan K.

Edge computing is currently becoming one of the core building blocks of cellular networks, including 5G, and it is necessary to study how to integrate ICT components of moving systems. The trade-offs of computation distribution, system aspects, and the impact on end-to-end latency are still unanswered.\nAlso, vehicular networking and cooperative driving focuses almost exclusively on cars but leaves out communication and coordination with, for example, pedestrians and bicyclists. For example, many of the existing communication solutions for this scenario were designed without having battery constraints in mind. In the mean-time, some early research has been initiated on this topic, we organized a workshop at INFORMATIK 2019 on VRUs and initial projects report very interesting results on safety features for VRUs. Building upon the great\nsuccess of the first two seminars, with this follow-up seminar, our goal was to once again bring together experts from all these fields from both academia and industry. The seminar focused intensively on discussions in several working groups. To kick-off these discussions, we invited three keynote talks:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Distributed machine learning in the vehicle-to-edge continuum by Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini (Polytechnic University of Turin, IT)\n</li><li>A TechCity Living lab for vehicular-based mobility services in the road by Susana Sargento (Institute of Telecommunications, PT)\n</li><li>Edge-based increase of awareness and support for all traffic participants by Lars Wolf (TU Braunschweig, DE)\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nWe finally organized the following working groups on some of the most challenging issues related to inter-vehicular communication and cooperative driving:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Edge Computing: A multi-dimensional techno-economic outlook (i.e., latency, cost, deployment issues, etc.)\n</li><li>Cooperative Driving Again: Where are we now after 2018? What about vehicular platooning: Is it still alive? What are still unsolved challenges?\n</li><li>How do we support VRU detection/warning?\n</li><li>Forget about V2V, we have V2C: Is Vehicle-to-Cloud the Way to Go?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Falko Dressler, Frank Kargl, J\u00f6rg Ott, Ozan K.

            "title": "Eyewear Computing \u2013 Augmenting the Human with Head-mounted Wearable Assistants",
            "data": "\n <p>\nComputing devices worn on the human body have a long history in academic and industrial research, most importantly in wearable computing, mobile eye tracking, and mobile mixed and augmented reality. In contrast to traditional systems, body-worn devices are always with the user and therefore have the potential to perceive the world and reason about it from the user's point of view. At the same time, given that on-body computing is subject to ever-changing usage conditions, on-body computing also poses unique research challenges. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis is particularly true for devices worn on the head. As humans receive most of their sensory input via the head, it is a particularly interesting body location for simultaneous sensing and interaction as well as cognitive assistance. Early egocentric vision devices were rather bulky, expensive, and their battery lifetime severely limited their use to short durations of time. Building on existing work in wearable computing, recent commercial egocentric vision devices and mobile eye trackers, such as Google Glass, PUPIL, and J!NS meme, pave the way for a new generation of \"smart eyewear\" that are light-weight, low-power, convenient to use, and increasingly look like ordinary glasses. This last characteristic is particularly important as it makes these devices attractive for the general public, thereby holding the potential to provide a research and product platform of unprecedented scale, quality, and flexibility.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile hearing aids and mobile headsets became widely accepted as head-worn devices, users in public spaces often consider novel head-attached sensors and devices as uncomfortable, irritating, or stigmatising. Yet with the advances in the following technologies, we believe eyewear computing will be a very prominent research field in the future:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> Increase in storage/battery capacity and computational power allows users to run eyewear computers continuously for more than a day (charging over night) gathering data to enable new types of life-logging applications.\n</li><li>Miniaturization and integration of sensing, processing, and interaction functionality can enable a wide array of applications focusing on micro-interactions and intelligent assistance.\n</li><li> Recent advances in real-life tracking of cognitive activities (e.g. reading, detection of fatigue, concentration) are additional enabling technologies for new application fields towards a quantified self for the mind. Smart eyewear and recognizing cognitive states go hand in hand, as naturally most research work in this field requires sensors. \n</li><li> Cognitive scientists and psychologists have now a better understanding of user behavior and what induces behavior change. Therefore, smart eyewear could help users in achieving behaviour change towards their long term goals. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nEyewear computing has the potential to fundamentally transform the way machines perceive and understand the world around us and to assist humans in measurably and significantly improved ways. The seminar brought together researchers from a wide range of computing disciplines, such as mobile and ubiquitous computing, head-mounted eye tracking, optics, computer vision, human vision and perception, privacy and security, usability, as well as systems research. Attendees discussed how smart eyewear can change existing research and how it may open up new research opportunities. For example, future research in this area could fundamentally change our understanding of how people interact with the world around them, how to augment these interactions, and may have a transformational impact on all spheres of life -- the workplace, family life, education, and psychological well-being.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andreas Bulling, Ozan Cakmakci, Kai Kunze, and James M.

            "title": "Cybersafety Threats \u2013 from Deception to Aggression",
            "data": "\n <p>\nA number of malicious activities are prospering online and are putting users at risk. In particular, cyber deception and cyber aggression practices are increasing their reach and seriousness, leading to a number of harmful practices such as phishing, disinformation, radicalization, and cyberbullying.\nAttack strategies include controlling and operating fake or compromised social media accounts, artificially manipulating the reputation of online entities, spreading false information, and manipulating users via psychological principles of influence into performing behaviors that are counter to their best interests and benefit the attackers.\n</p> \n <p>\nSo far, computer science research on cybersafety has looked at the various sub-problems in isolation, mostly relying on algorithms aimed at threat detection, and without considering the implications of the attacks and countermeasures for individual users as well as for society. On the other hand, human factors and social science researchers often consider user interfaces and social interactions without taking full advantage of the algorithmic, data-driven cybersafety research. Moreover, the legal and ethical implications of attacks and countermeasures are often unclear.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of the Dagstuhl Seminar 19302 \"Cybersafety Threats - from Deception to Aggression\" was to provide a platform for researchers to look at the problem of cybersafety from a holistic and multi-disciplinary perspective.\nThe participants were drawn from a number of disciplines such as computer science, criminology, psychology, and education, with the aim of developing new ideas to understand and mitigate the problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the beginning of the seminar, we asked participants to identify important themes to focus on, and these themes were refined through specific activities and discussions during the first day: Firstly, all participants gave 5-minute talks where they presented their current research related to the seminar, and their expectations and topics they would like to work on during the week. Secondly, we conducted three <em>introductory panels</em> on the topics of \n<em>Cyber Deception</em>, <em>Cyber Aggression</em> and <em>Propaganda &amp; Disinformation</em>. Each panel consisted of five participants. We took special care to represent different disciplines and different career stages in each panel.\n</p> \n <p>\nBy the beginning of the second day, participants had identified four key themes to study in this area, which we describe in detail in the rest of this section. The participants formed working groups (WGs) for each theme.\n</p> \n <h3>Theme 1: Attacker modeling</h3> \n <p>\nThe working group focused on predicting the next steps of an ongoing attack by means of a probabilistic model. The initial model developed by the group consists of 9 variables: attacker goals, characteristics of the attack (e.g., how long the attack takes, tools employed), consequences, authorization, attribution, expected resilience of the victim, expected characteristics of the victim from attacker's perspective, actual characteristics of the victim, actual responsiveness of the victim.\nThe developed model was verified and refined using two known attacks as case studies:  the Internet Worm (1988) and the  SpamHaus DDoS attack (2013).\n</p> \n <p>\nTwo most important next steps to refine the model are:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Convert the variables into measurable quantities\n </li><li> Obtain labeled data on which the model can be trained\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThe working group started working on a conceptual paper that describes the model, and discussed possible venues for its publication. Several methods of obtaining the data for the model were proposed, such as interviewing CISOs and other defenders, creating financial incentives for organization to share their data, and  organizing a stakeholder workshop including not only defenders, but also former attackers who now work as security consultants.\n</p> \n <h3>Theme 2: Unintended consequences of countermeasures</h3> \n <p>\nThis working group focused on an often overlooked aspect of computer security research: the fact that deploying any countermeasure to mitigate malicious online activity can have unexpected consequences and harms to other parties.\nThe members of this working group started by discussing a number of scenarios: intimate partner abuse, CEO fraud, disinformation, online dating fraud, and phishing, and developed a taxonomy of these potential harms.\nThe taxonomy takes into account not only technical issues that might arise from deploying countermeasures but also socio-technical ones such as the displacement effect of attackers moving to other victims, the additional costs incurred by using the countermeasure, and the issues arising from complacency, for example leaving users desensitized by displaying too many alerts to prevent a certain type of attack.\n</p> \n <h3>Theme 3: Measuring human behavior from information security (and societal) perspectives</h3> \n <p>\nMeasuring online behavior is of fundamental importance to gain an accurate understanding of malicious online activities such as cybercrime.\nThe research community, however, does not have well established techniques to accurately measure this behavior, and this can lead to studies presenting largely contradicting results.\nThis working group focused on identifying techniques relevant to measure and model various types of online behavior, from cyberbullying and disinformation to ransomware and phishing.\nAs a final outcome, the working group drafted two methodological frameworks for researchers aiming to study these problems, one focused on socio-technical threats (cyberbullying and disinformation) and one focused on cybersecurity (phishing and malware).\n</p> \n <h3>Theme 4: Prevention, detection, response and recovery.</h3> \n <p>\nA key challenge when mitigating socio-technical issues is developing the most effective countermeasures.\nThis group focused on developing detection and prevention approaches focusing on threats encountered by adolescents when surfing the Web (e.g., cybergrooming). A common issue here is that adolescents rarely turn to adults for help, and therefore any mitigation based on direct parental oversight has limited effectiveness. To go beyond these issues, the group developed a mitigation strategy based on a \"guardian angel\" approach. \nThe idea is to let a minor create a \"guardian avatar\"' that will then advise them on cybersafety practices, with a decreasing level of oversight as the minor grows up. While the children are very young, the guardian avatar will closely supervise them, reporting any suspicious contacts that they have online to a parent or a guardian.\nLater, as the child enters adolescence, the avatar will gradually take on an advisory role, eventually only providing advice once the adolescent asks for it.\nThe group considered privacy issues and interdisciplinary aspects related to psychology and education, and developed a proposal of how the avatar would work.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar produced a number of ideas on how to investigate and mitigate cybersafety threats. It enabled researchers from different disciplines to connect, and set the agenda for potentially impactful research to be carried out in the next years. Joint publications and funding for joint research were discussed in each WG and later in the plenum. For example, WG 3 considered possibilities for a large international grant, such as H2020.\nThe ideas produced as part of theme 4 resulted in the paper \"Identifying Unintended Harms of Cybersecurity Countermeasures\" to appear at the APWG eCrime Symposium in November 2019.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Zinaida Benenson, Marianne Junger, Daniela Oliveira, and Gianluca Stringhini\n                </div> \n",

Computational geometry is a vibrant and mature field of research, with several dedicated international conferences and journals and strong intellectual connections with other computing and mathematics disciplines.pagebreak\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Topics</h3> \n <p>\nThe emphasis of this seminar was on presenting recent developments in computational geometry, as well as identifying new challenges, opportunities, and connections to other fields of computing. In addition to the usual broad coverage of new results in the field, the seminar included broad survey talks on algebraic methods in computational geometry as well as geometric data structures. The former focus area has seen exciting recent progress and the latter is a fundamental topic at the heart of computational geometry. There are numerous opportunities for further cross-disciplinary impact.\n</p> \n <h4>Algebraic Methods in Computational Geometry</h4> \n <p>\nThe polynomial method of Guth and Katz of 2010 has had a fundamental impact on discrete geometry and other areas, which was already envisioned by the talk of Jir\u00ed Matou\u0161ek at the Annual European Workshop on Computational Geometry in 2011, four years before he passed away. Indeed, the polynomial method has attracted the attention of many researchers, including famous ones like Janos Pach, Micha Sharir, and Terence Tao. Applications have been found not only in making progress on long-standing combinatorial geometry problems, but also in the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for fundamental geometric problems such as range searching, approximate nearest search, diameter, etc. The polynomial method is very powerful and it offers a new research direction in which many interesting new results can potentially be discovered.\n</p> \n <h4>Geometric Data Structures</h4> \n <p> \nMany beautiful results in geometric data structures have been established in the early days of the field. Despite of this, some long-standing problems remain unresolved and some of the recent progress is in fact made using the polynomial method mentioned previously. Independently, there have been some recent advances in our understanding of lower bounds and the usage of more sophisticated combinatorial constructions and techniques such as shallow cuttings, optimal partition trees, discrete Voronoi diagrams, etc. There are also new applications that require the modeling of uncertain data and hence call for a study of the performance of geometric data structures under a stochastic setting.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Siu-Wing Cheng, Anne Driemel, and Jeff Erickson\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h3>Description of the seminar</h3> \n <p>\nOne-dimensional objects embedded in higher-dimensional spaces are one of the most natural phenomena we encounter: ranging from DNA strands to roads to planetary orbits, they occur at all granularities throughout the sciences. \nComputer-assisted analysis of one-dimensional data is now standard procedure in many sciences; yet the underlying mathematics are not always well understood, preventing the most powerful analytical tools from being used.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdding to the confusion, one-dimensional objects are studied under different names in different areas of mathematics and computer science (knots, curves, paths, traces, trajectories). In mathematics, 1-dimensional objects are well-understood, and research endeavors have moved on to higher dimensions.\nOn the other hand, many fundamental applications demand solutions that deal with 1-dimensional objects, and these computational problems have largely been studied in separate communities by those unaware of all of the mathematical foundations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of the proposed seminar was to identify connections and seed new research collaborations along the spectrum from knot theory and topology, to computational topology and computational geometry, all the way to graph drawing. Each of the invited speakers explored synergies in algorithms concerning 1-dimensional objects embedded in 2- and 3-dimensional spaces, as this is both the most fundamental setting in many applications, as well as the setting where the discrepancy in computational complexity between generic mathematical theory and potential algorithmic solutions is most apparent.\nIn addition, each talk proposed a set of open questions from their research area that could benefit from attention from the other communities, and participants of the seminar were invited to propose their own research questions.  \n</p> \n <p>\nBelow, we (the organizers) briefly describe the three main areas bridged; the abstracts of talks in the seminar and preliminary results from the working groups are also outlined later in this report.  \n</p> \n <h3>Curves in Trajectory Analysis</h3> \n <p>Applications of computational topology are on the rise; examples include the analysis of GIS data, medical image analysis, graphics and image modeling, and many others.  Despite how fundamental the question of topological equivalence is in mathematics, many of the relatively simple settings needed in computational settings (such as the plane or a 2-manifold) have been less examined in mathematics, where computability is known but optimizing algorithms in such \"easy\" settings has not been of interest until relatively recently.  \n</p> \n <p>\nHomotopy is one of the most fundamental problems to consider in a topological space, as this measure captures continuous deformation between objects.  However, homotopy is notoriously difficult, as  even deciding if two curves are homotopic is undecidable in a generic 2-complex.  Nonetheless, many application settings provide restrictions that make computation more accessible.  For example, most GIS applications return trajectories in a planar setting, at which point finding optimal homotopies (for some definition of optimal) becomes tractable.\n</p> \n <p>\nHomology has been more recently pursued, as finding good homologies reduces to a linear algebra problem which can be solved efficiently.  An example of this in the 1-dimensional setting is the recent work by Pokorny  on clustering trajectories based on relative persistent homology. However, it is not always clear that optimal homologies provide as intuitive a notion for similarity measures compared with homotopy, and further investigations into applications settings is necessary.\n</p> \n <h3>Curves in Knot Theory</h3> \n <p>A fundamental question in 3-manifold topology is the problem of isotopy.  Testing if two curves are ambiently isotopic is a foundational problem of <em>knot theory</em>: essentially, this asks whether two knots in 3-space are topologically equivalent. Problems in knot theory are tightly related to problems in 3-manifold topology, a field that has seen major breakthroughs in\nrecent years, including Perelman's 2002 solution to the geometrisation\nand Poincar\u00e9 conjectures, and Agol's recent 2012 proof of the\nvirtual Haken conjecture. Algorithms and computation in these fields are\nnow receiving significant attention from both mathematicians and computer scientists.\n</p> \n <p>\nComplexity results are surprisingly difficult to come by. For example, one of the most fundamental and best-known problems is detecting whether a curve is knotted. This is known to be in both NP and co-NP; the former result was shown by Hass, Lagarias and Pippenger in 1999, but the latter was proven unconditionally by Lackenby just this year. Finding a polynomial time algorithm remains a major open problem. Hardness results are known for some knot invariants, but (despite being widely expected) no hardness result is known for the general problem of testing two knots for equivalence. Techniques such as randomisation and parameterised complexity are now emerging as fruitful methods for understanding the inherent difficulty of these problems at a deeper level.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlgorithmically, many fundamental problems in knot theory are solved by\ntranslating to 3-manifold topology.  Here there have been great strides\nin practical software in recent years: software packages such as\n<em>SnapPy</em> and <em>Regina</em> are now extremely effective in practice for\nmoderate-sized problems, and have become core tools in the\nmathematical research process. Nevertheless, their underlying algorithms have significant limitations: <em>SnapPy</em> is based on numerical methods that can lead to numerical instability, and <em>Regina</em> is based on polytope algorithms that can suffer from combinatorial explosions. It is now a major question as to how to design algorithms for knots and\n3-manifolds that are exact, implementable, and have provably viable\nworst-case analyses.\n</p> \n <h3>Curves in Graph Drawing</h3> \n <p>On the computer science end of the spectrum, the study of one-dimensional objects is closely related to Graph Drawing.\n</p> \n <p>\nGraph Drawing studies the embedding of zero- and one-dimensional features (vertices and edges of graphs) into higher-dimensional spaces; both from an analytic (given an embedding, what can we say about it) and synthetic (come up with a good embedding) point of view. Computational questions (how can we embed a given graph such that it satisfies certain properties / optimises certain criteria) and fundamental questions (which classes of graphs admit which styles of embeddings) have been studied extensively, and a large body of algorithmic results is readily available.\n</p> \n <p>\nPlanarity (non-crossing edges) is a central theme in graph drawing. There is a rich literature discussing which graphs can be drawn planarly, when, and how, as well as how to avoid crossings or other undesirable features in a drawing, such as non-rational vertices. Traditionally, edges have always been embedded as straight line segments; however, there is a recent trend to consider different shapes and curves, drastically increasing the space of possible drawings of a graph. The potential benefits of this broader spectrum are obvious, but the effects (both computational and fundamental) are still ill understood.\n</p> \n <p>\nConnections between graph drawing and knot theory have long been recognised, yet are still being actively explored. Already in 1983, Conway and Gordon showed that every spatial representation of K_7 contains at least one knotted Hamiltonian cycle. Based on this, in 2013, Politano and Rowland characterised which knots appear as Hamiltonian cycles in canonical book embeddings of complete graphs (as defined by Otsuki in 1996).\n</p> \n <h3>Goals and Results of this Seminar</h3> \n <p>Now is an exciting time for computational and algorithmic knot theory:\npractical algorithms are showing their potential through experimentation and computer-assisted proofs, and we are now seeing key breakthroughs in our understanding of the complex relationships between knot theory and computability and complexity theory. Early interactions between mathematicians and computer scientists in these areas have proven extremely fruitful,\nand as these interactions deepen it is hoped that major unsolved problems\nin the field will come within reach.\n</p> \n <p>\nSimilarly, applications for graph drawing and trajectory analysis are in great demand, especially given the rise of massive amounts of data through GIS systems, map analysis, and many other application areas.  However, despite the fact that many problems on curves are seen as mathematically trivial, there are few CS researchers who are truly familiar with the deeper topological results from mathematics.  It is likely that many algorithmically interesting questions can benefit from an understanding of this rich history and toolset.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought together a group of researchers from computer science and mathematics that study algorithms and mathematical properties of curves in various settings, as the interplay between these two groups is recent.  In addition, we  invited researchers in applications domains, who often do heuristic analysis of 1-dimensional objects in a variety of settings.  \nWorking groups were formed organically, but often allowed participants from various subfields to swap both open problems and favorite tools, and the overview talks discussed favorite tools and techniques from subdomains that may be useful to those in other areas. Concretely, we hope that in addition to the work begun in the working groups, many of these new collaborations will have positive long-term effects on all areas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Benjamin Burton, Maarten L\u00f6ffler, Carola Wenk, and Erin Moriarty Wolf Chambers\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nSeveral large-scale Internet measurement platforms have been deployed during the last years in order to understand how the Internet is performing, to observe how it is evolving, and to determine where failures or degradations occur. Examples are the CAIDA Archipelago (Ark) platform [6] (used for Internet topology discovery and detecting congestion on interdomain links), the SamKnows platform [4] (used by regulators and network operators to study network performance), the RIPE Atlas platform [3, 5] (that provides measurement services to network operators and researchers), the Netradar system [8] (for performing wireless\nperformance measurements), and the BISmark project [9]. European collaborative research incorporate measurement results into network management systems (e.g., Leone) [2]. Related projects (e.g., Flamingo) [1] are increasingly working with measurement data from these platforms. Large-scale measurements are meanwhile also used to drive network operations or to dynamically adjust how services are delivered to customers. Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers use measurement data to optimize content caches and to tune load balancing algorithms. One key challenge is that global Internet measurement systems can generate large amounts of data that need to be processed to derive relevant information.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar (#16012) was a followup of the Dagstuhl seminar on Global Measurement Frameworks (#13472) [7]. The main focus of the first seminar was an exchange of ideas on the development of global measurement infrastructures, frameworks and associated metrics. Some of this work is now further pursued in standardization bodies [4] such as the IETF Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working group and the Broadband Forum. The goal of this followup seminar was to focus on the experience obtained with different\nmetrics, tools, and data analysis techniques. It provided a forum for researchers to exchange their experience with different practices to conduct global measurements. The aim was to identify what works well in certain contexts, what has proven problematic in other contexts, and identify open issues that need further research. The seminar approached this by looking\nat three distinct dimensions: (a) Measurement metrics, (b) data processing technologies and (c) data analysis methodologies. Some key questions were:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Which metrics have been found useful for measuring Quality of Experience (QoE) of certain classes of services? Which metrics have been found problematic? Is it possible to find indicators for good metrics and problematic metrics?\n</li><li> Which technologies have been found useful for storing and processing large amounts of measurement data? Which technologies were found to be problematic? Are there new promising technologies that may be used in the future? What are the specific requirements for dealing with large-scale measurement data and how do they relate to or differ from other big data applications?\n</li><li> Which data analysis techniques have been found to be useful? Which data analysis techniques have been found to be problematic? Are there any novel promising techniques that need further research and development?\n</li></ol> \n <p>Although at the seminar the participants chose to organize the discussions on more general topics than these specific questions, during the discussions most of these questions\nwere addressed to one degree or another.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Flamingo \u2013 Management of the Future Internet. http://www.fp7-flamingo.eu.

            "title": "Secure Routing for the Internet",
            "data": "\n <p>The seminar was focused on the following aspects of routing security, mostly in the context of traditional inter-domain routing security: \n(i) Protocol design vs tooling, \n(ii) sources of relevant routing data and their accuracy/collection challenges, including policy databases,\n(iii) the need for metadata and dataset ``labelling'',\n(iv) monitoring and detection of routing attacks and anomalous incidents, such as BGP hijacks and route leaks,\nincentives for network operators to adopt routing security protocols,\n(v) testbeds for routing experiments, \n(vi) hijacks as enabling attacks against ToR and Bitcoin, on the application level,\n(vii) prevention of routing attacks,\n(viii) anonymity, privacy and (anti-)censorship. \nMoreover, we discussed in depth about (ix) PKI and cryptographic verification and protection mechanisms, and their use in securing routing infrastructures, such as the RPKI and BGPsec protocols. Finally, we (x) approached BGP flowspecs, DDoS attacks and QoS in the Internet as separate topics of interest in the field.\nAnother goal of the seminar was to touch upon (xi) future network routing architectures which offer routing security ``by design'', especially in light of demanding upcoming applications such as IoT, car-to-car communications, sensor swarms, and wireless routing at scale, and identify related security and privacy concerns and objectives.\n</p> \n <p>\nBesides the specific goals of the seminar, it is also worth noting some interesting aspects of Dagstuhl seminars in general, that played a critical role in fueling the related talks, discussions and reports. In summary, the 3-day seminar in which we participated, focused not solely on the presentation of established results but also on ideas, sketches, and open (research and operations) problems. The pace and program was guided by topics and presentations that evolved through discussions. This report contains an executive summary of the material that was transcribed during the entire seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, some participants of the seminar seem to be more \"pessimistic\" about routing security. Both the research and operator communities need to consolidate more data sources to facilitate progress. Any deployment progress is only possible if operator incentives are improved, however, it remains an open problem on how to provide strong incentives. In practice, a good technical solution is insufficient without first tackling the \"politics\". We discussed about routing/network testbeds and the role they can play in emulating and verifying many of the discussed concepts. However, in the wild (or the \"real world\"), it is surprisingly hard to implement something like RPKI; even more so for BGPsec. We all need a better understanding of the problem space; formal taxonomies of routing attacks, such as hijacks, would be of great help on this front. Regarding improving BGP itself, we have seen many prevention mechanisms, whose deployment is the end-goal for the Internet. However, as we have to live with BGP at least in the intermediate term, we can also explore research on overlay solutions to achieve the properties that we need, at least for the time being. These solutions need to support incremental deployment for obvious reasons.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn general, deployment progress has been slow which is feared not change in the near future. It is reassuring to see that a lot of work is being done in the measurement area; we were also reminded how hard is it to get the ground truth, labelled with useful metadata. Some fundamentally new and secure approaches were discussed, for instance the SCION secure Internet architecture, however, the deployment of new inter-domain routing protocols is very challenging. To improve the deployment incentives of secure routing protocols for operators, the creation of a catalog of routing incidents could be beneficial.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, it seems that the community may have underestimated the importance of monitoring tools and their utility in the wild.\nWe have learned about new data sets, as well as interesting insights on the Impact of prefix hijacks on the application layer.\nIn general though, we were hoping to see more enthusiasm for new solutions.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, it is worth noting that having a mixed group of researchers and operators is very important to exchange information and discuss potential approaches, which made the seminar an interesting and worthwhile experience.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Vasileios Kotronis\n                </div> \n",

The semantics of\nmainstream low-level languages like C and C++ is inherently\ninsecure, and even for safer languages, establishing security with\nrespect to a high-level semantics does not prevent devastating\nlow-level attacks. In particular, all the abstraction and security\nguarantees of the source language are currently lost when interacting\nwith lower-level code, for instance when using low-level\nlibraries. For a concrete example, all modern languages provide a notion of\nstructured control flow and an invoked procedure is expected to return\nto the right place. However, today's compilation chains (compilers,\nlinkers, loaders, runtime systems, hardware) cannot efficiently\nenforce this abstraction: linked low-level code can call and return to\narbitrary instructions or smash the stack, blatantly violating the\nhigh-level abstraction.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Secure compilation</b> is an emerging field that puts together advances in\nsecurity, programming languages, compilers, verification, systems, and\nhardware architectures in order to devise secure compiler chains that\neliminate many of today's low-level vulnerabilities. Secure\ncompilation aims to protect high-level language abstractions in\ncompiled code, even against low-level attacks, and to\nallow sound reasoning about security in the source language. The\nemerging secure compilation community aims to achieve this by:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Identifying and formalizing secure compilation criteria and\n  attacker models.</b> What are the properties we want secure compilers to have, and under what attacker models? Should a secure compilation chain preserve observational equivalence of programs? Should it preserve some class\nof security properties of the source programs? Should it guarantee\ninvariants on the run-time state of the compiled program (like for\ninstance well-formedness of the call-stack)? And what are realistic\nattacker models? Can attackers only interact with compiled programs by\nproviding input and reading output? Or can they link arbitrary\nlow-level code to the program? Well-studied notions like fully abstract\ncompilation provide partial answers: a fully abstract compiler chain\npreserves observational equivalence under an attacker model where\nattackers are target-level contexts. Even where this is the\ndesired end-to-end security goal, it can still be too hard to enforce,\nfor instance in cases where target level contexts can measure time.\n\n</li><li><b>Efficient enforcement mechanisms.</b> The main reason today's\ncompiler chains are not secure is that enforcing abstractions in low-level compiled code can be very inefficient. In order to overcome this problem, the secure compilation community is investigating various efficient security enforcement mechanisms: from the use of static checking of low-level code to rule out linking with ill-behaved contexts, to software rewriting\n(e.g., software fault isolation), dynamic monitoring, and randomization. One key enabler is that hardware support for security is steadily increasing.\n\n</li><li><b>Developing effective formal verification techniques.</b> Secure\ncompilation properties like full abstraction are generally much harder to prove\nthan compiler correctness. Intuitively, in order to show full\nabstraction one has to be able to back-translate any low-level context\nattacking the compiled code to an equivalent high-level context that\ncan attack the original source code. This back-translation is,\nhowever, nontrivial, and while several proof techniques have been\nproposed (e.g., based on logical relations, bisimulations, game\nsemantics, multi-language semantics, embedded interpreters, etc.),\nscaling these techniques to realistic secure compilers is a\nchallenging research problem. This challenge becomes even more\npronounced if one expects a strong level of assurance, as provided by\nformal verification using a proof assistant.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\n<b>The Secure Compilation Dagstuhl Seminar 18201</b> attracted a large\nnumber of excellent researchers with diverse backgrounds. The 45 participants represented the programming languages, formal verification, security, and systems communities, which led to many interesting points of view and enriching discussions. Some of these discussions were ignited by the \"guided discussions\" on the 3 aspects above and by the 35 talks contributed by the participants. The contributed talks spanned a very large number of topics:\ninvestigating various secure compilation criteria and attacker models,\nbuilding prototype secure compilation chains, proposing different enforcement techniques, studying the relation to verified compilation and compositional compiler correctness, specifying and restricting undefined behavior,\nprotecting against side-channels, studying intermediate representations,\nperforming translation validation, securing multi-language interoperability,\ncontrolling information-flow, compartmentalizing software, enforcing memory safety, compiling constant-time cryptography, securing compiler optimizations,\ndesigning more secure (domain-specific) languages, enforcing security policies,\nformally specifying the semantics of realistic languages and ISAs,\ncompartmentalization, capability machines, tagged architectures, integrating with existing compilation chains like LLVM, making exploits more difficult by diversification, multi-language interoperability, etc.\nTalks were interspersed with lively discussions, since by default each speaker could only use half of the time for presenting and had to use the other half for answering questions and engaging with the audience.\n</p> \n <p>Given the high interest spurred by this first edition and the positive\nfeedback received afterwards, we believe that this Dagstuhl Seminar\nshould be repeated in the future.\nParticular aspects that could still be improved in future editions is\nfocusing more on secure compilation and spurring more participation\nfrom the practical security and systems communities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Amal Ahmed, Deepak Garg, Catalin Hritcu, and Frank Piessens\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Voting: Beyond Simple Majorities and Single-Winner Elections",
            "data": "\n <p>\nComputational social choice is an interdisciplinary field of research,\nfocused on the issue of aggregating preferences of agents--perhaps\nself-interested and strategic -- and providing them with joint decisions.\nComputational social choice combines the tools and approaches of social\nchoice theory, computer science (with particular focus on artificial\nintelligence and theoretical computer science), economics, political\nscience, and operations research. The distinctive feature of computational\nsocial choice--as opposed to the classic social choice theory -- is that\ncomputational considerations (e.g., efficiency of computing outcomes of the\npreference aggregation processes) are given significant attention. Further,\nresearchers working on computational social choice often study virtual\nelections where either people vote through electronic means (such as in\nDoodle polls for scheduling of meetings) or the elections are used as a tool\nand the votes are derived automatically in some way (e.g., voting can be\nused as a selection procedure in a genetic algorithm). Nonetheless, the two\nresearch areas are deeply connected and there is significant interaction\nbetween them.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the most classic problems studied within (computational) social\nchoice regards conducting a single-winner election. For example, consider\nthe situation where members of some society wish to choose their president.\nThey collect the set of candidates (who usually have to register well ahead\nof time, typically by gathering necessary popular support), then the\ncandidates run their campaigns, argue who would be the best president, air\ncommercials, etc. Eventually, the voters form their preferences (either they\nsimply decide who would be the best president, or they form rankings of the\ncandidates, or they decide on a set of acceptable presidents, depending on\nthe voting rule used) and, on the election day, they cast their votes. In\nthe end, an electoral commission gathers the votes and applies an agreed\nupon voting rule to decide who would be the next president.\n</p> \n <p>\nDue to the fantastic progress in social choice (since the middle of the\ntwentieth century) and in computational social choice (over the last fifteen\nyears or so), essentially all the stages of the above-described process are\nquite well understood. However, In the modern world -- especially in the era\nof ubiquitous use of social media -- it appears that there is a great range\nof preference aggregation settings where the classic approach falls short.\nFor example, consider a situation where a company wants to hire a team of\nspecialists. There may be quite a large number of possible candidates to\nemploy (as opposed to the few candidates in a typical presidential\nelection), each of the candidates may have quite different skills and\nabilities, various employees may either complement each other or be\ncounter-productive if teamed up (as opposed to our presidential election,\nwhere we pick a single person for the whole task). Finally, the recruiting\ncommittee typically consists of just a few people (few voters, as opposed to\nthe millions of people voting for presidents), but their preferences might\nhave a very involved structure (for example, if we hire a specialist in X\nthen we also need a specialist in Y, but otherwise a specialist in Z\nwould suffice; on top of that, each member of the recruitment committee may\njudge candidates' abilities differently).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of the seminar was to bring together researchers who work on\nvarious aspects of aggregation problems that go beyond the classic\nhigh-stake, rarely conducted, single-winner elections, and to discuss the\nfollowing issues:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Scenarios with multiple winners and/or settings where each aggregation\noutcome may consist of separate entities (e.g., multi-winner elections and\nsingle-winner elections in combinatorial domains).\n\n</li><li> Various non-typical ways of expressing preferences, going from\n(variants of) non-binary preferences to settings where the agents can\nexpress complex statements, including conditional ones (e.g., CP-nets).\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThe seminar also dealt with some real-world applications, such the question\nof drawing constituency boundaries in the United States of America or the\nchoice of the voting rule in EU Council of Ministers.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together 42 researchers from 14 countries, working in\nartificial intelligence, theoretical computer science, mathematics,\neconomics, social choice, and political science. Discussions regarding the\nnew challenges in the area of preference aggregation should fertilize\nresearch in all these areas.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe technical program of the seminar was structured over five working\ngroups. On the first day the participants were invited to give 5-minute\npresentations of research topics that they found interesting and, based on\nthose presentations, the organizers suggested five working groups:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Working Group 1: Voting Experiments. \n\n</li><li> Working Group 2: Understanding Diversity in Multiwinner Elections.\n\n</li><li> Working Group 3: Aggregation Procedures with Nonstandard Input and Output Types. \n\n</li><li> Working Group 4: Voting in Larger Contexts.\n\n</li><li> Working Group 5: Proportionality in Multiwinner Elections.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar attendees accepted these groups and each chose one to\nparticipate in the discussions. During the seminar each group met twice for\nextended discussions. Also, one afternoon was free for unstructured\ndiscussions (of which many were used for in-depth discussions of topics\ninitiated during the working group discussions). Finally, on the last day of\nthe seminar representatives of each group presented the results of their\ndiscussions (which ranged from making actual technical contributions to\npresenting research agendas for future work). The working groups\nwere supported by 21 regular scientific presentations, and extended\npresentation of the real-life experiments regarding French presidential\nelections, and 6 survey talks.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar acknowledged that there are new, exciting research topics\nregarding computational social choice. In particular, multiwinner elections\nwere represented very prominently and it became clear that work on them has\nonly started. We hope and believe that one of the effects of the seminar was\nconvincing many more people (also outside of the core computational social\nchoice community) that studying more general forms of elections (such as\nmultiwinner elections, or elections with nonstandard input formats) is\nimportant and promising.\n</p> \n <p>\nGiven the personal feedback we received, we believe that the participants\nwere very happy with the setting of working groups (from the process of\nforming them based on surveyed interest, through actual meetings, to\npresentation of results). We also receive very strong, positive feedback\nregarding leaving one afternoon unstructured, for the participants to use as\nthey preferred. We have seen many ad-hoc discussions, meetings of coauthors,\nand problem-solving sessions. Indeed, it seems that for seminars with\nwell-established communities, such an unstructured afternoon is far more\nuseful than the traditional excursion (which, on the other hand, seems to be\nvery effective for not as well-established communities).\n</p> \n <p>\nWe are very grateful to all the participants for their contributions, ideas,\nand discussions, which made this seminar truly enjoyable. We would also like\nto thank the Schloss Dagstuhl team for their support and excellent\norganization and patience.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Dorothea Baumeister, Piotr Faliszewski, and Annick Laruelle\n                </div> \n",

This Dagstuhl Seminar covered a range of related topics, which we summarize as follows.\n</p> \n <h4>Efficient NLP models</h4> \n <p>\nA key method for mitigating the raised concerns is reducing costs by making models more efficient. We surveyed the different methods that exist for making NLP technology more efficient. We discussed their tradeoffs, prioritized them, and aimed to identify new opportunities to promote efficiency in NLP. During the seminar, we drafted a survey paper summarizing multiple methods for increasing the efficiency of NLP models. We aim to publish this work later this year.\n</p> \n <h4>Systemic issues</h4> \n <p>\nWe also addressed systemic issues in the field relating to the reporting of computational budgets in NLP research, and how we can use incentive structures such as the NLP Reproducibility Checklist [1] to motivate researchers throughout the field to improve reporting. We discussed the survey responses for the reproducibility checklist used at four major NLP conferences, and we plan to release a report of this data.\n</p> \n <h4>Equity of access</h4> \n <p>\nA third topic of discussion was the equity of access to computational resources and state-of-the-art NLP technologies. Prior to the seminar, we conducted a survey of different stakeholders across the NLP community. During the seminar, we analyzed and discussed the results of this survey to better understand who is most affected and how, and developed informed strategies and policies to mitigate this inequity moving forward. We are currently working on a paper summarizing the results of this survey, which we hope to publish later this year.\n</p> \n <h4>Measuring efficiency and equity</h4> \n <p>\nAll of the above endeavors require establishing the right metrics and standards to measure our current status and progress towards efficiency and equity goals. We discussed multiple metrics and evaluation frameworks that capture the bigger picture of how different approaches compare in terms of energy efficiency not just in the research environment but in practice and over the entire ML model lifecycle (development, training and deployment), and that work under a wide range of computational budgets.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Jesse Dodge, Suchin Gururangan, Dallas Card, Roy Schwartz, Noah A.

            "title": "Parameterized Complexity in Graph Drawing",
            "data": "\n <p>\n<b>Graph Drawing.</b> Graph-based models are pervasive in many fields of science and technology. Very often scientists and users analyze these models and communicate their findings by means of graphical representations. This motivated the birth and evolution of graph drawing, a self-standing discipline that has evolved tremendously over the past 50 years. Today graph drawing is a mature area of computer science [5, 13, 17, 18] with its own annual conference, the  international Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD). The\nfocus of the research area today is on combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of drawing graphs as well as on the design of network visualization systems and interfaces. Graph drawing is motivated by applications where it is crucial to visually analyze and interact with relational datasets. Examples of such application areas include data science, social sciences, web computing, information systems, biology, geography, business intelligence, information\nsecurity and software engineering.\n</p> \n <p>\nRoughly speaking, graph drawing deals with the construction and analysis of geometric representations of graphs and networks subject to specific layout conventions, such as different notions of planarity or more general crossing constraints, grid layouts, orthogonal drawings etc. Many classic graph drawing problems are NP-hard and thus a variety of theoretical and practical algorithmic techniques for dealing with hard problems are required in graph drawing.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Parameterized Complexity.</b> Numerous computational problems of wide interest are known to be NP-hard in general. Yet, it is often possible to utilize the structure implicitly underlying many real-world instances to find exact solutions efficiently. There is long-standing systematic research of tractability results for various problems on specific classes of instances, and research in this direction constitutes one of the fundamental areas of computer science. However, in many real-world situations it is not possible to define a clear-cut class of instances that we wish to solve; instead of being black and white (belonging to a specific class or not), instances often come in various shades of grey (having certain degrees of internal structure).\n</p> \n <p>The relatively young <em>parameterized complexity</em> paradigm [6, 4, 8, 16] offers the perfect tools to deal with this situation. In the parameterized setting, we associate each instance with a numerical <em>parameter</em>, which captures how \u201cstructured\u201d the instance is. This then allows the development of  algorithms whose performance strongly depends on the parameter \u2013 instead\nof the classical setting, where we often associate tractability with polynomial running times and intractability with superpolynomial ones, parameterized algorithms naturally \u201cscale\u201d with the amount of structure contained in the instance. The central notion of tractability in the parameterized setting is <em>fixed-parameter tractable</em> (FPT in short), which means that the given problem can be solved by an algorithm with runtime of the form <em>f(k) \u00b7 nO(1)</em> (where <em>f</em> is an arbitrary computable function, <em>k</em> is the value of the parameter, and <em>n</em> is the input size). Aside from fixed-parameter tractability, the parameterized complexity landscape consists of a variety of companion notions such as XP-<em>tractability, kernelization</em> and W-<em>hardness</em>.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Parameterized Complexity in Graph Drawing.</b> Research at the intersection of graph drawing and parameterized complexity (and parameterized algorithms in particular) is in its infancy. Most of the early efforts have been directed at variants of the classic Crossing Minimization problem, introduced by Tur\u00e1n in 1940 [19], parameterized by the number of crossings. Here, the objective is to draw a given graph in the plane so as to induce minimum number of crossings. Already in 2001, it was shown to be FPT [9]. A few subsequent works followed\n[14, 11], including the best paper of GD 2019 [12], but also concerning restricted layouts such as two-layered embeddings [7] and two-sided circular graph layouts [15]. On a related note, given a graph drawn in the plane, some preliminary works considered the detection of a subgraph having a particular structure with minimum number of crossings [1, 10]. Recently, parameterized analysis of specific embeddings such as book embeddings [3, 2], was also\nbrought into life. Overall, the intersection of graph drawing and parameterized complexity still remains mostly unexplored, yet we see many interesting challenges and opportunities for taking a parameterized perspective on graph drawing problems and investigating the applicability of advanced parameterized techniques.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Goals</h3> \n <p>\nThe main goal of the seminar was to chart new paths towards research combining the latest findings and techniques in parameterized complexity and graph drawing. In particular, the  seminar focused on several prominent topics in graph drawing as well as state-of-the-art tools in parameterized complexity. The discussions addressed both concrete open problems as well as general directions for future research. An integral part of these discussions was the identification and formulation of major challenges as well as novel parameterizations of graph drawing problems relevant to parameterized analysis. The discussions also addressed the applicability of classic as well as cutting-edge tools in parameterized complexity to graph drawing.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn view of the above, it is safe to say that the selection of suitable problems to target was of great importance for the success of the seminar. Our main aim was to offer the participants the opportunity to propose problems to work on, and so the final selection of problems targeted by working groups was carried out during the seminar itself. That being said, we have also prepared a list of candidate problems that we believe would be prime candidates for further investigation through the lens of parameterized complexity.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>On the first day of the seminar we enjoyed short introductions of all participants, and four invited overview lectures on different research domains within Graph Drawing. The topics and speakers were chosen as to create a joint understanding of the state of the art of problems in Graph Drawing suitable for parameterized anaylsis. Thekla Hamm presented the topic of graph drawing extension problems, Petr Hlin\u011bn\u00fd presented the topic of planar insertion problems, Michael Kaufmann presented the topic of graph drawing beyond planarity and parametrized complexity, and Ignaz Rutter presented the topic\nof constrained embedding problems. More information on each lecture can be found in Section 3. Overall, this day prepared the ground for the open problem session on the second day.\n</li><li>The open problem session took place in the morning of the second day of the seminar. In this session, we collected a list of open research problems that were contributed by the seminar participants. In a preference voting we determined the five topics that raised the most interest among the participants and formed small working groups around them. Each group contained experts in both Graph Drawing and Parameterized Complexity. During the following days the groups worked by themselves, except for a few plenary reporting sessions, formalizing and solving their respective challenges. Below is a list of\nthe working group topics; more detailed group reports are found in Section 5.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Upward/level planarity:</b> This group studied two previously established restrictions of drawing planar graphs: vertices are either assigned a \u201chorizontal level\u201d that they must be placed on, or there are directed arcs and the drawing must have all edges facing upwards. The group aimed at the development of new parameterized algorithms for both of these NP-hard problems.\n</li><li><b>Two-page embeddings of upward planar graphs:</b> The group studied the complexity of recognizing whether st-planar graphs admit an upward two-page book embedding.\n</li><li><b> Orthogonal drawings:</b> The group focused on the Compaction problem (computing a minimum-area drawing for an orthogonal graph), parameterized primarily by the number of kitty corners, that is, pairs of reflex vertices that point to each other.\n</li><li><b>Almost Separated Fixed Order Stack Layouts:</b> In a fixed order stack layout the vertices of a graph are given with a fixed order and one has to assign the edges to pages so that no two edges on any page cross. This group studied a variant of this well-known NP-complete problem, where the graph is bipartite and the vertices form k consecutive blocks from either part.\n</li><li><b> Graph product structure theorem:</b> The group considered strong products of graphs that yield supergraphs of k-planar graphs, i.e. of graphs that admit a drawing in the plane in which each edge is crossed at most k times. The objective is to exploit these products to derive new upper bounds on the queue number of k-planar graphs.\n</li><li><b> Decision trees:</b> Decision Trees are well known tools used to describe, classify, and generalize data. Besides their simplicity, decision trees are particularly attractive for providing interpretable models of the underlying data. The group studied the complexity of learning decision trees of minimum size under several different parameterizations.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>After the open problem session, Robert Ganian gave a tutorial in the second day of the seminar that showcased how some of the tools in Parameterized Complexity can be applied to difficult problems, with a special focus on problems that are relevant to graph drawing. The tutorial was prepared in a way so as to make it accessible to the graph drawing community, acting as catalysis for progress on the five selected topics.\n</li><li> In the rest of the second day and the other days of the seminar, we had a flexible working schedule with a short plenary session every morning to accommodate group reports and impromptu presentations by participants.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Future Plans</h3> \n <p>The seminar was designed to foster new research collaborations between researchers in the graph drawing and parameterized complexity communities, whose paths rarely cross in the traditional conferences. These collaborations are very likely to result in new breakthroughs and results, and we expect that the seminar will lead to tangible progress in our understanding of problems of interest. In this sense, the primary outcome from the seminar will be research\npapers published at the core conferences and journals for the graph drawing and parameterized complexity communities, such as:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The International Symposium on Computational Geometry (<b>SoCG</b>),\n</li><li>The International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (<b>GD</b>),\n</li><li>The ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (<b>SODA</b>), and\n</li><li>The International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (<b>STACS</b>).\n</li></ul> \n <p>In the mid- and long-term horizon, the seminar will also help build a bridge between the two communities and identify other interesting graph drawing problems which would benefit from a rigorous investigation using tools from parameterized complexity. It can also lead to the development of new parameterized tools and techniques that are designed to deal with the specific obstacles that arise when trying to apply parameterized approaches in the graph drawing setting. Last but not least, the seminar will raise the awareness for\nthe typical research problems and the latest techniques in each others community and thus enrich the knowledge and toolbox of individual participants.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Dagstuhl seminar in 2022/2023 on Graph Drawing in Parameterized Complexity.</b> This Dagstuhl seminar has revealed, for the first time in a systematic way, the astounding wealth of problems in Graph Drawing that are naturally multivariate and hence suitable for parameterized analysis; thus a follow-up Dagstuhl seminar will be proposed to further discuss and deepen our understanding of this topic whose full potential is yet to be unlocked,\nonce again bringing together researchers in Graph Drawing and Parameterized Complexity.\n</p> \n <h3>Evaluation</h3> \n <p>According to the Dagstuhl survey conducted after the seminar, as well as informal feedback to the organizers, the seminar was highly appreciated. Particularly the small group size, group composition, and the seminar structure focusing on hands-on working groups was very well received. The seminar\u2019s goals to identify new research directions and initiate collaborations at the  intersection of the two different fields of Graph Drawing and Parameterized Complexity was very successful (also in comparison to other Dagstuhl seminars). Indeed, the participants rated the seminar highly for the mixture of these two fields and its productive interdisciplinary atmosphere, yielding new research perspectives, which have also resulted in new collaborations, joint projects and publications. We are looking forward to seeing the first scientific outcomes of the seminar in the near future and to continuing the efforts to support the growth of interest in parameterized analysis of problems in Graph Drawing. The seminar had more participants from the Graph Drawing community than from the Parameterized Complexity community due to critical uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that the current trend of improvement in the situation will help in composing a more balanced list of participants in future seminars on this topic.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>Schloss Dagstuhl was the perfect place for hosting a seminar like this. The unique scientific atmosphere and the historic building provided not only all the room we needed for our program and the working groups, but also plenty of opportunities for continued discussions and socializing outside the official program, especially in these difficult times during the COVID-19 pandemic with all participants being eager to meet and do research together in real life. On behalf of all participants, the organizers want to express their deep gratitude\nto the entire Dagstuhl staff for their outstanding support and service accompanying this seminar. We further thank Jules Wulms for helping us collect the contributions and prepare this report.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Akanksha Agrawal, Grzegorz Guspiel, Jayakrishnan Madathil, Saket Saurabh, and Meirav Zehavi.

            "title": "Algebraic Coding Theory for Networks, Storage, and Security",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAlgebraic Coding Theory for Networks, Storage, and Security was the fourth in a series of seminars exploring applications of coding theory in modern communications theory (see also Dagstuhl Seminars 16321 (2016), 13351 (2013) and 11461 (2011)). The seminar brought together 50 mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists with expertise in coding theory, network coding, storage coding, cryptography and code-based security to participate in dissemination and collaboration within the seminar themes. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe main focus of this workshop was to explore novel results in coding theory for application in data storage management, cryptography and privacy. The impact of novel coding techniques across these domains was discussed and explored. Particular emphasis was placed on new applications of coding theory in public key cryptography, coding techniques for privacy in distributed storage and on practical schemes using coding theory for content delivery. These novel coding applications continue to have a significant impact on changing focus and broadening of coding theory fundamentals.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverview talks were given by Philippe Gaborit (<em>Recent Results for Cryptography Based on Rank Metric</em>), Emina Soljanin, (<em>Service Rates of Codes</em>), Eitan Yaakobi, (<em>Private Proximity Retrieval</em>), Sacha Kurz, (<em>Multisets of Subspaces and Divisible Codes</em>), Heide Gluesing-Luerssen (<em>On Ferrers Diagram Codes</em>) and Salim El Rouayheb (<em>GASP Codes for Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication</em>). In addition, several short talks were given by other participants based on current research interests with a view to stimulating collaboration. Presentations on system cybersecurity, private information retrieval, locally recoverable codes, adversarial channels and various aspects of rank metric codes were given. The remaining seminar time was allocated to discussion groups, including those in code-based cryptography, private computation, service rates of codes, algebraic geometry codes and adversarial channels. Aside from the working group discussions, particpants took the opportunity to engage in specific collaborations with co-authors.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe summarize some of the content of the working group discussions below.\nIt has been well documented that redundancy is a basic requirement for stability of distributed data storage systems. Algebraic codes have been identified as having applications in providing efficiency in this domain far exceeding replication. Coding theory methods allow information retrieval minimizing disc access, storage size, local recoverability, data repair and data retrieval. Consequently, the area of storage coding has seen an exponential growth. An important aspect of user access in distributed storage is privacy of information retrieval so that users who are \nremotely accessing files can do so without storage servers knowing what they have accessed. Attempts to efficiently solve this problem\ncome from coding theory.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn important application of secret sharing schemes is distributed storage of private data, where each party is a storage node and all parties wish to store a secret securely and reliably. Secret sharing is a fundamental cryptographic primitive and is used as a building block in numerous secure protocols. In our discussions we focussed on secret sharing schemes for the threshold access structure and on secret sharing with errors/attacks in a broader context. Fuzzy vaults and secret sharing over networks were discussed. A motivation for this area is for example biometric authentication in the presence of adversaries.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother aspect of distributed storage is the service rate of codes. Emerging applications, such as distributed learning and fog computing, add yet another use for coding. In these applications, the goal is to maximize the number of users that can be simultaneously served by the system. One such service is simultaneous download of different jointly coded data blocks by many users competing for the system's resources. Here, coding affects the rates at which users can be served. The achievable service rate region is the set of request rates for each file that can be supported by the system. A variety of approaches to open problems about service rate were discussed. In particular, we addressed the question of code constructions that serve all requests for fixed rate constraints on file \nand the problem of how to determine the achievable service rate region for certain families of codes.\n</p> \n <p>\nPrivacy and security present formidable challenges in our modern connected world. Public-key cryptography is the foundation of multi-party communication as well as for key exchange of symmetric cryptosystems. With the increasing likelihood of a capable quantum computer, post-quantum secure systems have recently turned into the research focus, especially for devices that are hard to update and have very long life cycles. Code-based cryptography provides post-quantum secure public-key systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe working group on code-based-cryptography discussed the importance of security reduction arguments and went through several examples of these in relation to coding theory in cryptography. This discussion was a great benefit to the participants, many of whom have expertise in coding theory and keen to broaden their understanding of cryptography.\nThe group also focussed on McEliece-like systems based on quasi-cyclic moderate density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes and on low-rank parity-check (LRPC) codes. \nDistinguisher attacks were discussed, as well as possible modifications to the broken Gabidulin based cryptosystem.\n</p> \n <p>\nReliable communication across a channel in the presence of an adversary is a very general channel model that arises in many applications. Coding strategies for data transmission and authentication across the arbitrarily varying channel (where an adversary may alter the channel statistics) and for covert communication were discussed. A framework for linear systems under attack, such as the scenario where a restricted number of sensor measurements is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, was introduced and coding theoretic arguments used for attack detection and correction strategies.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere were about 20 PhD and postdoctoral researchers in attendance, who reported a very positive experience and satisfaction at being give the opportunity to explore new collaborations with more senior researchers and to get exposure to new problems in coding theory. All participants welcomed the time made available to them to take part in discussion groups and in more focussed collaborations. All were very pleased with the quality of the facilities and administrative support offered by staff at Schloss Dagstuhl, which made for a very productive meeting. Andreas Lenz and Rawad Bitar organised an afternoon excursion to Trier for the group. Giuseppe Cotardo collected and compiled data for the final published report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Bossert, Eimear Byrne, and Antonia Wachter-Zeh\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar on <em>Online Privacy and Web Transparency</em> was the first seminar at Dagstuhl that gathered together researchers working in web applications, online privacy, transparency on the web, privacy enhancing technologies, privacy measurement, and network economics, as well as several representatives of law and policy discipline.\n</p> \n <h3>Research context</h3> \n <p>\nThe web has become an essential part of our society and is currently the main medium of information delivery. Billions of users browse the web on a daily basis, and there are single websites that have reached over one billion user accounts. In this environment, the ability to track users and their online habits can be very lucrative for advertising companies, yet very intrusive for the privacy of users.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent research has shown that third-party advertising networks and data brokers use a wide range of techniques in order to track users across the web -- these techniques are used to reconstruct browsing sessions and to create profiles of users, inferring, among others, their hobbies, health status, political inclinations, and level of wealth. This information can be used to, not only deliver better targeted advertisements to users, but also to discriminate users, for example by providing customized prices for products based on a user\u2019s willingness and ability to pay. To protect users, several solutions have been proposed, ranging from the laws, policies and the W3C Do-Not-Track candidate recommendation, to browser tools developed by companies and volunteers, and other client-side mechanisms proposed by researchers. At the same time, a number of tools have been developed to increase transparency on the web and allow end users to know when they are being tracked and when discrimination happens.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar aimed to address the open questions of how to protect user privacy and how to increase transparency on the web. The key objectives of the seminar are (i) review the state of the art in the field; (ii) identify key technical challenges and brainstorm potential solutions; (iii) understand how computer science research results can influence law and policy; (iv) discuss ethical and legal issues in privacy research.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together scientists from the privacy and transparency communities, as well as policy makers interested in understanding how existing privacy laws and policies can be implemented, and representatives of Internet users organisations. The discussions at this Dagstuhl Seminar were strongly inspired by the following questions and challenges:\n</p> \n <h4>Technology</h4> \n <ul>\n<li> How can we detect tracking and algorithmic discrimination most effectively? What are the scientific and engineering challenges to overcome? What are the relative merits of automated, semi-automated, and crowdsourced approaches?\n</li><li> How can we ensure that methodologies, techniques, and tools are shared across different communities working on this topic?\n</li><li> How can we design the next generation of privacy tools, get users to actively use the tools, and generate data for privacy researchers to scrutinize?\n</li><li> What are the tracking techniques and data collection practices on mobile devices and how do they compare to those on the web?\n</li><li> What are the privacy and transparency issues raised by the Internet of Things, and how do we address them? \n</li></ul> \n <h4>Law</h4> \n <ul>\n<li> Do the current laws and policies cover existing tracking technologies? What is the process for reporting newly discovered tracking techniques to the appropriate Data Protection Authorities?\n</li><li> Even with the appropriate legislation in place, how can we ensure that companies comply with the law? What can researchers do to help enforce compliance? \n</li></ul> \n <h4>Ethical issues</h4> \n <ul>\n<li>What is the best way to conduct web privacy research taking ethical issues into account?\n</li><li> When does a study necessitate ethical review? \n</li></ul> \n <h4>Users</h4> \n <ul>\n<li> What is the most efficient way to raise user awareness about web tracking and transparency tools? \n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nataliia Bielova, Nikolaos Laoutaris, Arvind Narayanan, and Nick Nikiforakis\n                </div> \n",

Over time, chip feature sizes shrink; the length of\ncryptographic keys and the complexity of cryptographic algorithms grows; and\nthe number of components integrated in a chip increases. While scaling is\ngenerally thought of as beneficial to the resulting implementations, this\ndoes not hold for secure electronic design. Larger and faster chips, for\nexample, are not necessarily more secure. Indeed, the relations between\nscaling and the resulting security are poorly understood. This Dagstuhl\nSeminar hosted researchers in secure electronic system design, spanning all\nabstraction levels from cryptographic engineering over chip design to system\nintegration.\n</p> \n <h3>Discussion Topics</h3> \n <p>The mechanisms of secure scaling require investigation of the links between\nCryptography, Technology, and Digital Integration. Cryptographers are\nconcerned with novel and secure algorithms that remain secure even as\ncryptanalytic capabilities improve. Technologists are concerned with the next\ngeneration of transistors and their implementation into a reliable and stable\nprocess technology. Integrators are concerned with electronic design\nautomation tools that can manage the rapidly increasing complexity of\nelectronic design, and the are concerned with the integration of components\non a complex system-on-chip.\n</p> \n <p>\nThrough its participants, the seminar offered a unique opportunity to discuss\ncross-cutting topics in Secure Scaling. The following list are examples of\nsuch cross-cutting topics.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Scaling effects in Privacy and Security. The massive amount of\n     connected devices will create significant challenges towards security and\n     privacy. Major questions involve data ownership and key\n     ownership and management.\n</li><li> Power/Energy Efficient Crypto: Secure wireless devices and Secure RFID\n    are two well known examples of applications that require security under\n    severe power and/or energy constraints. Optimizing a cryptographic\n    algorithm for power/energy efficiency needs to consider all abstraction\n    levels of design.\n</li><li> High-Performance Crypto: Information Technology is increasingly\n    asymmetric, with larger, high-performance servers at one end, and a large\n    population of tiny devices at the other side. Cryptographic designs must\n    scale towards high-performance, high-throughput implementations while it\n    must also accommodate small-footprint, low-latency designs.\n</li><li> Secure Test: Complex chips utilize a number of testing strategies such\n    as BIST and JTAG. When a chip includes a secure part, the test\n    infrastructure carries a potential risk of abuse. Secure Test is a test\n    strategy for complex chips that takes this risk fully into account.\n</li><li> Complexity Management in Secure SoC: Managing and integrating a secure module into system-on-chip context is challenging and creates a hard\n    verification problem that cuts through multiple traditional layers of design.\n    Furthermore, managing multiple stakeholders in a single chip design\n    is extremely challenging and may result in conflicting design requirements.\n</li><li> Implementation Attacks: In modern cryptographic designs, side-channel\n    analysis, fault-analysis and physical tampering are an integral part of\n    the threat model. This requires design techniques that fully integrate\n    countermeasures as part of the design process. In addition, the design of\n    a countermeasure effective against most forms of tampering is an open\n    research issue.\n</li><li> Technology effects on implementation attacks. Better insight the internal\n    operation of secure implementations at all abstraction levels leads to\n    novel implementation attacks, that work at finer granularity, and that use\n    novel source of leakage such as optical leakage.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar supported participants in learning about the state-of-the-art\ndevelopments in the three different domains covered in the workshop\n(Cryptography, Integration, and Technology). The seminar also supported the\npresentation of specific cross-cutting topics, as well as round-table\n(panel-style) discussions.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Lejla Batina and Swarup Bhunia and Patrick Schaumont\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Machine Learning Meets Visualization to Make Artificial Intelligence Interpretable",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe recent advances in machine learning (ML) have led to unprecedented successes in areas such as computer vision and natural language processing. In the future, these technologies promise to revolutionize everything ranging from science and engineering to social studies and policy making. However, one of the fundamental challenges in making these technologies useful, usable, reliable and trustworthy is that they are all driven by extremely complex models for which it is impossible to derive simple (closed-format) descriptions and explanations. Mapping decisions from a learned model to human perceptions and understanding of that world is very challenging. Consequently, a detailed understanding of the behavior of these AI systems remains elusive, thus making it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to distinguish between actual knowledge and artifacts in the data presented to a model. This fundamental limitation should be addressed in order to support model optimization, understand risks, disseminate decisions and findings, and most importantly to promote trust.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile this grand challenge can be partially addressed by designing novel theoretical techniques to validate and reason about models/data, in practice, they are found to be grossly insufficient due to our inability to translate the requirements from real-world applications into tractable mathematical formulations. For example, concerns about AI systems (e.g., biases) are intimately connected to several human factors such as how information is perceived, cognitive biases, etc. This crucial gap has given rise to the field of <em>interpretable machine learning</em>, which at its core is concerned with providing a human user better understanding of the model's logic and behavior. In recent years, the machine learning community, as well as virtually all application areas, have seen a rapid expansion of research efforts in interpretability and related topics. In the process, visualization, or more generally interactive systems, have become a key component of these efforts since they provide one avenue to exploit expert intuition and hypothesis-driven exploration. However, due to the unprecedented speed with which the field is currently progressing, it is difficult for the various communities to maintain a cohesive picture of the state of the art and the open challenges; especially given the extreme diversity of the research areas involved. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe focus of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to convene various stakeholders to jointly discuss needs, characterize open research challenges, and propose a joint research agenda. In particular, three different stakeholders were engaged in this seminar: application experts with unmet needs and practical problems; machine learning researchers who are the main source of theoretical advances; and visualization and HCI experts that can devise intuitive representations and exploration frameworks for practical solutions. Through this seminar, the group of researchers discussed the state of practice, identified crucial gaps and research challenges, and formulated a joint research agenda to guide research in interpretable ML.\n</p> \n <h3>Program Overview</h3> \n <p>\nThe main goal of this Dagstuhl seminar was to discuss the current state and future research directions of interpretable Machine Learning. Because two different scientific communities met, the Machine Learning community and the Visualization community, we started the seminar by discussing and defining important terms and concepts of the field. Afterwards, we split up into working groups to collect answers to the following questions: <em>\"Who needs interpretable machine learning? For what task is it needed? Why is it needed?\"</em>. This step was then followed by a series of application lightning talks (please refer to the abstracts below for details). \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the second day, we had two overview talks, one covering the machine learning perspective on interpretability, and the other one the visualization perspective on the topic. Afterwards, we built working groups to collect research challenges from the presented applications and beyond.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe third day was dedicated to clustering the research challenges into priority research directions. The following priority research directions were identified:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Interpreting Learned Features and Learning Interpretable Features\n</li><li> Evaluation of Interpretability Methods\n</li><li> Evaluation and Model Comparison with Interpretable Machine Learning\n</li><li> Uncertainty\n</li><li> Visual Encoding and Interactivity\n</li><li> Interpretability Methods\n</li><li> Human-Centered Design\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nOn Thursday, the priority research directions were further detailed in working groups. We had two rounds of working groups in which 3, respectively 4, priority research challenges were discussed in parallel by the groups according to the following aspects: problem statement, sub-challenges, example applications, and related priority research directions. Furthermore, all research challenges were mapped into descriptive axes of the problem space and the solution space.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the last day, we designed an overview diagram that helps to communicate the result to the larger scientific community.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Enrico Bertini, Peer-Timo Bremer, Daniela Oelke, and Jayaraman Thiagarajan\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nNetworked computing systems have reached a watershed, as the amount of networked-data generated by user applications exceeds the processing capability of any single computer. This requires an integrated system design, unlike the traditional layered approaches. This seminar therefore brought together experts from the operating systems, distributed systems, computer architecture, networks, storage and databases communities, to advance the state of the art in discipline convergence in networked systems. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe networking community has advanced in giant leaps, making high bandwidth networking and software-defined networking (SDN) commodity. Furthermore, the advent of network function virtualization (NFV) has started the convergence of computing technologies and networking technologies. The computing community, on the other hand, struggled to overcome power density limitations, resource- efficiency and quality-of-service etc. for cloud computing as well as end host computing (or edge computing), and cannot keep up. \n</p> \n <p>\nRevolutionary networked system design approaches are now emerging, seeking to increase performance, efficiency and security through the convergence of disciplines: compute, storage and networking. This seminar investigated both hardware and software challenges, and attempted to bridge the gaps between different communities in order to compensate the challenges in some areas with emerging breakthroughs from other areas. Over the course of the 5-day seminar, seventeen presentations were given on various aspects of data center networking. Taking the presentations as input, the workshop then broke into five working groups to discuss research aspects of operating systems, distributed systems, computer architecture, networks, storage, and databases. The talks as well as the outcome of the breakout session and the concluding statements are summarized in this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Yungang Bao, Lars Eggert, Simon Peter, and Noa Zilberman\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Radical Innovation and Design for Connected and Automated Vehicles",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAutomated driving will most likely be the next big change in individual mobility. Currently, research is still primarily concerned with technical challenges of Automated Driving Systems (ADS), such as sensing, data processing, communication, or steering. HCI researchers have already started to develop concepts for working, relaxing, or recreational activities (in privately owned) ADS as rather incremental innovations. There is, however, room to think about creative ways to use automated vehicles (AV) and connected technology towards the public interest beyond incremental changes. Current open questions are, amongst others:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> What are possible innovative and groundbreaking visions for future human transport concepts?</li>\n<li> How can we apply radical innovation and design and leverage AV technology to other</li>\napplications and use cases?\n<li> What types of research and design methods are able to contribute to radical designs, instead of\nincremental?</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar aimed to contribute to continued research that is able to challenge the current generative/evaluative research approach for automated driving systems against a radical innovations attempt. Similar to the invention of the car, which was not just an incremental improvement of a horse carriage, we want to question whether the current incremental research approach is appropriate and want to provoke novel opportunities.\nWe further wanted to challenge whether a human-centered design approach is appropriate in the domain of connected, automated vehicles or if related innovation-centered approaches like design thinking are more constructive. \n</p> \n <p>\nAn integral part of the seminar was to reach the next level of product quality, to learn from each other, and to disseminate individual's experience for boosting subsequent research. In order to give the seminar participants something they can use directly from the seminar, we dedicated two blocks of time for teaching methodological knowledge in addition to the creative sessions, interactive panels and practical work. The goal was to give the participants the opportunity to try out new methods, such as brainwriting, bodystorming, focus groups, user enactment, WorldCafe, amongst others, that they would like to use in their own research in the future - thus a directly applicable result of the seminar. Details on the schedule of the seminar are shown below.\n</p> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0005/5332/22222schedule.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Schedule of Dagstuhl seminar 22222 (May 29 to June 3, 2022).\" src=\"/storage/media/0005/5332/22222schedule.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a> \n <div class=\"caption mt-2 mb-4\"><b>Figure 1</b> Schedule of Dagstuhl seminar 22222 (May 29 to June 3, 2022).</div> \n <p>\nTo promote trans- and interdisciplinarity, we invited computer scientists/engineers, interaction designers, UI/UX designers, market and consumer psychologists as well as urban planners from industry and academia to discuss and design future mobility and vehicle concepts.\nWe expected three types of results from this seminar - and will discuss at the end of this report which contributions were created in the seminar and to which degree these results were achieved by the end of the seminar.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>New visions for transportation and interaction</b>. The seminar will focus on radical and\ninnovative visions for the future of human transport and will employ innovation-centered\napproaches to foster out-of-the-box thinking.</li>\n<li><b>Novel applications for AV technology</b>. Perhaps the most significant contribution of the\nseminar should be novel applications for automated vehicle technology that will stretch the\nresearch and science community into new directions. We expect that in the coming 3 to 10\nyears, these new ideas should serve as inspiration for the research of the seminar attendees and,\nmore broadly, the communities involved in designing automotive and mobility user interfaces.</li>\n<li><b>Roadmap(s) for research</b>. Another goal is the elaboration of a roadmap to outline proposed research collaborations and recommend new funding mechanisms. Furthermore, the roadmap should lay out plans for disseminating results such that members of our community are well informed, and such that they can effectively interact with researchers and practitioners in related communities, such as human-computer interaction, human-factors, user experience, automotive engineering, psychology, and urban/traffic planning.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nPerhaps the most tangible and easy-to-communicate outcome of the seminar for other interested parties are short videos/video prototypes of ideas created over the week in group work. All of the videos were professionalized in the aftermath of the seminar and submitted, along with one short paper each, to the ACM AutomotiveUI conference, where three of the videos were accepted in the video track and shown to the audience at the conference in Seoul (videos are available as supplementary material in the ACM DL).\n</p> \n <h4>References</h4> \n <ol>\n<li>Nikolas Martelaro, Debargha Dey, Gary Burnett, Helena K.

            "title": "Analysis, Interpretation and Benefit of User-Generated Data: Computer Science Meets Communication Studies",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe success of the Internet as a communication technology and tool for human interaction in countless contexts, including production and trade, has had a dramatic impact on modern societies. With diffusion rates nearing one hundred percent in most societal groups, there is virtually no one whose life is not influenced by online communication -- either directly or indirectly. Every day, private end users and business users act and interact online, producing immense amounts of data. Many disciplines, including computer science, computer linguistics, psychology, and communication studies, have identified \u2018big data\u2019 generated by online users as a research field. As a result, big data has become a somewhat over-hyped catch-all term for many different types of data, which are analyzed through varying methods for multiple purposes. This ranges from an analysis of (unstructured) Twitter or Facebook content to rule-structured texts as found in the professional media (i.e., news websites). The implication of value generated through sheer size of data sets is misleading, though -- much of the value is based on the nature of these data sets as being user-generated, either on purpose or inevitably (and often unknowingly) as behavioral traces of actions with divergent aims.\n</p> \n <p>\nBig data sets generated by human users pose some challenges to the scientific disciplines that are interested in them: Typically, computer scientists have the knowledge and tools to access, extract and process big data sets. However, the analysis and interpretation of such data mirrors the interactions of users who produced the data and is not following a purely technological logic. In other words, such data has a human/social component, and in order to interpret and understand it, social-scientific theories and methods are helpful. Social scientists, however, typically do not specialize in the practicalities of online technologies and of programming. While they have theoretical approaches and empirical methods available that can be helpful in the analysis of user generated content -- and this is especially true for communication scholars who specialize in the analysis of (online) media content --, their possibilities to access and process data are limited (as this is not core to their field yet). \n</p> \n <p>\nConsequently, both disciplinary approaches will not be able to fully address the challenges of analyzing big data based on user (inter)action from the perspective of their own \u2018silo\u2019. A combination of the two approaches seems fruitful, as each discipline may help in solving the problems of the other, and the sum will be more than its parts -- leading to a better understanding of social interaction and human communication in a digitized world. This seminar will bring together both computer scientists interested in the analysis of (large-scale) user-generated data, and communication scholars interested in computer-assisted acquisition and processing of such data. It is intended to start a fruitful dialogue on potential approaches, methods, uses and benefits of a cooperation between the two disciplines, and it will also include the input of practitioners in the field of media and business who will offer valuable insights into practical use cases.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Thorsten Quandt, German Shegalov, Helle Sj\u00f8vaag, and Gottfried Vossen\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nMetabolomics is the study of metabolites (the small molecules involved in \nmetabolism) in living cells, cell populations, organisms or communities. \nMetabolites are key players in almost all biological processes, play various \nfunctional roles providing energy, building blocks, signaling, \ncommunication, and defense and serve as clinical biomarkers for detecting \nmedical conditions such as cancer. Small molecule drugs (many of which are \nderived from metabolites) account for 90% of prescribed therapeutics. \nComplete understanding of biological systems requires detecting and \ninterpreting the metabolome in time and space.\n</p> \n <p>\nMass spectrometry is the predominant analytical technique for detecting and \nidentifying metabolites and other small molecules in high--throughput \nexperiments. Huge technological advances in mass spectrometry and \nexperimental workflows during the last decade enabled novel investigations \nof biological systems on the metabolite level. Research into computational \nworkflows, the simulation of tandem mass spectra, compound identification \nand molecular networking have helped disentangle the vast amount of \ninformation that mass spectrometry provides. Spatial metabolomics on \ndifferent spatial scales from single cells to organs and organisms has posed \ndata analysis challenges, in particular due to an unprecedented data volume \ngenerated that grows quadratically with the increase of spatial resolution.\n</p> \n <p>\nContinued improvements to instruments, resolution, ionization and \nacquisition techniques mean that metabolomics mass spectrometry experiments \ncan generate massive amounts of data, and the field is evolving into a \"big \ndata\" science. This is particularly the case for imaging mass spectrometry, \nwhere a single dataset can easily be many gigabytes or even terabytes in \nsize. Despite this dramatic increase in data, much of the data analysis in \nmetabolomics is still performed manually and requires expert knowledge as \nwell as the collation of data from a plethora of sources. Novel \ncomputational methods are required to exploit spectral and, in the case of \nimaging, also spatial information from the data, while remaining efficient \nenough to process tens to hundreds of gigabytes of data.\n</p> \n <p>\nDagstuhl Seminar 17491 on Computational Metabolomics: \nIdentification, Interpretation, Imaging built on the success of the first \nComputational Metabolomics Dagstuhl Seminar (15492) in 2015. A number of \ntopics overlapped with the 2015 seminar, while the focus on imaging \nintroduced new perspectives, participants and topics. In contrast to the \nfirst seminar, 17491 was a large seminar, with 45 very active participants \nand a large portion of young scientists. \nFrom the first hours of the seminar, effort was made to integrate these \nyoung scientists in the discussions and presentations and this paid off \nleading to lively discussions involving all participants.\nMany participants were new to Dagstuhl and the concept of Dagstuhl seminars, \nwhich led to a seminar that was a combination of being semi-structured and \nspontaneous. Very positive feedback was received from all during a \ncomprehensive feedback session before lunch on Friday, including \nconstructive ideas for a new focus for a possible new seminar in 2019. \n </p> \n <p>\nOn the scientific side, the seminar covered numerous topics which were found \nto be most relevant for the computational analysis of mass spectrometry \ndata, and ranged from the \"dark matter in metabolomics\" to \n\"integrating spatial and conventional metabolomics\"; see the full report \nfor a comprehensive description.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar has fully achieved its key goals: to foster the exchange of \nideas between the experimental and computational communities; to expose the \nnovel computational developments and challenges; and, to establish \ncollaborations to address grand and priority challenges by bridging the best \navailable data with the best methods.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Theodore Alexandrov, Sebastian B\u00f6cker, Pieter Dorrestein, and Emma Schymanski\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\n<em>Computational complexity theory</em> is the study of computation under bounded resources, and the tradeoffs thereof offered by specific problems and classes of problems in various computational models.  Such resources include time and space for classical computation, randomnesss, non-determinism, and oracles for more advanced uniform machines, size/advice for circuits/non-uniform computation, interaction for communication protocols, length and depth for proof complexity, and much more.  The goals of work in this field are not only to discover and improve these tradeoffs, but ideally to find tight lower bounds to match the solutions that have been found, and use such results in one of the models to inform results in the others.  Despite decades of work on these problems, the answers to many foundational questions (such as <b>P</b> vs <b>NP</b>, <b>P</b> vs <b>BPP</b>, <b>NP</b> vs <b>co-NP</b>) still remain out of reach.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor the 2019 instalment of the seminar series <em>Computational Complexity of Discrete Problems</em> - which evolved out of the seminar series <em>Complexity of Boolean Functions</em> that dates back to the founding of Dagstuhl - Anna G\u00e1l, Oded Regev, Rahul Santhanam, and Till Tantau invited 40 participants to Dagstuhl to work towards discovering new results in the field. The seminar started with the assembly of a large \"graph of interests\" that allowed the participants both to present their own research interests and to see how these align with the other present researchers. The bulk of the research work was then done in the form of, on the one hand, talks in the morning and late afternoon and, on the other hand, break-out sessions and small discussions in the afternoon by smaller groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nA distinguishing feature of the seminar talks were the lively discussions during and after the talk: given the often highly abstract and specialized topics presented by the experts in the field, lively discussions are by no means a given and they proved to be both rewarding and helpful for all participants. In the informal afternoon sessions, smaller groups of researchers had ample time to tackle the open problems of the field; with some discussions still going on after midnight. Two events - the traditional Wednesday hike and the traditional wine-and-cheese party on Thursday - allowed everyone well-earned breaks from doing research on computational complexity. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe range of topics covered by the participants during the seminar was broad and included derandomization, lower bounds for specific problems, communication complexity, complexity classes, graph algorithms, learning theory, coding theory, and proof complexity. Specific selected results presented throughout include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> A proof that the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture is false, yielding the first exponential gap between the logarithm of the approximate rank and randomized communication complexity for total functions.\n</li><li> An oracle separation of <b>BQP</b> and the polynomial hierarchy, showing a strong converse to the Bennett et al. oracle relative to which <b>BQP</b> cannot solve <b>NP</b>-complete problems in sub-exponential time.\n</li><li> Improved lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, including    \n<ul>\n<li>MCSP not in <b>AC</b>^{0}<b>[p]</b>,\n</li><li>MCSP requires N^{3-o(1)}-size de Morgan formulas,\n</li><li>MCSP requires N^{2-o(1)}-size general formulas,\n</li><li>MCSP requires smash{2^{Omega(N^{1/d+2.01})}}-size depth-d <b>AC</b>^{0} circuits,\n</li></ul>\nwhere the first result is achieved by showing MCSP can solve the coin problem and the others using properties of local pseudorandom generators.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nOpen problems were posed by Amit Chakrabarty, Alexander Golovnev, Or Meir, and Omri Weinstein.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers, Anna G\u00e1l, Oded Regev, Rahul Santhanam, and Till Tantau, would like to thank all participants at this point for the many contributions they made, but we would also like to especially thank the Dagstuhl staff for doing -- as always -- an excellent job and helping with organizational matters and with making everyone feel welcome.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anna G\u00e1l, Rahul Santhanam, and Till Tantau\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Human-Game AI Interaction",
            "data": "\n <p>\n Over the past decades, artificial intelligence has evolved from esoteric techniques used mainly in computer science research to an integral and ever-growing part of the daily lives of most humans. People regularly interact with semi-intelligent machines during their daily lives, whether it is via smartphone applications, embedded systems in cars and household electronics, client support systems, or helpful technology installed on personal computers. People wish and expect systems to respond intelligently to their requests, and even to anticipate their actions. While improvements to the interaction between humans and intelligent systems in this respect have been made over the years, there is still a long way to go before these systems exhibit a level of understanding and intuition which can be expected from a human partner.\n</p> \n <p>\nHuman-computer interfaces (HCI) are a well-established scientific research domain. We noted that HCI research generally neglects the use of artificial intelligence as a integral part of an interface. Almost any person that uses computers can quickly recall multiple frustrating interactions with the current state of the art in artificial intelligence in interfaces. Since annoyance and apparent incompetence can derail the adoption of otherwise promising and potentially transformative technology, research into improving interfaces using AI is timely. \n</p> \n <p>\nAn AI assistant is broadly recognized as being a key factor in increasing human productivity, but it must be an AI assistant that the user either enjoys working with or that the user barely notices, not one that must be bludgeoned into useful behavior or constantly fought with.  Perfection of assistants, companions, and even opponents that correctly anticipate and collaborate in the relatively controlled domain of games provides a smooth path to such developments in broader contexts.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe argue that virtual worlds, as found in computer games, are an ideal environment in which to experiment with the interaction between humans and artificial intelligence. There are at least three reasons for this. First, virtual worlds often approach the complexity of the \"real world\", while still being under the control of the researcher and completely observable.  Second, the agents in virtual worlds are supposed to represent \"real people\" and are approached as such by the humans who \"play\" with the virtual world.  Third, the potential interactions that players have with the virtual worlds are highly diverse and wide-ranging, which presents a substantial challenge for artificial intelligence to respond to in a reasonable fashion.\n</p> \n <p>    \nIn recent years, the number of ways in which human players can interact with games have increased considerably.  While ten years ago interaction was almost exclusively through mouse and keyboard or controllers, nowadays games can potentially respond to natural movements and facial expressions captured by a camera, to spoken language, to eye movements, and to signals captured by a variety of sensors.  Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has become more mainstream, offering possibilities for games to respond to a users' brain activity. Using VR technology, games can respond to movements of players in natural space.  AI that can use all these interface elements to make game agents a natural and appreciated partner or opponent for humans can form the basis for advanced AI agents that interact with humans not only in games, but also in the real world.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe research area in which the proposed seminar is rooted is the interaction between humans and game AI, aiming for natural and appropriate responses of computational agents in virtual worlds to human behavior, making use of both traditional interaction technology as well as modern sensor and interaction technology. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe research area lends itself for a wide range of research topics. For the preparation of this seminar, we proposed the following set of sub-topics:</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Personalized Human-Game AI Interaction:</b> Humans have different backgrounds, interests, and goals. As such, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" interference and interaction form. Under this topic, we explore game adaptation as a type of automatic game design.  The goal is to permit the AI to adapt the game environment to the player based on the observed features and received feedback. Instead of fully automatic game design, a sophisticated game design leaves scope for an AI to adapt to a broad variety of players. \n  Such personalized adaptation could be extended to adaptation of the actual game interface -- in games, usually complex interactions are possible, which novice players are not capable of employing. Therefore, automatically adapting the interface to the observed experience level of the player may be a valid approach to effective personalization.</li>\n<li><b>Human-Game AI Interaction for People with Disabilities:</b> People with disabilities require special attention when designing interfaces, to mitigate adverse effects of disabilities, so that a suitable experience is ensured for everyone. \n  Game AI can potentially help to diagnose disabilities, both physically and psychologically.  There is also the potential for game AI to create awareness of issues faced by those with disabilities, by intelligently adapting the interface in such a way that the player experiences it as a person with disabilities would. </li>\n<li><b>Multimodal Interfacing and Interaction:</b>\n  Multimodal systems offer a flexible and efficient interaction environment that consists of several input/output possibilities including text, speech, and vision. How to effectively use these possibilities in game design is still an open problem.  A compelling application of artificial intelligence is to rapidly learn which modes a given player finds natural and enjoyable.  The type of interface a user is comfortable with is likely to cross boundaries between different applications, meaning that an \"interface fingerprint\" may be derivable that can be carried with the user, permitting the re-use of information gained.</li>\n<li><b>Enhancing Human Creativity with Artificial Intelligence:</b> Computational Creativity is a field of AI where automatic AI systems design and create various forms of art, which may include images, drawings, poetry and music. In the broader sense, these systems create new content either completely by themselves, or with the human providing input at specific points. Research into this fusion of the creative skills of humans and AI systems would move the state of the art a step forward: from being inferior content creators the AI systems would become a tool for amplifying and augmenting the superior creative abilities of a human being, in a bi-directional collaboration process. AI systems should be able to learn from the human, anticipate what they intend to do, and understand the domain of discourse. They would provide advice on content creation and help when the user struggles with certain techniques or creative methods. By learning the skills of the human, AI systems would be able to propose alternatives that lie outside their expertise, allowing the humans to learn, refine and improve their capabilities. The users would experience a system that adapts to their skills, needs and pace, and becomes a personalized companion in their learning process.</li>\n<li><b>Trustful and Reliable Human-Game AI Interaction:</b> We often observe that humans feel uncomfortable with AI recommendations. Moreover, mistakes made by humans are deemed more tolerable than those made by an AI. While there is no objective rationale for this difference, it is hard to justify the use of AI for humans by arguing that AI offers a lower mistake probability compared to humans. It is therefore imperative to find new ways to convince humans to interact with the game AI and to take its advice seriously. Moreover, it is crucial to minimize any effect that might harm such trust, regardless of its origin. </li>\n<li><b>Information Flow in Human-Game AI Interaction:</b>\n  A game AI must observe the human player and, in turn, provide players with information that they find helpful, valuable, or interesting.  Even the most potentially helpful information is not actually helpful if the player cannot understand it or if it is not useful to their particular style of play.  The flow of information is particularly important between the human player and an AI companion.  Reliable metrics that ascertain if the human uses information offered by the AI, that check if the AI fails to provide information that the human tries to find in other ways, and assessment of defects in the human's play that suggest which information is needed, are potential goals of research in this area.  </li>\n<li><b>Believable Human-Game AI Interaction:</b>\n    In the last decade, contests have been held at several conferences where human judges voted on the \"humanity\" of both human game players and AI players in an effort to score the ability of the AI players to behave in a plausibly human manner. Attempts to make AIs interact in a way that is indistinguishable from human interaction are a natural way to structure research into human-game AI interaction.\n  We note that the believability of game AI often suffers because it fails to recognize that it misunderstands the human player, or that the human player misunderstands the AI. How to recognize misunderstanding, followed by how to correct for misunderstanding, are important steps in making game AI more believable.</li>\n<li><b>Ethics of Human-Game AI Interaction:</b> Several of the aforementioned research directions rely heavily on big data analysis. \n    Acquiring such a massive amount of data is a challenging task. Perfect anonymization is hard to achieve, and often undesirable as multiple parties are involved in data collection and integration. To what extent is it ethical to collect personal interaction information? Are there ethical restrictions to the extent to which an AI is allowed to analyze a player's personality and demographics? These questions need answering even if a player gives permission to collect and use such data. </li>\n<li><b>Novel Forms of Interaction and Interfaces in Game AI:</b> New technology gives rise to new possibilities in game interaction and interfacing. While developers often try to restrict themselves to small adaptations in tried-and-true forms of interaction, it makes sense to consider the interaction possibilities originating with novel technology, such as virtual reality and brain-computer interfacing. Beyond those, there may be ways for humans and AI to interact with each other that has not yet been imagined, or which can benefit from re-imagining. Player-AI interaction can be implemented in many forms, such as (1) cuing a player with environmental information from music to decor, (2) influencing a player by adjusting game elements such as local architecture, opponents, and rewards, and (3) making a player respond to the social tone of non-player characters. Such alternate forms of player-AI interaction warrant investigation. </li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThis seminar was organized around workgroups, which worked in teams and topics proposed by the participants of the seminar in the areas outlined above. These workgroups were accompanied by plenary sessions for group formation, topic debate and discussions of the deliberation of each group. Workgroups were dynamic, so participants could  move between them, and new groups were formed during the week. A Discord server was setup for coordination and announcements, and it was also used by the different groups for document and link sharing. This also has the benefit of providing a place for discussions after the seminar, easing the communication and further work among the members of each workgroup.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt is worthwhile mentioning the work carried out during the invitation process. Due to the COVID crisis, the changes in the political landscape, and the war in Ukraine, many declined the invitation, and many participants dropped out after originally having accepted the invitation. Thus, multiple rounds of invitations were run until two weeks before the seminar. We invited close to 100 people, the full list of invitations having a high diversity (a 50\\% male-female split, about half invitations for 'junior' people, and invitees hailing from all continents - including South America and Africa, which are usually highly underrepresented). In the end, just over 30 participants attended the seminar (out of the 45 possible). Size-wise this was a slight disappointment. We were fortunate, however, that those that did attend were highly enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable about the topics covered, which made the seminar a great success.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Pieter Spronck, Daniel Ashlock, Setareh Maghsudi, and Diego Perez Liebana\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Data Series Management",
            "data": "\n <p>\nWe now witness a very strong interest by users across different domains on data series (a.k.a. time series) management systems. It is not unusual for industrial applications that produce data series to involve numbers of sequences (or subsequences) in the order of billions. As a result, analysts are unable to handle the vast amounts of data series that they have to filter and process. \nConsider for instance that in the health industry, for several of their analysis tasks, neuroscientists are reducing each of their 3,000 point long sequences to just the global average, because they cannot handle the size of the full sequences. Moreover, in the quest towards personalized medicine, scientists are expected to collect around 2-40 ExaBytes of DNA sequence data by 2025. In engineering, there is an abundance of sequential data. Consider for example that each engine of a Boeing Jet generates 10 TeraBytes of data every 30 minutes, while domains such as energy (i.e., wind turbine monitoring, etc.), data center, and network monitoring continuously produce measurements, forcing organizations to develop their custom solutions (i.e., Facebook Gorilla).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of this seminar was to enable researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas in the topic of data series management, towards the definition of the principles necessary for the design of a big sequence management system, and the corresponding open research directions. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar focused on the following key topics related to data series management:\n</p> \n <p>\nApplications in multiple domains: We examined applications and requirements originating from various fields, including astrophysics, neuroscience, engineering, and operations management. The goal was to allow scientists and practitioners to exchange ideas, foster collaborations, and develop a common terminology.\n</p> \n <p>\nData series storage and access patterns: We described some of the existing (academic and commercial) systems for managing data series, examined their differences, and commented on their evolution over time. We identified their shortcomings, debated on the best ways to lay out data series on disk and in memory in order to optimize data series queries, and examined how to integrate domain specific summarizations/indexes and compression schemes in existing systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nQuery optimization: One of the most important open problems in data series management is that of query optimization. However, there has been no work on estimating the hardness/selectivity of data series similarity search queries. This is of paramount importance for effective access path selection. During the seminar we discussed the current work in the topic, and identified promising future research directions.\n</p> \n <p>\nMachine learning and data mining for data series: Recent developments in deep neural network architectures have also caused an intense interest in examining the interactions between machine learning algorithms and data series management. We discussed machine learning from two perspectives. First, how machine learning techniques can be applied for data series analysis tasks, as well as for tuning data series management systems. Second, we how data series management systems can contribute towards the scalability of machine learning pipelines.\n</p> \n <p>\nVisualization for data series exploration: There are several research problems in the intersection of visualization and data series management. Existing data series visualization and human interaction techniques only consider very small datasets, yet, they can play a significant role in the tasks of similarity search, analysis, and exploration of very large data series collections. We discussed open research problems along these directions, related to both the frontend and the backend.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anthony Bagnall, Richard L.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis workshop brought together the whole proof complexity community spanning from Frege proof systems and circuit-inspired lower bounds via geometric and algebraic proof systems all the way to bounded arithmetic. In this executive summary, we first give an overview of proof complexity, and then describe the goals of the seminar week. Finally, we discuss the relation to previous workshops and conferences.\n</p> \n <h3>Topic of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nEver since the groundbreaking NP-completeness paper of Cook [18], the problem of deciding whether a given propositional logic formula is satisfiable or not has been on centre stage in theoretical computer science. During the last two decades, Satisfiability has also developed from a problem of mainly theoretical interest into a practical approach for solving applied problems. Although all known Boolean satisfiability solvers (SAT solvers) have exponential running time in the worst case, enormous progress in performance has led to satisfiability algorithms becoming a standard tool for solving large-scale problems in, for\nexample, hardware and software verification, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, operations research, and sometimes even pure mathematics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe study of proof complexity originated with the seminal paper of \nCook and Reckhow [19]. In its most general form, a proof system for a formal language L is a predicate P(x, pi), computable in time polynomial in \nthe sizes |x| and |pi| of the input, and having the property that   \nfor all x in L there exists a string pi (a proof) for which\nP(x, pi) evaluates to true, whereas for any x \notin L it should hold for all strings pi that P(x, pi) evaluates to false. A proof system is said to be polynomially bounded if for every x in L there exists a proof  pi_{x} for x\nthat has size at most polynomial in |x|.  A <em>propositional proof system</em> is a proof system for the language of tautologies in propositional logic, i.e. for formulas that always evaluate to true no matter how the values true and false are assigned to variables in the formula.\n</p> <p>\nFrom a theoretical point of view, one important motivation for proof complexity is the intimate connection with the fundamental problem of P versus NP. Since NP is exactly the set of languages with polynomially bounded proof systems, and since Tautology can be seen to be the dual problem of Satisfiability, we have the famous theorem of [19] that NP = coNP if and only if there exists a polynomially bounded propositional proof system. Thus, if it could be shown that there are no polynomially bounded proof systems for tautologies, P \u2260 NP would follow as a corollary since P is closed under complement. One\nway of approaching this problem is to study stronger and stronger proof systems and try to prove superpolynomial lower bounds on proof size. However, although great progress has been made in the last couple of decades for a variety of proof systems, this goal still appears very distant. A second theoretical motivation is that simple propositional proof systems provide analogues of subsystems of Peano Arithmetic where the power of mathematical reasoning\nis restricted. Of particular interest here are various bounded arithmetic systems, which in some sense are intended to capture feasible/polynomial-time reasoning. Proving strong lower bounds on propositional logic encodings of some combinatorial principle, say, in a propositional proof system can in this way show that establishing the validity of this principle requires more powerful mathematics than what is provided by the corresponding subsystem of Peano Arithmetic. One can thus quantify how \"deep\" different mathematical truths are,\nas well as shed light on the limits of our (human, rather than automated) proof techniques. At the same time, since it is an empirically verified fact that low-complexity proofs generalize better and are often more constructive, classifying which truths have feasible proofs is also a way to approach the classification of algorithmic problems by their computational complexity.\nThe precise sense in which this can be formalized into a tool for the complexity theorist is one of the goals of bounded arithmetic.\n</p> <p>\nA third prominent motivation for the study of proof complexity is also algorithmic but of a more practical nature. As was mentioned above, designing efficient algorithms for proving tautologies\u2014or, equivalently, testing satisfiability\u2014is a very important problem not only in the theory of computation but also in applied research and industry. All SAT solvers, regardless of whether they produce a written proof or not, explicitly or implicitly define a system in which proofs are searched for and rules which determine what proofs in this system look like. Proof complexity analyses what it takes to simply write down and verify the proofs that such a solver might find, ignoring the computational effort needed to actually find them. Thus, a lower bound for a proof system tells us that any algorithm, even an optimal\n(non-deterministic) one magically making all the right choices, must necessarily use at least the amount of a certain resource specified by this bound. In the other direction, theoretical upper bounds on some proof complexity measure give us hope of finding good proof search algorithms with respect to this measure, provided that we can design algorithms that search\nfor proofs in the system in an efficient manner. The field of proof complexity also has rich connections to algorithmic analysis, combinatorial optimization, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and mathematical logic. A few good\nsources providing more details are [6, 17, 47].\n</p> <h3>A Very Selective Survey of Proof Complexity</h3> \n <p>\nAny propositional logic formula can be converted to a formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) that is only linearly larger and is unsatisfiable if and only if the original formula is a tautology. Therefore, any sound and complete system that certifies the unsatisfiability of CNF formulas can be considered as a general propositional proof system. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe extensively studied resolution proof system, which appeared in [9] and began to be investigated in connection with automated theorem proving in the 1960s [21, 22, 48], is such a system where one derives new disjunctive clauses from an unsatisfiable CNF formula until an explicit contradiction is reached. Despite the apparent simplicity of resolution, the first superpolynomial lower bounds on proof size were obtained only after decades of study in 1985 [33], after which truly exponential size lower bounds soon followed in [15, 52]. It was shown in [8] that these lower bounds can be established by instead studying the width of proofs, i.e., the maximal size of clauses in the proofs, and arguing that any resolution proof for a certain formula must contain a large clause. It then follows by a generic argument that any such proof must also consist of very many clauses. Later research has led to a well-developed machinery for showing width lower bounds, and hence also size lower bounds, for resolution. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe more general proof system polynomial calculus (PC), introduced in [1, 16], instead uses algebraic geometry to reason about SAT. In polynomial calculus clauses are translated to multilinear polynomials over some (fixed) field, and a CNF formula F is shown to be unsatisfiable by proving that there is no common root for the polynomials corresponding to all the clauses, or equivalently that the multiplicative identity 1 lies in the ideal generated by these polynomials. Here the size of a proof is measured as the number of monomials in a proof when all polynomials are expanded out as linear combinations of monomials, and the\nwidth of a clause corresponds to the (total) degree of the polynomial representing the clause. It can be shown that PC is at least as strong as resolution with respect to both size and width/degree, and there are families of formulas for which PC is exponentially stronger.\n</p> \n <p> In the work [36], which served, interestingly enough, as a precursor to [8], it was shown that strong lower bounds on the degree of polynomial calculus proofs are sufficient to establish strong size lower bounds. In contrast to the situation for resolution after [8], however, this has not been followed by a corresponding development of a generally applicable machinery for proving degree lower bounds. For fields of characteristic distinct from 2 it is sometimes possible to obtain lower bounds by doing an affine transformation from {0, 1} to the \"Fourier basis\" {\u22121, +1}, an idea that seems to have appeared first in [13, 28]. For fields of arbitrary characteristic a powerful technique for general systems of polynomial equations was developed\nin [2], which when restricted to CNF formulas F yields that polynomial calculus proofs require high degree if the corresponding clause-variable incidence graphs G(F) are good enough bipartite expander graphs. There are several provably hard formula families for which this criterion fails to apply, however, and even more formulas that are believed to be hard for both resolution and PC, but where lower bounds are only known for the former\nproof system and not the latter. \n</p> \n <p>\nAnother proof system that has been the focus of much research is cutting planes (CP), which was introduced in [20] as a way of formalizing the integer linear programming algorithm in [14, 27]. Here the disjunctive clauses in a CNF formula are translated to linear inequalities, and these linear inequalities are then manipulated to derive a contradiction. Thus, questions about the satisfiability of Boolean formulas are reduced to the geometry of polytopes over the real numbers. Cutting planes is easily seen to be as least as strong as resolution, since a CP proof can mimic any resolution proof line by line. An intriguing fact is that encodings of the pigeonhole principle, which are known to be hard to prove for resolution [33] and many other proof systems, are very easy to prove in cutting planes. It follows from this that not only is\ncutting planes never worse than resolution, but it can be exponentially stronger.\n</p> \n <p>Exponential lower bounds on proof length for cutting planes were first proven in [10] for the restricted subsystem CP, where all coefficients in the linear inequalities can be at most polynomial in the formula size, and were later extended to general CP in [34, 44]. The proof technique in [44] is very specific, however, in that it works by interpolating monotone Boolean\ncircuits for certain problems from CP proofs of related formulas with a very particular structure, and then appealing to lower bounds in circuit complexity. A longstanding open problem is to develop techniques that would apply to other formula families. For example, establishing that randomly sampled k-CNF formulas are hard to refute for CP, or that CP cannot efficiently prove the fact that the sum of all vertex degrees in an undirected graph is\neven (encoded in so-called Tseitin formulas), would constitute major breakthroughs.\n</p> \n <p> We remark that there are also other proof systems inspired by linear and semidefinite programming, e.g., in [38, 39, 50], which are somewhat similar to but incomparable with cutting planes, and a deeper understanding of which appear even more challenging. Some notable early papers in proof complexity investigating these so-called semialgebraic proof systems were published around the turn of the millennium in [30, 31, 45], but then this area\nof research seems to have gone dormant. In the last few years, these proof systems have made an exciting reemergence in the context of hardness of approximation, revealing unexpected and intriguing connections between approximation and proof complexity. A precursor to this is the work by Schoenebeck [49], which gave strong integrality gaps in the so-called\nLasserre SDP hierarchy using results from proof complexity. These results were later realized to be a rediscovery of results by Grigoriev [29] proving degree lower bounds for what he called the Positivstellensatz Calculus [31]. More recently we have the work of Barak et al. [4], which was the first to explicitly point out this intriguing connection between approximability\nand proof complexity. Following this paper, several papers have appeared that continue the fruitful exploration of the interplay between approximability and proof complexity. Results from this area also appeared in the invited talk of Boaz Barak at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014 (see [5]).\n</p> \n <p>The paper [19] initiated research in proof complexity focused on a more general and powerful family of propositional proof systems called Frege systems. Such systems consist of a finite implicationally complete set of axioms and inference rules (let us say over connectives AND, OR, and NOT for concreteness), where new formulas are derived by substitution into the axioms and inference rules. Various forms of Frege systems (also called Hilbert systems) typically appear in logic textbooks, and typically the exact definitions vary. Such distinctions do not matter for our purposes, however\u2014it was shown in [19] that all such systems are equivalent up to an at most polynomial blow-up in the proof size.\n</p> \n <p>\nFrege systems are well beyond what we can prove nontrivial lower bounds for; the situation is similar to the problem of proving lower bound on the size of Boolean circuits. Therefore restricted versions of Frege systems have been studied. One natural restriction is to allow unbounded fan-in AND-OR formulas (where negations appear only in front of atomic variables) but to require that all formulas appearing in a proof have bounded depth (i.e., a bounded number of alternations between AND and OR). Such a model is an analogue of the bounded-depth circuits studied in circuit complexity, but first arose in the context\nof bounded first-order arithmetic in logic [12, 41]. For such bounded-depth Frege systems exponential lower bounds on proof size were obtained in [37, 42], but these lower bounds only work for depth smaller than log log n. This depth lower bound was very recently improved to sqrt{log n} in [43], but in terms of the size lower bound this recent result is much weaker. By comparison, for the corresponding class in circuit complexity strong size lower bounds are\nknown all the way up to depth log n/ log log n. Also, if one extends the set of connectives with exclusive or (also called parity) to obtain bounded-depth Frege with parity gates, then again no lower bounds are known, although strong lower bounds have been shown for the analogous class in circuit complexity [46, 51].\n</p> \n <p>\nThe quest for lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege systems and beyond are mainly motivated by the P vs. NP problem. Regarding connections to SAT solving, it is mostly weaker proof systems such as resolution, polynomial calculus, and cutting planes that are of interest, whereas the variants of Frege systems discussed above do not seem to be suitable foundations for SAT solvers. The issue here is that not only do we want our proof system to be as powerful as possible, i.e., having short proofs for the formulas under consideration, but\nwe also want to be able to find these proofs efficiently.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe quantify this theoretically by saying that a proof system is automatizable if there is an algorithm that finds proofs in this system in time polynomial in the length of an optimal proof. This seems to be the right notion: If there is no short proof of a formula in the system, then we cannot expect any algorithm to find a proof quickly, but if there is a short proof to be found we want an algorithm that is competitive with respect to the length of such a proof. Unfortunately, there seems to be a trade-off here in the sense that if a proof system is sufficiently powerful, then it is not automatizable. For instance, bounded-depth Frege systems are not automatizable under plausible computational complexity assumptions [11]. However, analogous results have later been shown also for resolution [3], and yet proof search is implemented successfully in this proof system in practice. This raises intriguing questions that seem to merit further study.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>There is a rich selection of open problems that could be discussed at a workshop focused on proof complexity. Below we just give a few samples of such problems that came up during the workshop\u2013it should be emphasized that this list is very far from exhaustive and is only intended to serve as an illustration.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor starters, there are a number of NP-complete problems for which we would like to understand the hardness with respect to polynomial calculus and other algebraic proof systems. For the problem of cliques of constant size k in graphs, there is an obvious polynomial-time algorithm (since only mbox{binom{n}{k} leq n^k} possible candidate cliques need to be checked). Whether this brute-force algorithm is optimal or not is a deep question with connections to fixed-parameter tractability and parameterized proof complexity. This is completely open for polynomial calculus, and even for resolution. The ultimate goal here would be to prove average-case lower bounds for k-clique formulas over Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs G(n, p) with edge probability just below the threshold p = n^{-2//(k-1)} for the appearance of k-cliques. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn contrast to the clique problem, graph colouring is NP-complete already for a constant number 3 of colours. If we believe that P \u2260 NP, then, in particular, it seems reasonable to expect that this problem should be hard for polynomial calculus. No such results have been known, however. On the contrary, in the papers [23, 24, 25] recognized with the INFORMS Computing Society Prize 2010, the authors report that they used algebraic methods formalizable in polynomial calculus that \"successfully solved graph problem instances having thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of edges\" and that they could not find hard\ninstances for these algorithms. This is very surprising. For resolution, it was shown in [7] that random graphs with the right edge density are exponentially hard to deal with, and it seems likely that the same should hold also for polynomial calculus. This appears to be a very challenging problem, however, but we hope that techniques from [2, 40] can be brought to bear on it.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor cutting planes, a longstanding open problem is to prove lower bounds for random k-CNF formulas or Tseitin formulas over expander graphs. An interesting direction in the last few years has been the development of new techniques for size-space trade-offs, showing that if short cutting planes proofs do exist, such proofs must at least have high space complexity in that they require a lot of memory to be verified. Such results were first obtained via a somewhat unexpected connection to communication complexity in [35], and have more\nrecently been strengthened in [26, 32].\n</p> \n <p>\nAdmittedly, proving lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege systems and beyond is another formidable challenge, and it only seems prudent to say that this is a high-risk proposal. However, the very recent, and exciting, progress in [43] give hope that new techniques might be developed to attack also this problem.\n</p> \n <h3>Relation to Previous Dagstuhl Seminars</h3> \n <p>The area of proof complexity has a large intersection with computational complexity theory, and are two recurring workshops at Dagstuhl dedicated to complexity theory broadly construed, namely <em>Computational Complexity of Discrete Problems</em> and <em>Algebraic Methods in Computational Complexity</em>. However, these two workshops have had very limited coverage\nof topics related to proof complexity in the past.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the more applied side, there have been two workshops <em>SAT and Interactions</em> and <em>Theory and Practice of SAT Solving</em> that have explored the connections between computational complexity and more applied\nsatisfiability algorithms as used in industry (so-called SAT\nsolvers). These workshops have focused on very weak proof systems,\nhowever, which are the ones that are of interest in connection to SAT\nsolving, but have not made any connections to stronger proof systems or to bounded arithmetic.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough proof complexity has turned out to have deep connections to\nboth complexity theory and SAT solving, proof complexity is an interesting and vibrant enough area to merit a seminar week in its own right. This workshop at Dagstuhl provided a unique opportunity for the community to meet during a full week focusing on the latest news in various subareas and major challenges\ngoing forward.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Michael Alekhnovich, Eli Ben-Sasson, Alexander A.

            "data": "\n <p>\n<em>Cyber-Physical Systems</em> (CPS) are complex systems resulting from intricate interaction of discrete computational devices with the continuous physical plants. \nWithin CPS, embedded control software plays a significant role by monitoring and adjusting several physical variables, e.g. temperature, velocity, pressure, density, and so on, through feedback loops where physical processes interact with computational devices. \nRecent advances in computation, storage, and networking have made tremendous advances in hardware and system platforms for CPS. \nWith this growing trend in computational devices, embedded control software is becoming more and more ubiquitous in many safety-critical applications including automotive, aerospace, transportation systems, critical infrastructure, energy, robotics, healthcare, and many other domains. \nUnfortunately, the design of embedded control software nowadays is still based on ad-hoc solutions resulting in brittle and error-prone software, and very high verification and validation costs. In order to detect and eliminate design flaws and inevitable software bugs, a large portion of the design budget is consumed with validation and verification efforts, which are often lengthy. On the other hand, by changing the emphasis from verification to synthesis, it is possible to synthesize correct-by-design embedded control software for CPS while providing formal guarantees of correctness and preventing the need for costly post facto verification. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn recent years, there has been a lot of progress in designing automatic and correct-by-construction techniques for controller synthesis for interacting discrete and continuous systems. These new techniques have combined techniques from continuous control theory as well as from computer science.\nThe focus of this seminar was to provide a state-of-the-art of this nascent but important field, and to describe challenges and opportunities for synthesis techniques to transition to the real world.\nBy the nature of the topic, the participation at the seminar was inter-disciplinary, and consisted of computer scientists and control theorists, both from academia and from industry.\nInstead of a sequence of presentations of individual research results, the seminar was organized as a sequence of open discussions on topics of common interest to the participants, such as techniques for scalable controller synthesis, identification of application domains and recent success stories, compositionality and system design, end-to-end arguments about systems, as well as education and outreach. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar benefitted the control as well as computer science communities by bridging the gap between many complementary concepts studied in each community. A more detailed survey on the topics of the seminar is in preparation.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes of the seminar</h3> \n <p>The  seminar focused on the challenges in the application of formal\nsynthesis techniques for automatic, correct-by-construction synthesis of CPS.\nThe seminar had a total of 45 participants with a mix of computer\nscientists and control theorists.\n</p> \n <h3>Sessions</h3> \n <p>The seminar was organized as a sequence of open discussions led by one or two moderators. Each session had a scribe to note down the discussion. The scribe notes were shared with all participants, who added their comments or filled in more information. The updated notes were used to prepare the session summaries (in the next Section).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following sessions were organized:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Application domains, success stories, and obstacles to adoption\n</li><li>\n  Fundamental algorithmic and scalability challenges in formal synthesis\n</li><li>\n  Tools and infrastructure\n</li><li>\n  Education and outreach\n</li><li>\n  Data-driven and search-driven approaches to synthesis\n</li><li>\n  Compositionality in synthesis\n</li><li>\n  Optimality and completeness\n</li><li>\n  Synthesis of distributed protocols from scenarios and requirements.\n</li><li>\n  Specification languages \n</li><li>\n  Robustness and resiliency\n</li><li>\n  Explainability and user interaction\n</li><li>\n  End-to-end correctness\n</li><li>\n  Formal synthesis challenges in robotics\n</li><li>\n  Cyber-Security of CPS\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Calin A.

            "title": "Topology, Computation and Data Analysis",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar titled \"Topology, Computation, and Data Analysis\" brought together researchers in mathematics, computer science, and visualization to engage in active discussions on theoretical, computational, practical, and application aspects of topology for data analysis. The seminar has led to stronger ties between the computational topology and TopoInVis (topology based visualization) communities and identification of research challenges and open problems that can be addressed together. \n</p> \n <h3>Context</h3> \n <p>\nTopology is the study of connectivity of space that abstracts away geometry and provides succinct representations of the space and functions defined on it.  Topology-based methods for data analysis have received considerable attention in the recent years given its promise to handle large and feature-rich data that are becoming increasingly common.  Computing topological properties in the data domain and/or range is a step in the direction of more abstract, higher-level data analysis and visualization.  Such an approach has become more important in the context of automatic and semi-automatic data exploration, analysis, and understanding. The primary attraction for topology-based methods is the ability to generate \"summary\" qualitative views of large data sets. Such views often require fewer geometrical primitives to be extracted, stored, and to be visualized as compared to views obtained directly from the raw data. Two  communities,  computational  topology  and  TopoInVis  (topology based  visualization),  have made significant progress during the past two decades on developing topological abstractions and applying  them  to  data  analysis.   In  addition,  there  are  multiple  other  research  programs  (relatively fewer in number) on this topic within the statistics and machine learning fields, and within a few application domains.  Computational topology grew from within computational geometry and algebraic topology and studies algorithmic questions on topological structures.  The focus of topological data analysis and TopoInVis is data - algorithms, methods, and systems for improved and intuitive understanding of data via application of topological structures.  Researchers in computational topology typically have a math or theoretical computer science background whereas TopoInVis researchers have a computational, computer engineering, or applied background. There is very little communication between the two communities due to the different origins and the fact that there are no common conferences or symposia where both communities participate.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>The Dagstuhl seminar 17292 (July 2017) successfully brought together researchers with mixed background to talk about  problems  of  mutual  interest.   Following this seminar, the  benefits  of  the  inter-community ties was well appreciated, at least by the attendees of the seminar.  The goal of the current seminar was to strengthen existing ties, establish new ones, identify challenges that requires the two communities to work together, and establish mechanisms for increased communication and transfer of results from one to the other. During the previous Dagstuhl seminar, we also noticed significant interaction between researchers within the individual communities,  with say theoretical and applied backgrounds.  We wanted to continue to encourage such interaction.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>\nWe chose four current and emerging topics that will benefit from an inter-community discussion.  Topics are common to both communities, with different aspects studied within an individual community.  \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Reeb  graphs,  Reeb  Spaces,  and  Mappers.</b> The  Reeb  graph,  its  loop-free  version  called  the contour  tree,  and  the  higher-dimensional  generalization called the Reeb  space  are  topological  structures that capture the connectivity of level sets of univariate or multivariate functions.  They are independently well studied within the computational topology and TopoInVis communities.  Recent developments define stable distance measures between Reeb graphs, inspired by analogous distance measures in persistent homology.  Barring a few exceptions, the theoretical results have no practical realizations.  On the practical side, effective visual exploration and visual analysis methods based on Reeb graphs and spaces have been developed for a wide variety of domains including combustion studies, climate science, astronomy, and molecular modeling.  These applications often utilize only a simplified version of the topological structure. One such simplification, the mapper algorithm, consists of a discretized version of Reeb graphs and has shown an immense industrial potential. Very recently, the theoretical aspects of the mapper algorithm and its generalizations has moved in the focus of research.  Exchange of ideas and results between the two communities will help advancing this progress further. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Topological analysis and visualization of multivariate data.</b> Multivariate datasets arise in many scientific applications.  Consider, for example, combustion or climate simulations where multiple physical measurements (say, temperature and pressure) or concentrations of chemical species are computed simultaneously. We model these variables mathematically as multiple continuous, real-valued functions. We are interested in understanding the relationships between these functions, and more generally, in developing efficient and effective tools for their analysis and visualization. Unlike for real-valued functions, very few tools exist for studying multivariate data topologically. Besides the aforementioned Reeb spaces and mappers, notable examples of these tools are the Jacobi sets, Pareto sets, and Joint Contour Nets.  Understanding the theoretical properties of these tools and adapting them in analysis and visualization remains a very active research area. In addition, combining these topological tools with multivariate statistical analysis would be of interest. On the other hand, research towards multidimensional persistence would help advance multivariate data analysis both mathematically and computationally. We plan to expand our discussion on multidimensional persistent homology that include topics such as identifying meaningful and computable topological invariants; discussing computability and applicability in the multidimensional setting, comparison of multidimensional data, kernel methods for multidimensional persistence, and adapting multidimensional persistence in visualization.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>New opportunities for vector field topology.</b> Vector field topology for visualization pioneered by Helman and Hesselink has inspired much research in topological analysis and visualization of vector fields. A large body of work for time-independent vector field deals with fixed (critical) points, invariant sets, separatrices, periodic orbits, saddle connectors and Morse decomposition as well as vector field simplification that reduces its complexity.  Research for time-dependent vector field is concerned with critical point tracking, Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE), Lagrangian coherent structure (LCS), streak line topology, as well as unsteady vector field topology. For this workshop, we ask the following questions:  can advancements in computational topology help bring new opportunities for the study of vector field topology? In particular, can they help developing novel, scalable and mathematically rigorous ways to rethink vector field data? An example is the topological notion of robustness, a cousin of persistence, introduced via the well diagram and well group theory. Robustness has been shown to be very useful in quantifying feature stability for steady and unsteady vector fields. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Software tools and libraries.</b> How do we make topological data analysis applicable to large datasets? A natural first step is algorithm and software engineering. This refers to developing the best algorithms for a particular problem and to optimize the implementation of these algorithms. The state of affairs within the communities is quite diverse: while scalable algorithms are available for some problems(e.g., computation of Reeb graphs or persistence diagrams in low dimensions), current developments make significant progress on other fronts, for example the computation of approximate persistence diagrams of Vietoris-Rips complexes.  On the other extreme, the theory of multi-dimensional persistence is just beginning to be supported by algorithmic contributions.  Besides these efforts, parallelizable and distributed algorithms play an important role towards practicality. One further important aspect of software design is interface design, that is, to make those implementations available to non-experts. While this final development step is usually rather neglected in theoretical research, there have been efforts in both communities towards generally applicable and easy-to-use software.  Software contributors of both communities will profit from exchanging ideas and experiences.\n</p> \n <h3> Participants, Schedule, and Organization</h3> \n <p>The invitees were identified according to the focus topics of the seminar while ensuring diversity in terms of gender, country / region of workplace, and experience. The aim was to bring together sufficient number of experts interested in each topic and representing the two communities to facilitate an engaging discussion. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe planned for different talk types, longer overviews and shorted contributed research talks, and breakout sessions. We scheduled six overview talks on the first day. These overview talks were aligned with the four topics of the seminar, planned to be accessible to members of both communities, and set the stage for the discussions and shorter research talks on the following days. The speakers Ulrich Bauer (Reeb graphs),  Christoph Garth (topology based methods in visualization), Gunther Weber (topological analysis for exascale), Michael Lesnick (computational aspects of 2-parameter persistence) Claudia Landi (multi-parameter persistence), and Vanessa Robins (discrete Morse theory and image analysis) gave a gentle introduction to the area followed by a state-of-the-art report and discussion on open problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nParticipants gave short research talks (16 total) during Tuesday-Friday with a focus on challenges and opportunities. These talks were organized during the morning sessions. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe scheduled breakout sessions on the afternoons of Tuesday and Thursday. On Tuesday, we solicited discussion topics and identified three topics to be of interest - <em>multivariate data, reconstruction,</em> and <em>tensor field topology</em>. Participants chose to join a group based on their interest. All groups contained participants from both communities. We  formed two discussion groups with inputs from experts on multi-parameter persistence who were part of a different group on Tuesday. The second breakout session was on <em>Multi-parameter persistence computation</em>, where they discussed and analyzed a recently proposed algorithm. All groups presented a summary of their discussion and plans during a plenary session at the end of the day. \n</p> \n <p>\nMany participants joined an organized excursion to Bernkastel-Kues on Wednesday afternoon. On Friday morning, we scheduled a discussion and brainstorming session to close the seminar and and to plan for future events.\n</p> \n <h3>Results and Reflection</h3> \n <p>\nParticipants unanimously agreed that the seminar was successful in enabling cross-fertilization and identifying important challenging problems that require both communities to work together. The breakout sessions were instrumental in identifying some of the challenges and topics for further collaboration. At least two such challenges (together with motivating applications) were identified, possibly leading to collaboratory efforts. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe breakout sessions were planned for the entire afternoon after lunch. The longer duration allowed for in-depth and technical discussions that stimulates further work after the seminar. Based on feedback during informal discussions and the brainstorming session on Friday, we expect multiple working groups will be formed to write expository articles and survey articles. Members of the two communities have also shown enthusiasm to participate in workshops and conferences of each other. In conclusion, we believe that the seminar has achieved the goal of bringing together the two communities and charting a path for tackling bigger challenges in the area of topological data analysis.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michael Kerber, Vijay Natarajan, and Bei Wang\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Artificial and Computational Intelligence in Games: AI-Driven Game Design",
            "data": "\n <p>The video game industry has been developing rapidly in the past decade. Whereas ten years ago video games were almost exclusively aimed at entertainment, nowadays they are used in a variety of places in everyday life. All kinds of organizations now use video games for simulation and training. Educational institutes use video games to enrich and replace parts of courses. Governmental and health care agencies use video games to educate people and stimulate them to lead more productive lives. On top of that, the entertainment-focused games industry continues to grow and is a major industry both culturally and financially.\n</p> \n <p>\nTwo parallel developments can be observed in the games industry. On the one hand, the high-profile entertainment games (\"triple-A games\") see a steady increase of time and financial resources invested in their development, to keep up with technological advances and to be able to compete in a tough market. On the other hand, the number of smaller, special-purpose games in development (including so-called \"serious games\") increases dramatically too, in particular in research, training, and education. Moreover, as the pervasiveness of video games increases, so does the the number of people involved in creating them. The job of creating games is no longer limited to specialist programmers and artists. Instead, those who need to use the games become heavily involved in their creation.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe serious-games domain poses additional challenges to game development beyond all the challenges already posed by games for entertainment, namely the need for a strong relation with the \"real world\". Serious games often have a purpose in training, which entails that the game worlds must be a realistic depiction of the actual environment in which user functions, in particular where \"behaviors\" are concerned. The big data revolution means that huge quantities of data about the real world are becoming available along with the means of processing them, which may offer the possibility to automatically construct games on the basis of such data. This is a particularly enticing notion, given the financial constraints for constructing serious games, which means that professional content producers might not be available.\n</p> \n <p>    \nFurthermore, new computer games are expected to much better incorporate the different needs of a wide variety of customers, to provide more alternative modes, solution paths, incentives, emotional states, and difficulty levels. Game design, and especially balancing, must take this into account. However, this increases the complexity of design and production considerably, such that AI-based tools that can assist the human developer or even partly automatize processes are more desired than ever.\n</p> \n <p>\nSummarizing, we note the following four trends in modern game development:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Technological advances have lead to an increased challenge in developing modern video games, even for expert game developers\n</li><li>There is an increased need for non-experts to be able to design and develop games\n</li><li> There is an increased need for realism in the virtual world behaviors, in particular in the area of serious games\n</li><li> A greater variety of players and a better availability of data about players leads to the need for more variable and better customizable games, which require a more complex development process.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nA solution for each of these issues can be found in the application of artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques to drive the design and development of games. From the perspective of AI-driven game design, AI supports or even takes over the role of the human game developer in creating particular elements of a game, and even complete new games.\n </p> \n <p>  \nWhile the game industry tends to use a small selection of well-known algorithms to generate elements of game worlds (in particular where graphics and animation are concerned), the use of AI to create new environments, new behaviors of virtual characters, new narratives, new game rules, or even new gameplay mechanisms is at present limited to a very small number of researchers. We see it, however, as the main direction in which innovation in game design and development can be found.\n</p> \n <p>\nAI-driven game design sees applications in the design of virtual worlds, virtual characters, narratives, and game mechanics. Moreover, it can be used to assist in the human design process, and to adapt games automatically after publication.  Finally, it can support the automated analysis of generated game elements. Each of these topics is a research domain by itself, which requires an interdisciplinary approach which borrows from computer science, psychology, cognitive science, and even the creative arts. A common ground is found in artificial intelligence techniques, in particular machine learning. \n</p> \n <p>\nFor this seminar, we brought together computer scientists and creative experts with the common goals of gaining a deeper understanding of various aspects of games, and of further improving games, in particular by using AI-techniques used to generate games and game elements. The goal was to look beyond what is currently possible and in use, and take steps towards the future of AI-driven game development. Besides theoretical discussions, part of the seminar was spent on trying to achieve first practical results. \n</p> \n <p>\nReports on the discussions and results achieved are found on the following pages. All in all, the organizers and participants deemed the seminar a great success, and are eager to continue into some of the directions that were focused on during the week at Schloss Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Elisabeth Andr\u00e9, Michael Cook, Mike Preu\u00df, and Pieter Spronck\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe rise of technology that can support the active human body - in contrast to the previously prevalent paradigm of interacting with computers while sitting still - such as wearables, quantified self systems and mobile computing highlights an opportunity for a new era of \"body-centric computing\". However, most work in this area has taken quite an instrumental perspective, focusing on achieving extrinsic performance objectives. Phenomenology, however, highlights that it is also important to support the experiential perspective of living an active life, that is, technology should also help people focus on their lived experiences to deepen their understanding and engagement with their own bodies. We find that despite the work on embodiment, the use of technology to support the corporeal, pulsating, felt body has been notably absent. We believe the reason for this is due to limited knowledge about how to understand, analyse and correlate the vast amount of data from the various sensors worn by individuals and populations in real-time so that we can present it in a way that it supports people's felt experience. In order to drive such an agenda that supports both instrumental and experiential perspectives of the active human body, this seminar brought together leading experts from industry and academia, including those who are central to the development of products and ideas relating to wearables, mobile computing, quantified self, data analysis and visualization, sports science, exertion games, computer sports science as well as phenomenology. The goal was to address key questions around the use of sensor data to support both instrumental and experiential perspective of the active human body and to jump-start collaborations between people from different backgrounds to pioneer new approaches for a body-centric computing future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Florian Mueller, Josh Andres, Joseph Marshall and Dag Svanes\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Reliable Computation and Complexity on the Reals",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar was a meeting between two groups of researchers working in the related areas of reliable computing and of computational complexity on real numbers. While the first area originates in numerical analysis, the second area goes back to the roots of computer science and and computability.\n</p> \n <p>\nReliable computations aims to produce correct answers to numerical problems with mathematical rigor. This includes to prove that the problem is solvable and to compute mathematically correct error bounds for the solution. Reliable numerical computations solely use floating-point arithmetic to take advantage of the tremendous speed. Naturally that poses limits on the problems which can be solved, in particular the condition number. However, in contrast to purely numerical methods, no false answers are possible: Either a\ntrue error bound is computed or, a corresponding error message is given.\nThere is a history of reliable numerical computations. In the early days,\ninterval arithmetic was often used in a rather naive way. Still the computed results were correct, however, often wide or no bounds at all were computed. Meanwhile it is well understood how to derive effective methods for reliable numerical computations, avoiding wide bounds and pushing the set of solved problems to the limit of that of purely numerical algorithms. A number of interesting and hard mathematical problems have been solved using reliable\nnumerical computations. This includes the famous Kepler conjecture, the\nexistence of mutually distinct solutions to certain partial differential equations, and more. Needless to say that solving a mathematical problem requires rigorous solutions of all particular problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nComputable analysis is a branch of computability theory studying those\nfunctions on the real numbers and related structures which can be computed by\nmachines\nsuch as digital computers. The increasing demand for reliable software in\nscientific\ncomputation and engineering requires a sound and broad foundation not only of\nthe analytical/\nnumerical but also of the computational aspects of real number computation.\nThe branch of computable analysis based on the definition by Grzegorczyk and\nLacombe of computable real functions (TTE, \"Type 2 Theory of Effectivity\")\nhas turned out to be particularly useful for investigating computability on\nuncountable sets. As a central concept computability appears as a\nspecialization of continuity. Meanwhile computability of numerous analytic\nproblems has been investigated (from basic analysis, functional analysis,\nordinary and partial differential equations, analytic functions, measure\ntheory, dynamical systems etc.). All these examples demonstrate the usefulness\nof the concept.\n</p> \n <p>\nOnce a problem has been shown computable, a natural next question asks\nfor the computational efficiency of such a solution. This is where real\nanalysis meets (discrete) complexity theory with notions of runtime and memory/space: asymptotically with respect to n\u2014&gt;infty  for approximating the output up to absolute error 2^{-n}. The famous Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe method for instance permits to compute billions of digits of transcendental within minutes; while Bloch's constant, although proven computable, is still not known up to error 2^{-5}. In fact the distinction between polynomial and exponential time, in the discrete realm gauged for instance by complexity classes P, NP, #P, and PSPACE, re-emerges in the real case: The bit-cost of computing the maximum of an arbitrary fixed smooth (i.e. infinitely often differentiable) polynomial-time computable f : [0; 1]-&gt;[0; 1]  has been shown to correspond to P-vs-NP; that of Riemann integration to #P; and that of solving an ordinary differential equation to PSPACE. On analytic\nfunctions on the other hand  these operations map polynomial-time\ncomputable instances back to polynomial-time computable results.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor practical purposes and in the spirit of \"algorithm engineering\", the\nasymptotic results from complexity theory have to be refined by considering\nthe efficiency of actual implementations. Corresponding software libraries are usually called \"exact real arithmetic\" (ERA) and implement real numbers in the sense of TTE. ERA implementations exist in many languages, like C, C++ JAVA, Haskell or OCaml. Internally, ERA has to perform operations on infinite data like {0,1}^omega. The user interface, however, hides the details and offers operations and functions on \"exact\" real numbers. In consequence, users do not need to care about aspects like rounding or truncation errors or the specification of precisions. Instead, they can concentrate on the mathematical\npart of the problem under consideration. As computable real functions have to be continuous, it is impossible to implement some widely used real functions (like testing on equality). In consequence, ERA cannot simply copy the double precision interface one-to-one, but needs to go its own ways. Additionally,\nfor the reason of efficiency the representations used in TTE have to be\ncarefully revised. The resulting speed is comparable to the use of multiple precision floating point numbers, but now without any need for manual precision control.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Norbert T.

            "data": "\n <p>\nComputational social choice (COMSOC) combines models from political science and economics with techniques from computer science, to analyze collective decision processes from a computational perspective. Classical contributions include the study of the computational barriers to various forms of manipulation in elections, the definition of novel procedures for distributed resources among a group of human or artificial agents, as well as the study of complex collective decisions such as multi-winner voting rules and voting in combinatorial domains. COMSOC is a thriving field of research, with an international bi-annual workshop now at its 7th edition and a handbook published in 2016 which structures more than a decade of research, but future success will depend on the practical applicability of its findings. The purpose of this seminar was to address this challenge by stimulating application-driven research in computational social choice, i.e., theoretical studies modeling existing practical problems in all their complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nFour areas of COMSOC, which have already proven or bear particular potential for synergies and applicability to real-life problems, were identified as the focus of the seminar. Each of these areas addresses present-day challenges that provide an opportunity for an interdisciplinary approach building on contributions from computer scientists, economists, mathematicians, and political scientists:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Recommender systems</b> is a very successful application that combines several artificial intelligence techniques. Indeed, there have been few other examples of autonomous reasoning tools with comparable impact and pervasiveness in practice. \n\n</li><li><b>Fair division</b> has already proven a successful testbed for the application of theoretical work, thanks for the recently launched Spliddit webpage, which provides a user-friendly implementation for a number of algorithms in this field. This experience poses a number of questions and challenges for application-oriented research in fair division and beyond, such as data collection and analysis, possibly leading to new theoretical problems.\n\n</li><li><b>Interactive democracy</b> comprises a variety of approaches to make democratic processes more engaging and responsive. For instance, successful design and implementation of online decision platforms presents a multidisciplinary research challenge. \n\n</li><li><b>Real electoral systems</b> often have features that are absent in the single or multi-winner systems analyzed in textbooks and scientific papers. Voting theory and computational methods can help to identify non-monotonicity problems of real electoral systems, to provide normative benchmarks for institutional design, and to conduct influence and performance comparisons of different voting arrangements.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 19381 \"Application-Oriented Computational Social Choice\" brought together 46 invited participants of 15 different nationalities from 4 different continents, with three additional participants choosing to attend our seminar before participating to the Heidelberg Laureate Forum. The list of participants included researchers in Computer Science, Economics, and Political Science, three researchers from the industry (Microsoft, IBM, WinSet Group), and a lab technician.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor each of the focus topics described above, a 1-hour survey was prepared by one of the participants, obtaining an up-to-date overview of current research in the field and its main open problems.\nEach survey was scheduled on a different day, with 26 regular talks by participants complementing them in the program. \nTwo rump sessions at the beginning of the week allowed a number of the participants to present \nrecent findings, open problems and on-going research in a quick and informal way, stimulating the discussion for the rest of the week.\n</p> \n <p>\nGiven the focus of the seminar on application-oriented research, a special session was dedicated to the presentation of software developed by researchers participating to the seminar. Voting platforms were presented (Whale \n<a href=\"https://whale.imag.fr/\">https://whale.imag.fr/</a> and OPRA <a href=\"https://opra.cs.rpi.edu/polls/main\">https://opra.cs.rpi.edu/polls/main</a>), a library for preference data (Preflib <a href=\"http://www.preflib.org/\">http://www.preflib.org/</a>), a platform for online deliberation and consensus building (Vilfredo <a href=\"https://www.vilfredo.org/\">https://www.vilfredo.org/</a>), \nas well as a number of tools to support experimental research in social choice.\nMoreover, the seminar hosted three live voting experiments during the week, two of which used a mobile experimental laboratory that was brought to Dagstuhl thanks to French CNRS and the help of a lab technician from University of Rennes. A detailed report of the experiments and an abstract of all the talks can be found below.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the beginning of the week short sessions were reserved for individual self-introductions and \nfor the proposition of potential group work. \nThe organisers chose not to organize groups in advance, but to let them form in an iterative fashion during the seminar. A number of proposals were first made, then discussed and adapted, before participants signed up for specific group sessions. \nA total of 6 hours during the week was dedicated to group works, which led to significant advancements - a detailed report can be read below.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, judging both from anecdotal personal feedback as well as the official results from the anonymous \"Survey for Dagstuhl Seminar 19381\" (with a median score of 10 out of 11 on the summary question \"All in all, how do you rate the scientific quality of the seminar?\" and similarly positive answers on the mix of participants, working atmosphere, etc.), the seminar was a very successful experience.\nIt stimulated an already thriving research field to explore more applied research topics and scout for real-world problems.\nIt allowed researchers to get first hand experience on how to run voting experiments, either on an Internet voting platform or in a laboratory, and allowed them to share their research practices.\nThe work conducted in the groups was overall fruitful, already resulting in some paper drafts under preparation. \nThe few suggestions for improvements mostly related to further broadening the mix of participants (more PhD students and junior researchers, more colleagues from nearby fields) and having a slightly less dense program (shorter talks, more time for work in small groups or unplanned activities).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers wish to thank all the Dagstuhl staff for their professional support, the participants of the seminar for their positive attitude and enthusiasm, and the two collectors for putting together the abstracts that compose this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Umberto Grandi, Stefan Napel, Rolf Niedermeier, and Kristen Brent Venable\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Modeling and Analysis of Semiconductor Supply Chains",
            "data": "\n <p>\nComplex manufacturing processes are the heart of semiconductor manufacturing. A semiconductor chip is a highly miniaturized, integrated circuit (IC) consisting of thousands of components. Semiconductor manufacturing starts with thin discs, called wafers, (typically) made of silicon. A large number of usually identical chips can be produced on each wafer by fabricating the ICs layer by layer in a wafer fabrication facility (wafer fab). The corresponding step is referred to as the Fab step. Next, electrical tests that identify the individual dies that are likely to fail when packaged are performed in the Probe facility. An electronic map of the condition of each die is made so that only the good ones will be used. The probed wafers are then sent to an Assembly facility where the good dies are put into an appropriate package. The assembled dies are sent to a test facility where they are tested to ensure that only good products are sent to customers. The tested devices are then sent to regional warehouses or directly to customers. Wafer fabrication and probe are often called the front-end and assembly and test are called the back-end.\n</p> \n <p>\nSupply chain management (SCM) problems have become more and more important in the last decade. This has been caused by the fact that front-end operations are often performed in highly industrialized nations, while back-end operations are typically carried out in countries where labor rates are cheaper. Moreover, there are centers of competencies (e.g. bumping) that may consist of only a few process steps that may be done in a different company owned facility or remotely by a subcontractor. These centers of competencies speed up innovations and reduce costs, but increase the complexity of SCM. \n</p> <p>\nThe semiconductor industry is capital intensive with the cost of an entire wafer fab up to nearly $10 billion US caused primarily by extremely expensive machines, some up to $100 million US each. The manufacturing process is very complex due to the reentrant flows in combination with very long cycle times and the multiple sources of uncertainty involved. Capacity expansions are very expensive and time-consuming. This kind of decision is based on demand forecasts for the next years. Because of the rapidly changing environment, the demand is highly volatile. Consequently, the forecast is rarely accurate. The semiconductor industry is an extreme field for SCM solutions from an algorithmic as well as from a software and information systems point of view. The huge size of the supply chains involved, the pervasive presence of different kinds of uncertainties and the rapid pace of change leads to an environment that places approaches developed in other industries under major stress. Modeling and analysis approaches that are successful in this industry are likely to find applications in other areas, and to significantly advance the state of the art in their fields (cf. [1]).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this seminar was to bring together researchers from different disciplines including information systems, computer science, industrial engineering, operations research, and supply chain management whose central interest is in modeling, analyzing, and designing complex and large-scale supply chains as in the semiconductor industry. Moreover, practitioners from the semiconductor industry who have frequently articulated their perception that academic research does not always address the real problems faced by the industry brought in their domain knowledge to make sure that progress towards applicability and feasibility would be made during this seminar. The seminar had 26 attendees from ten different countries (see participant list at the end of the report). We had participants from leading semiconductor companies Infineon Technologies and Intel Corp. as well as researchers who work closely with ST Microelectronics, Globalfoundries, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\n</p> \n <p>\nA primary purpose of the workshop was to extend the scope of the academic research community from single wafer fabs to the entire semiconductor supply chain. We show the principle architecture of the planning and control system of a semiconductor supply chain in Figure 1. \n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Objectives</h3> \n <p>\nThe first objective of the seminar consisted of developing a research agenda for semiconductor supply chain modeling and analysis topics. This includes innovative modeling approaches for supply chain network planning, demand planning, master planning, and detailed production planning and scheduling in semiconductor supply chains. But it also includes ideas on how to design the related future information systems.\n</p> \n <p>The research agenda was developed around the following two main topics:</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Topic 1: Novel planning and scheduling approaches that can deal with the complexity and stochasticity of the semiconductor supply chain:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Many planning approaches on the SC-level are based on (distributed) hierarchical and generally deterministic approaches to deal with the sheer complexity of the semiconductor supply chain. The role of anticipation of lower level behavior in upper level decision-making is still not well understood and has to be studied in more detail. Because a semiconductor supply chain contains many different, often autonomous decision-making entities including humans, negotiation approaches are typical in such distributed hierarchical systems for planning and control. It should be researched how such negotiation approaches can be automated and which decisions should be made by humans.\n</li><li>The overall cycle times in a typical semiconductor supply chain are on the order of 10 to 15 weeks. Therefore lead times have to be modeled in planning formulations. Using lead times as exogenous parameters in planning formulations leads to a well-known circularity because the cycle time depends in a nonlinear manner on the resource utilization which is a result of the release decisions made by the planning approach. Different types of clearing functions have to be researched in the semiconductor supply chain context.\n</li><li> Approaches to demand planning that take the product life cycle into account have to be studied. The interaction of demand planning and supply chain planning has to be investigated.\n</li><li>Different ways to anticipate stochasticity including robust optimization, approximate dynamic programming, and stochastic programming have to be researched in the semiconductor supply chain context.\n</li><li> Different ways to appropriately deal with stochasticity including rolling planning techniques and inventory holding strategies have to be studied. \n</li><li> Generation of scenarios and other distribution parameters for planning problems in supply chains using data mining techniques have to be researched.\n</li><li> Because of the complexity of supply chains, long computing times still hinder the usage of analytic solution approaches especially for what-if analysis. The role of state-of-the-art computing techniques including parallel computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) machines or Cloud computing techniques in decision-making for semiconductor supply chains has to be investigated.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Topic 2: Future information systems and supply chain management in the semiconductor industry:</b>\n<ul>\n<li> Understanding the limitations of today\u2019s packaged software for supply chain management in the semiconductor industry.\n</li><li> Proposing alternative software solutions including software agents and service-oriented computing for planning and scheduling applications in the supply chain context.\n</li><li> Integration concepts for state-of-the-art computing techniques to get models that are computationally tractable and address the different uncertainties encountered in this industry.\n</li><li> Approaches to embed real time simulation techniques in current and future information systems to support decision-making in semiconductor supply chains.\n</li><li> Understanding the interaction of human agents with information systems.\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul> \n <p>The implementation of ERP, APS, and MES systems in semiconductor supply chains provides both an opportunity and the need for development of supply-chain wide integrated production planning and scheduling solutions. Therefore, we think that the second topic is important and should be also addressed in the research agenda. Research related only to the first main topic is not sufficient. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe second objective of the seminar consisted of identifying the core elements of a conceptual reference model for planning and control of a supply chain in the semiconductor industry that can be used for analysis and performance assessment purposes and to foster a common understanding in the research community both in academia and industry. This included specifying reference planning and control activities, the major information flows, and their interaction with a reference system of a physical supply chain. Due to the inherent complexity of semiconductor supply chains it requires simulation of the physical supply chain to understand the interactions between the planning and control components and the physical supply chain, to find solution approaches to problems and to verify them in the risk-free simulation environment before implementing them. There are widely accepted reference (simulation) models for single wafer fabs, mainly developed in the Measurement and Improvement of Manufacturing Capacity (MIMAC) project (led by one of the organizers of this Dagstuhl seminar) 20 years ago that are still used by many academic researchers working with the semiconductor industry. \n</p> \n <p>\nExisting reference models on the planning and control level like the Supply Chain Operations (SCOR) reference model and the supply chain planning (SCP) matrix are too generic to be useful for detailed analysis and have to be refined considerably to cover the important domain-specific aspects of semiconductor supply chains. \n</p> \n <h3>The Process</h3> \n <p>In the opening session, the organizers welcomed the participants and acknowledged Infineon Technologies as a sponsor of the seminar. Next, the participants each introduced themselves. This was followed by an overview of the goals and objectives of the seminar and a detailed review of the seminar program including the ground rules for interactions. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe remainder of the day on Monday consisted of four industry overview talks (by Hans Ehm, Kenneth Fordyce, Chen-Fu Chien, and Irfan Ovacik) and a review of the literature related to modeling an analysis of semiconductor supply chains (by Lars M\"onch and Reha Uzsoy). Tuesday and half a day on Wednesday were devoted to presentations and discussions about the various elements of the semiconductor supply chain planning and control systems shown in Figure 1 above. See Table 1 for a list of topics and presenters and Section 3 for abstracts of the presentations.\n</p> \n <p>\nWednesday afternoon was the excursion that was enjoyed by the participants. Thursday was devoted to 3 breakout sessions with report outs on the topics in Table 2. Section 4 has the breakout report outs. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe first set of breakout sessions had four groups focus on the individual elements in Figure 1 and one group focus on a semiconductor supply chain reference model. The second set of breakouts had three groups consider the interaction between various elements in Figure 1, one group talked about the incorporation of humans in the supply chain, and one discussed how to go from the reference model to a specific semiconductor supply chain model instance. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe final Friday set of breakouts included three groups that discussed process models of multiple elements from Figure 1 and the flow of information needed between the elements to provide core elements of a reference model. Another group discussed the role of agents in a semiconductor company\u2019s supply chain. The final breakout group discussed the level of detail needed in a top down reference model. Friday consisted of a discussion on the required core elements of a reference model for semiconductor supply chains and a wrap-up session.\n</p> \n <h3>Key Take Aways</h3> \n <p>\nhere were a number of key findings and areas for future research that were identified in the seminar. We will first summarize some of the key findings and will follow this with some areas for future research. \n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the first findings was that the participants generally agreed that the different elements in Figure 1 are reasonably well understood by both the industrial and academic communities, but the interactions between the elements are less well understood. Having said this, a number of the software solutions for the elements are not geared toward the complexities of the semiconductor industry (e.g. ATP/APS systems are generally focused on profit maximization and ignore many of the system complexities).  Second, it appears that there are still limitations in solution approaches in practice such as: capacity generally is expressed without regard to mix; fixed lead times are generally still assumed despite research done on clearing functions for planning; and ignoring all but production lots when developing plans. Third, as indicated above both the industrial and academic participants generally agree that the integration of the decisions made by the different elements is often fairly ad hoc and could/should be improved. Finally, the participants generally agreed that there does not currently exist an adequate reference model for the semiconductor supply chain. In fact, there is not even a reasonable set of data sets that describe instances of the semiconductor supply chain such as the MIMAC datasets at the factory level. \nThere is some indication that a reference model and incorporating human behavior of the various decision makers on the supply chain level will help to better understand supply chains producing and containing semiconductors.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to the findings mentioned above, several areas for future research were identified. An overarching idea was that the future research should focus more on formulation of appropriate models because this is fundamentally more important than the actual solution techniques chosen. Some of the future research areas are included below:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Using event-driven process chains (EPCs) to model/visualize planning processes. \n</li><li> Developing better integration of various decisions made in the elements of Figure 1. \n</li><li> Combining rolling horizon strategies with demand forecast evolution models. \n</li><li> Incorporating sustainability aspects into supply chain models. \n</li><li> Developing stochastic model versions of current deterministic models. \n</li><li> Incorporating the behavior of human decision makers (this will be useful, but challenging). \n</li><li> Exploring the use of different simulation paradigms (systems dynamics, agent-based, hybrid models, reduced simulation models) to model and analyze semiconductor supply chains. \n</li></ul> \n <h3>Next Steps</h3> \n <p>As a way to further the discussion of and collaboration on the topics of the seminar, Prof. Lars M\u00f6onch, Prof. Chen-Fu Chien, Prof. St\u00e9phane Dauz\u00e8re-P\u00e9r\u00e8s, Hans Ehm, and Prof. John Fowler are guest editing a special issue of the <em>International Journal of Production Research</em> (IJPR) entitled <em>Modeling and Analysis of Semiconductor Supply Chains</em>. The deadline for submission is September 1, 2016. This date was selected to allow time for ideas created by the participants of the seminar to be incorporated into papers for the special issue.

            "title": "Beyond Adaptation: Understanding Distributional Changes",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe world is dynamically changing and non-stationary. This is reflected by the variety of methods that have been developed to detect changes and adapt to them. These contributions originate from various communities, including statistics, machine learning, data mining, and the evolving and adaptive systems community. Nevertheless, most of this research views the changing environment as a black-box data generator, to which models are adapted (Fig. 1).\n</p> \n <img alt=\"Figure 1 Black-Box Model Adaptation.\" src=\"/storage/media/0004/4645/inf_loops_2_Seite_1.png\" width=\"30%\"/> \n <caption><b>Figure 1</b> Black-Box Model Adaptation.</caption> \n <img alt=\"Figure 2 Understanding Distributional Change.\" src=\"/storage/media/0004/4646/inf_loops_2_Seite_2.png\" width=\"30%\"/> \n <caption><b>Figure 2</b> Understanding Distributional Change.</caption> \n <p>\nThe aim of this seminar was to put the focus on the distributional change itself, i.e., to make the process itself more transparent and a subject of research in its own right (Fig. 2). In its endeavour to understand causes, nature and consequences of distributional change, the seminar brought together researchers from communities in which related questions have already been studied, albeit in separate lines of research. These include <em>data stream mining, time series and sequence analysis, domain adaptation</em> and <em>transfer learning, subgroup discovery and emerging pattern mining.</em>\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Data stream mining</b> studies data that arrives either one-by-one or in batches over time, and where the data generating process is often non-stationary. This requires computationally efficient approaches that are capable to detect and adapt to distributional changes. In this literature, the latter are commonly denoted as <em>concept drift, population drift</em>, or <em>shift</em>. Related\nto this seminar are in particular the problems of identifying change or irregularities in data streams, such as <em>outlier detection [1], anomaly detection [2], change detection [3], change diagnosis [4], change mining [5], drift mining [6],</em> and <em>drift understanding</em> [7].\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Time series analysis</b> studies data observed over a time course typically exhibiting some time dependencies. The correspondence of distributional change in this literature are <em>distributional structural breaks</em> or <em>change points</em>. Thus, of particular interest are the problems of <em>statistical change point analysis</em>, see e.g. the books by [8, 9, 10] or recent survey articles [12, 13]. A different line of research focuses on smallest detection delay for changes in sequentially observed data, see e.g. the recent books by [14, 15]. Of recent interest are also methods for the localization of multiple change points also known as <em>data segmentation</em> methodology, see e.g. the recent survey articles [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Of further interests is an <em>early classification of time series</em> [21].\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Domain adaptation</b> and <b>transfer learning</b> study the problem of transferring knowledge  between domains or tasks. While there is not necessarily a temporal relationship between domains or tasks, distributional differences between domains are studied under the notion of <em>dataset shift</em>. Related problems of particular interest are <em>lifelong learning</em> [22] and <em>unsupervised domain adaptation</em> [23].\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Subgroup discovery</b> studies the problem of finding subgroups that show an unusual distribution for a target variable. There is not necessarily a temporal relationship between subgroup. Of particular interest is <em>exceptional model mining</em>, which studies the problem of finding subgroups, where a model fitted to that subgroup is somehow exceptional [24]. Another related area is <em>emerging pattern mining</em> [25] for identifying emerging trends in\ntime-stamped databases.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics Discussed in the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar identified several key research questions around understanding distributional changes:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Understanding the practical relevance of different scenarios and types of change.\n</li><li> How to model such types of change effectively.\n</li><li> How to detect, verify, and measure types of change.\n</li><li> How to effectively adapt prediction models to the different types of change.\n</li><li> How to establish bounds for distributional change, or for predictive performance under change.\n</li><li> How to visualise change, and how to highlight individual types of change.(interactively).\n</li><li> How to evaluate techniques for the above questions.\n</li></ol> \n <p>Due to the limited time, discussion has focused mostly on the first four research questions, with plans to address the remaining questions in a follow-up seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Program Overview</h3> \n <p>This one-week seminar was structured such that plenary sessions formed a frame around parallel break-out group sessions. It was opened with plenary sessions on Monday and Tuesday morning, where four tutorial served to establish a common vocabulary and understanding between the participants from the different communities. In the subsequent four half-days, 13 spotlight talks were organised, each followed by discussions in break-out groups, and each closing by a short bring-back plenary session. The seminar closed by two plenary sessions on Friday morning, where action plans for further steps on research and collaboration were discussed.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>As detailed in the description of the sessions below, and in particular for the plenary session, differences in the terminology, concepts and common assumptions used in the different communities were identified as an important challenge towards common understanding of distributional changes. Therefore, a potential follow-up collaboration will focus on a joint publication that provides a mapping of terms and concepts. In particular, it should work out the notion of change (and representation) in data streams and time series, as well as in domain adaptation with multiple temporally connected source domains. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Shiblee Sadik and Le Gruenwald.

            "title": "Computation and Reconfiguration in Low-Dimensional Topological Spaces",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar was proposed as a followup to the Dagstuhl Seminars 17072: \"Applications of Topology to the Analysis of 1-Dimensional Objects\" and 19352: \"Computation in Low-Dimensional Geometry and Topology\". The goal of these seminars was to bring together researchers from different communities who are working on low-dimensional topological spaces (curves, embedded graphs, knots, surfaces, three-manifolds), in order to foster collaborations and synergies. Indeed, while the mathematical study of these objects has a rich and old history, the study of their algorithmic properties is still in its infancy, and new questions and problems keep coming from theoretical computer science and more applied fields, yielding a fresh and renewed perspective on computation in topological spaces. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe success of previous seminars demonstrated that research in low-dimensional topology is very active and fruitful, and also that there was a strong demand for a new seminar gathering researchers from the various involved communities, namely geometric topology and knot theory, computational geometry and topology, all the way to graph drawing and trajectory analysis. \n</p> \n <p>\n  For this iteration we placed a particular emphasis on topics related to geometric and topological <b>reconfiguration</b>: How can one structure be changed into another? How far apart are two structures? Such questions lie at the heart of various geometric problems such as computing the Fr\u00e9chet distance as a way to quantify curve similarity, or morphing between two versions of a common graph. In many cases, the combinatorics and the geometry of a reconfiguration space also emerged as important objects of study: examples include associahedra, the flip graphs of triangulations, and the curve complexes in geometric topology.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with four overview talks given by researchers in geometric topology, computational geometry, topological dynamics, and graph drawing to motivate and propose open problems that would fit the diverse backgrounds of participants and the specific focus on reconfiguration chosen for this year's workshop. This was followed by an open problem session where we gathered fifteen open problems, some of which were circulated in advance of the meeting. The remainder of the week was spent actively working on solving these problems in small groups. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe Covid pandemic prevented many participants from attending the seminar physically, and the entirety of the seminar took place in a hybrid setting, with most working groups featuring both online and physical participants. In order to coordinate the progress, we used Coauthor, a tool designed for by Erik Demaine (MIT), which greatly facilitated the collaborations, and also allowed participants to have a record of the work when the seminar concluded. We also held two daily progress report meetings, allowing people to share progress and allow people to switch groups. In addition to the traditional hike, a virtual social meeting was held on Gather.town to foster interactions between the online and the physical participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe now briefly describe the problems that have been worked on, with a more in-depth survey of the problems and the progress being done being featured farther down in this Dagstuhl Report. Some more open problems that have been proposed but not worked on are also listed at the end of the document.\n</p> \n <p>\nTwo groups worked on questions pertaining to reconfiguring curves in the plane and on surfaces. The group 4.1 investigated problems inspired by nonograms, where one aims at introducing switches at intersections of curves in the plane to remove so-called popular faces. The group 4.5 looked at the reconfiguration graph obtained under the action of local moves on minimal closed (multi-)curves on surfaces, and whether such multi-curves could be realized as the set of geodesics of some hyperbolic metric on the surface.\n</p> \n <p>\nA different flavor of surfaces was studied by the group 4.4, who investigated how square-tiled surfaces could be transformed under the action of shears of cylinder blocks.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe working group 4.2 studied the longstanding problem of the computational complexity of evaluation the rotation distance between elimination trees in graphs. A different flip graph, namely the one of order-k Delaunay triangulations was the topic of study of group 4.7.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, two groups worked on motion of discrete objects in different contexts. The group 4.3 initiated a generalization of the classical theory of morphings of planar graph when one allows the morph to go through a third dimension. The group 4.6 investigated Turning machines, which is a simple model of molecular robot aiming to fold into specific shapes.\n</p> \n <p>\nAll in all, the seminar fostered a highly collaborative research environment by allowing researchers from very diverse backgrounds to work together on precise problems. While the hybrid setting proved to be a significant challenge, the quality of the equipment at Dagstuhl and the online tools that were used provided a practical way for all the participants to interact and to make progress on problems related to reconfiguration in geometric and topological settings.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Maike Buchin, Arnaud de Mesmay, Anna Lubiw, and Saul Schleimer\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Database Architectures for Modern Hardware",
            "data": "\n <p>\nOver the last years, the social and commercial relevance of efficient data management has led to the development of database systems as foundation of almost all complex software systems. Hence there is a wide acceptance of architectural patterns for database systems which are based on assumptions on classic hardware setups. However, the currently used database concepts and systems are not well prepared to support emerging application domains such as eSciences, Internet of Things or Digital Humanities. From a user's perspective, flexible domain-specific query languages or at least access interfaces are required, novel data models for these application domains have to be integrated, and consistency guarantees which reduce flexibility and performance should be adaptable according to the requirements. Finally, volume, variety, veracity as well as velocity of data caused by ubiquitous sensors have to be mastered by massive scalability and online processing by providing traditional qualities of database systems like consistency, isolation and descriptive query languages. At the same time, current and future hardware trends provide new opportunities such as:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>many-core CPUs: Next-generation CPUs will provide hundreds of compute cores already in the commodity range. In order to allow high degrees of\nparallelism some architectures already provide hardware support for the\nnecessary synchronization, e.g. transactional memory.  However, it is not\nclear yet how to fully utilize these degrees of parallelism and\nsynchronization mechanism for database processing.\n</li><li> co-processors like GPU and FPGA: Special-purpose computing units such as\n  GPUs and FPGAs allow for parallelism at much higher degrees accelerating\n  compute-intensive tasks significantly. Moreover, heterogeneous hardware designs such as coupled CPU-FPGA and CPU-GPU architectures represent a trend of close integration between classic hardware and emerging hardware.\n  However, such designs require new architectural concepts for data management.\n</li><li>novel storage technologies like NVRAM and SSD: Even modern in-memory\n  database system solutions rely mostly on block-based media (e.g. SSD and HDD)\n  for ensuring persistence of data. Emerging memory technologies such as\n  non-volatile memory (NVRAM) promise byte-addressable persistence with\n  latencies close to DRAM. Currently, the usage of this technology is discussed\n  for instant failure recovery of databases, but the role of NVRAM in future\n  data management system architectures is still open.\n</li><li> high-speed networks: Both in scale-up and scale-out scenarios efficient\n  interconnects play a crucial role. Today, high-speed networks based on 10\n  Gbit/s Ethernet or InfiniBand support already Remote DMA, i.e. direct access\n  to memory of a remote node. However, this requires to deal with\n  distributed systems properties (unreliability, locality) and it is still\n  unclear how database systems can utilize this mechanism.\n</li></ul> \n <p>In order to open up the exemplarily mentioned application domains together with exploiting the potential of future hardware generations it becomes necessary now to fundamentally rethink current database architectures.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the main challenges of this rethinking is that it requires expertise from different research disciplines: hardware design, computer architectures, networking, operating systems, distributed systems, software engineering, and database systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThus, the goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together researchers and practitioners from these areas representing both the software and hardware sides and therefore different disciplines to foster cross-cutting architectural discussions. In this way, the seminar extended the series of previous Dagstuhl seminars on database systems aspects, such as \"Robust Query Processing\" (10381, 12321, 17222) as well as \"Databases on Future Hardware\" (17101).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was organized into six working groups where the participants discussed opportunities and challenges in order to exploit different features of modern hardware and operating system primitives for data processing:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Database accelerators: Based on an analysis of use cases for database accelerators from the level of individual operators and algorithms up to the level of complex database tasks, the group discussed ways of exploiting and evaluating accelerator technologies as well as future research directions with respect to hardware acceleration in databases. \n</li><li> Memory hierarchies: The group discussed design recipes for database nodes with non-trival memory hierarchies containing not only disk and RAM but also non-volatile memory. Within such a hierarchy different caching strategies are employed: exclusive caching for functionally equivalent levels and inclusive caching for levels with different functionality.\n</li><li> Remote direct memory access: The group discussed ways of exploiting RDMA in data-intensive applications. Particularly, an interface providing a set of useful abstractions for network-aware data-intensive processing called DPI was proposed. Similar to MPI, DPI is designed as an interface that can have multiple implementations for different networking technologies to enable the exploitation of RDMA and in-network processing.\n</li><li> Heterogeneous database architectures: This topic was addressed by two working groups. Both groups discussed a database software architecture that is capable of making use of multiple hardware devices (GPU, TPU, FPGA, ASICs), in addition to the CPU for handling database workloads. The principle goal was an architecture that would never be worse than a state-of-the-art CPU-centered database architecture, but would get significant benefit on those workloads were the heterogeneous devices can exploit their strengths. The first group developed a morsel-driven architecture, where pipelines are broken up into sub-pipelines and adaptive execution strategies are exploited. The second group discussed operating system support and primitives for heterogeneous architectures.\n</li><li> Machine learning in database systems: The goal of this working group was to investigate the application of machine learning methods for estimating operator selectivities as part of query optimization. Such an approach could overcome the inaccuracies of traditional cost estimation techniques especially for queries comprised of complex predicates and multiple joins.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe progress and outcome of the individual working groups was presented in a daily plenary session, details of the results are given below.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Gustavo Alonso, Michaela Blott, Jens Teubner: Databases on Future Hardware (Dagstuhl\nSeminar 17101).

For example, one of the ad hoc discussions centered around the mechanisms and person-to-person considerations that enable transfer of new techniques from academia to industry. Another discussion focused on bridging the divide between geometric modeling and engineering analysis. A third focused on the usage (or lack thereof) of academic open-source libraries. And a fourth elucidated the different error measures that allow or prevent model reduction techniques for non-linear models (e.g. of elasticity) for given applications ranging from animation to product design.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was well-paced, avoiding densely-packed presentations. An emphasis was placed on time to formulate both specific and long range challenges.\nThe benchmark problem in Section 4 is an example of specific problems that clarify and contrast the competing approaches and objectives and  advertised the different strengths and the synergy of the areas: responses that permit two-sided error bounds, responses based on mathematical reformulation, applying advanced computational geometry and new software packages that leverage hierarchical spline software.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    J\u00f6rg Peters\n                </div> \n",

It has triggered numerous research developments and gave rise to the concept of artificial neural networks as a computational paradigm designed to mimic aspects of signal and information processing in the human brain.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere have been several key advances in this area including the concept of back- propagation learning (essentially gradient descent and chain rule differentiation on the network weight vectors) by Werbos in 1974, later popularized in the celebrated 1984 paper of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams.

            "data": "\n <p>\nWith the advent of cyber-physical systems increasingly penetrating our\nlife, we are facing an ever-growing and permanent dependency on their\nreliable availability, continued function, and situationally adequate\nbehavior even in highly sensitive application domains. As cyber-physical systems comprise complex, heteromorphic software systems, their reliability engineering calls for combinations of theories and methods traditionally considered separate. While we have recently seen some of the necessary combinations blossom, e.g. the theory of hybrid systems bridging continuous control with reactive systems, other areas remain less developed and explored. A prominent one is the role of numerics in cyber-physical systems: while it is\nobvious that cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on numerical software components, e.g., in signal processing or in state representation and extrapolation during situation assessment and planning, specific methods for addressing the issues associated, like consequences of numerical inaccuracy and methods for confining propagation of errors, are just in their infancy. This is in stark contrast to the use of numerics in more mature branches of computing,\nlike signal processing or numerical analysis, where quantization\neffects as well as genesis and propagation of numerical error is\nwell-understood and dedicated methods for controlling it in critical\napplication, like various forms of interval-based numerical\nalgorithms, are readily available. The aforementioned ``traditional'' methods are, however, not versatile enough to cope with the\ncyber-physical setting, where numerical results, like state\nextrapolations over significant temporal horizons, enter into complex\nand safety-critical decision making, rendering error propagation\npotentially highly discontinuous. It seems that future critical\napplications, like automated driving contributing to the EU's \"Vision\nZero\" of eliminating fatalities in road-bound traffic, consequently\ncall for novel means of analyzing and controlling the impact of\nnumerics on system correctness, complemented by pertinent means of\nverification for establishing the safety case.  The germs of such\nmethods obviously have to be sought in the fields of design and\nverification of cyber-physical systems, i.e. in particular, (1) hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous systems, as well as (2) verified numerics,\narithmetic constraint solving also involving symbolic reasoning, and\n(3) planning and rigorous optimization in arithmetic domains. The\nseminar gathered  prominent researchers from all these\nfields in order to address the pressing problems induced by our\nsocietal dependence on cyber-physical systems.\n</p> \n <p>As argued above, bringing together researchers dealing with hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous systems, with verified numerics in arithmetic\nconstraint solving, and with planning and optimization in arithmetic\ndomains can help improve the state of the art in rigorously\ninterpreting and controlling cyber-physical phenomena. \nIn the sequel,\nwe review existing and potential contributions of the three fields to\nproblem solving in cyber-physical domains and sketch potentials for\ncross-fertilization, which was the aim of the proposed seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sergiy Bogomolov, Martin Fr\u00e4nzle, Kyoko Makino, and Nacim Ramdani\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 22111 on \u201cDatabase indexing and query processing\u201d assembled\nresearchers from industry and academia for the fourth time to discuss robustness issues in database query performance. The seminar gathered researchers around the world working on indexing, storage, plan generation and plan execution in database query processing, and in cloud-based massively parallel systems with the purpose to address the open research challenges with respect to the robustness of database management systems. Delivering robust query performance is well known to be a difficult problem for database management systems. All experienced DBAs and database users are familiar with sudden disruptions in data centers due to poor performance of queries that have performed perfectly well in the past. The\ngoal of the seminar was to discuss the current state-of-the-art, to identify specific research opportunities in order to improve the state-of-affairs in query processing, and to develop new approaches or even solutions for these opportunities, building upon successes of the past Dagstuhl Seminars [1, 2, 3]. The organizers (Renata Borovica-Gajic, Goetz Graefe, Allison Lee, Caetano Sauer, and Pinar T\u00f6z\u00fcn) this time attempted to have a focused subset of topics\nthat the participants discussed and analyzed in more depth. From the proposed topics on algorithm choices, join sequences, learned and lightweight indexes, database utilities, modern storage hardware, and benchmarking for robust query processing, the participants formed three work groups: i) one discussing indexing for data warehousing, ii) one discussing robust query operators, and iii) one discussing robust storage architectures. Upon choosing the topics of interest, the organizers then guided the participants to approach the topic through a set of steps: by first considering related work in the area; then introducing metrics and tests that will be used for testing the validity and robustness of the solution; after metrics, the focus was on proposing specific mechanisms for the proposed approaches; and finally the last step focused on the implementation policies. At the end of the week, each group presented their progress with the hope to continue their work towards a research publication.\nThe reports of work groups are presented next.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Renata Borovica-Gajic, Stratos Idreos, Anastasia Ailamaki, Marcin Zukowski, and Campbell Fraser.

            "title": "Representing and Solving Spatial Problems",
            "data": "\n <p>\n<b>Preamble:</b>The idea of organising a Dagstuhl seminar on representing and solving spatial problems started with a discussion between Paulo Santos and the late Christian Freksa over a pair of Erdingers during a previous Dagstuhl Seminar in 2015. In this discussion we tried to solve, once and for all, the underlying reasoning strategies for spatial problem solving, whether it is logical-formal-symbolic, or it is totally/partially grounded on the real world (on what Christian called \u201cthe spatial substrates\u201d). Considering the contributions in this volume, we believe the answer lies in the spectrum of approaches and that the right choice is dictated by the application domain. Indeed, one of the concrete contributions of this meeting was a discussion of possible problem scenarios that should constitute a Spatio-temporal Problem Repository to guide the future development of this field.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Summary of the contributions:</b> Spatio-temporal reasoning is a fundamental aspect of\nproblem solving in general, and it occupies an ubiquitous place in AI and robotics, in the\nsense that almost all problem domains contain a spatio-temporal component. Paradoxically,\ndespite its importance, the combination of spatial and temporal reasoning is one of the AI\nsubfields with a wider gap between the current scientific progress and the human commonsense\nperformance.\n</p> \n <p>This seminar received contributions from researchers working in the various disciplines\ninvolved in investigating the problem of representing and reasoning about spatial problems\n(both in humans and artificial systems). The discussions were initially motivated by the\nfollowing four main topics that are used below to organise the contributions in this collection:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Representation.</b>\n</li><li><b>Formalisation.</b>\n</li><li><b>Description.</b>\n</li><li><b>Problem solving.</b>\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Representation</h3> \n <p>\nThe discussions around the topic Representation were motivated by the following questions: How do humans conceptualise and mentally represent spatial problems? What is the role of high-level spatio-temporal structures for perceiving spatial problems, for manipulating spatial configurations, and for commonsense spatial problem solving?\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this volume, Cohn (Section 3.3) lists seven important problems that could be obstructing the development of automated commonsense spatial reasoning, including the lack of a proper definition of commonsense reasoning, the need for a foundational ontology of space, the problem of how to tackle vagueness and implicit knowledge and the need for suitable default reasoning mechanisms for dealing with spatial information. The acquisition of commonsense\nknowledge and the role of embodiment in perception and spatial awareness were also pointed out as key open research questions. Complementarily, Kuhn (Section 3.9) advocates for the following three conceptualisations for spatio-temporal phenomena: (i) space-time varying fields of attributes, (ii) objects and object collections, (iii) events over fields and objects. W\u00f6rg\u00f6tter (Section 3.22) goes one step up in the abstraction level suggesting the investigation\nof the very idea of concepts and how stimulus-driven experience drives the formation abstract thought. Starting from a distinct standpoint, Sioutis\u2019 arguments (Section 3.17) go in a similar direction with the proposal of a generic neurosymbolic framework for integrating qualitative spation-temporal reasoning with neural models from a probabilistic perspective. The idea\nfor a \u201c(symbolic) spatio-temporal knowledge base, naturally grounded on physics and human cognition\u201d could be a good starting point for testing representation frameworks. Langley (Section 3.10) describes a cognitive architecture for embodied agents, whose recent extensions (towards more flexible representation of space and processes) could provide a fertile ground for the development of research into the core problems in the representation and reasoning\nabout commonsense spatial information.\n</p> \n <h3>Formalisation</h3> \n <p>This topic was motivated by the investigation of what would be a suitable formalism for\ncommonsense problem solving that allows an accurate, flexible and readable knowledge\nrepresentation for spatio-temporal effects of actions performed by an intelligent agent.\n</p> \n <p>\nMuch work in spatio-temporal reasoning has focused on Qualitative Spatial Reasoning\n(QSR) [11], a field that attempts the formalisation of spatial knowledge based on primitive\nrelations defined over elementary spatial entities. Although the combination of (qualitative)\ntemporal and spatial reasoning is not infrequent in the literature in general (see for instance\n[1]), QSR approaches have traditionally overlooked a formal treatment of actions. Aiming to\nbridge the gap between commonsense reasoning, reasoning about actions and change and\nqualitative spatial representation and reasoning, some recent research has focused on spatial\npuzzles and games [2, 12, 3], as these domains offer a small number of objects requiring a\nminimum background knowledge about unrelated features, while they keep enough complexity\nto constitute a challenging problem of KR. This is in line with Cabalar\u2019s contribution in this\nvolume (Section 3.2), where the challenging problem of evidence analysis of digital forensics is\nproposed as a challenging domain for the application of spatio-temporal reasoning strategies.\nCalabar also suggests a set of minimum requirements for a KRR formalism about common\nsense, which includes simplicity, natural understanding, clear semantics, computability and\nelaboration tolerance, where logical formalisms allowing non-monotonic reasoning is pointed\nas the best candidate to fulfil these requirements.\n</p> \n <p>One of the most modern computational tools for non-monotonic reasoning is Answer\nSet Programming (ASP). Lud\u00e4scher (Section 3.12) describes two technical challenges in\nthe ASP encoding of QSR reasoning systems, namely the difficulty in distinguishing spatial\nconfigurations using the natural ASP encoding of pairwise relations; and the exploration of\nthe hierarchical structure of various QSR formalisms. While Lud\u00e4scher describes the latter\nissue from an implementation perspective, Stell (Section 3.18) suggests a research program to\ninvestigate the interaction with hierarchical models of discrete space and time representing\nchanges at different levels of detail. The key idea here is to combine granular change with\ntemporal change for supporting reasoning about effects of actions at different levels of detail.\n</p> \n <p>\nFrom a more foundational standpoint, Borgo (Section 3.1) argues for the creation of a\nsystematic program for the formal study of spatial notions, such as between, convex, simplex,\nparallel etc. This program should include the comparison of distinct perspectives for such\nmodelling, facilitating the understanding of cognitive representation and reasoning. The\nnotion of path is given as an example of how this systematic program could be developed.\n</p> \n <p>\nPease (Section 3.14) proposes the formalisation of everyday concepts and facts in a\nhigh-level classical logic engine called Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). This\nformalisation would constitute a collection of real-world spatio-temporal problems that could\nbe used to test the sufficiency of spatial knowledge representation strategies.\n</p> \n <h3>Description</h3> \n <p>This topic deals with the development of human readable descriptions of the inputs, reasoning\nsteps and solutions of spatial problems. In particular, it addresses whether (and to what\nextent) it would be possible to develop high-level representations or interfaces for dealing\nwith natural language and/or diagrammatic descriptions that allow specifying both the input\nknowledge and the output conclusions in terms of textual descriptions of spatial problems.\n</p> \n <p>Research on spatio-temporal language highlights the range of meanings across contexts\n[13] as well as patterns of usage in relation to mental representations [14] and problem-solving\n[15] in various domains. Part of the insight gained in this research concerns the significance of\nwhat can (or will normally) not be represented in language. Often, non-verbalised concepts\nare those that are best understood through features of the spatial world itself. For instance,\nwe may verbalise only the high-level goal of an everyday action (such as dress up), because\nevery detailed action is represented through a combination of world knowledge with the\naffordances of the actual objects in question. There is no need to learn or conceptualise how\nto handle every possible instance of these objects, because the affordances of each exemplar\nare sufficiently clear to act upon as required. Some of these issues feature in the contributions\nof Dobnik (Section 3.4), Lopes (Section 3.11), Scheider (Section 3.16), Stock (Section 3.19)\nand Tenbrink (Section 3.20).\n</p> \n <p>The following three semantic representational dimensions are listed by Dobnik (Section\n3.4), as a summary of the core aspects of spatial descriptions studied in areas of linguistics,\npsychology, and computer science: (i) scene geometry, (ii) world knowledge and (iii) dynamic\naspects of interaction. Dobnik\u2019s contribution also points out to a few open problems in this\nfield, such as the lack of a unified computational language model that includes all of the cited\ndimensions, the limitation in the current research of grounding language in perception, that\nmostly deals with geometric perceptual context, and the need for experimental evaluation of\nmodels in real open domains.\n</p> \n <p>Lopes (Section 3.11) suggests the use of the differences and interrelations between\nmaps and navigation instructions to instantiate three cognitive core strategies of problem\nsolving (attributed independently to McCarthy and Sloman), which are solving problems by\nfollowing instructions, by descriptive knowledge representation and by analogical reasoning.\nComplementary, Stock (Section 3.19) argues that the current modelling of relative location\ndescriptions is too restricted, not taking into account important contextual factors such as\nphysical environment and objects in it; the observer\u2019s goals and expectations; the audience\nlocation and knowledge. Two main research advances were then proposed to push the\nboundaries of this field: (i) the incorporation of factors proved to be important in linguistic\nand cognitive science research and (ii) cognitive science investigation on some neglected factors that could be used in computational models, such as the influence of users\u2019 goals in\nthe use of spatial relation terms. Tenbrink (Section 3.20) discusses the gap between human\ndescriptions of routes and the state-of-the-art in the automatic generation of such descriptions\nto motivate three main challenges that deserve further attention: the combination of visual\nand verbal information, the consideration of change over time, and the flexibility in the use of\nvarious reference systems. Scheider (Section 3.16) contributes to this discussion suggesting the\nstudy of transformation models for concepts that are constitutive of spatial information, such\nas the concept of location, field, object, event and network. Arguing that transformations\nlie at the core of spatial reference systems, the author suggests that transformation models\ncould be used to handle the variability of spatial information conceptualisations.\n</p> \n <h3>Problem solving</h3> \n <p>The discussion about problem solving was initially motivated by questions about whether\nor not it would be possible (and desirable) to develop interfaces for dealing with spatial\nconfigurations including diagrammatic depictions and natural language descriptions to solve\nspatial puzzles in similar ways as humans do; and also, what are the commonsense problem\nsolving capabilities involving spatio-temporal features including temporal explanation and\nplanning under physical/geometric qualitative or semi-quantitative constraints. This issue\nalso includes the investigation of appropriate problem solving algorithms and their potential\napplications to real-world domains that could be of interest to industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nCalculi for qualitative temporal and spatial reasoning have a long history [4, 5]. More\nrecently the relation between 2D and 3D structures of space (plus time) and their 1D formal\ndescriptions have been investigated; the goal is a farther reaching exploitation of spatial\nstructure for spatial problem solving. Cognitive architectures for robotic agents that make\ndirect use of knowledge and spatial affordances in physical environments (\u2018knowledge in\nthe world\u2019) are currently being developed [10]. The knowledge in the mind of these agents\ncontrols their perception and action in ways that simplifies spatial configurations in order to\nreduce the difficulty of solving the spatial problem at hand, while knowledge about spatial\nrelations is represented directly in perceivable and manipulable physical structures [9]. A\nprinciple underlying this approach is the use of mild abstraction [7] as employed in map\nnavigation or in constructive geometry [8]. Much QSR and related reasoning research was\noriginally motivated by the obvious discrepancy between logic-based metric computation\n(where spatial directions may be defined, for instance, by exact geometric angles and location\nspecifications) and human concepts (such as \u201cto the left\u201d). Falomir\u2019s contribution (Section\n3.5) starts from a discussion of the need to use cognitive heuristics for problem solving\ndirectly acting in the physical world, and argues for an effective combination of machine\nlearning with automated reasoning for spatial problem solving. Spatial reasoning problems\nbased on Perceptual/Differential Ability tests (PAT/DAT) are suggested as test domain\nfor this development. Instead of assuming PAT/DAT as test domain, but still advocating\nthe investigation of cognitive heuristics, Kroll (Section 3.8) describes recent results on the\nuse of gaze heuristics for guiding an autonomous agent, and suggests the use of these ideas\nto dexterous assembly tasks; whereas Zachmann (Section 3.23) describes several issues\npertaining the development of 3D geometric simulation methods for discovering affordances.\n</p> \n <p>Hazarika (Section 3.6) discusses the use of mental maps defined over the space-time\ninformation structures underlying spatial problems (the Spatial Substrate [6]) for understanding\nhow objects and their affordances affect the way humans reason about space. Following\na similar line, Nath (Section 3.13) suggests the use of diagrammatic representations and\nreasoning to express the spatial problems and their physical substrate.\n</p> \n <p>\nMore explicit representation tools for problem solving were described by Homem (Section\n3.7) and Santos (Section 3.15), in which they propose extending their previous work on\napplying case-based reasoning combined with QSR techniques towards complex real-world\nproblems, such as real-time strategy games (Section 3.7) and collaborative mission planning\nfor autonomous maritime vehicles (Section 3.15). Similarly, Wolter (Section 3.21) advocates\nthe investigation of spatial problem solving techniques in dynamic domains (e.g. physical\nmanipulation games) that allow for the progressive development of systems towards humanlevel\ncapabilities.</p> \n <h3>Spatio-temporal Problem Repository</h3> \n <p>An issue that was of common agreement between the participants of the seminar is the need\nto create a Spatial Reasoning Problem repository.

Firstly, it offered a forum for presenting recent scheduling results of high impact and new techniques which may be useful for solving important and long-standing open problems. The second major objective was to debate and explore future research directions, discuss important open problems, and foster new collaborations with a particular attention to\ninteractions with application areas, both in academia and industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organization of the meeting differed from the previous Dagstuhl \"Scheduling\" seminars by not inviting a different community to interact. Despite (or perhaps because of) the success of the cross-discipline events, there was an explicit desire to dedicate a seminar explicitly to recent advances and new research trends within the algorithmics/math programming scheduling community. This setting allowed for very high technical level talks and deep discussions on recent scheduling results, new techniques, and discussions on important open\nproblems. The program included 15 invited main talks, 10 short spot-light talks, open problem sessions in the beginning of the week, and ample unstructured time for research and interaction. The overall atmosphere among the 45 participants was very interactive and oriented towards solving problems (also initiated by the few well-chosen application-driven talks) within new collaborations.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nikhil Bansal, Nicole Megow, and Clifford Stein\n                </div> \n",

At the same time, cryptography does not yet provide satisfying solutions to all practical scenarios and threats. To accomplish appropriate protection of the data, cryptography needs to address several challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nCryptography has always been a prominent theme within the Dagstuhl Seminar series, with the first meeting about cryptography held in 1993, and subsequent seminars on this topic about every 5 years. In 2007 and 2012 a seminar for the subarea of \"Symmetric Cryptography\" has been added, inciting us to coin the seminar here \"Public-Key Cryptography\" for sake of distinction. The public-key branch has been held for the second time, after the first event in 2011.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together 27 scientists in the area of public-key cryptography, including three student researchers who were invited by Dagstuhl to pick a seminar to participate in. The participants came from all over the world, including countries like the US, Great Britain, Israel, France, or Japan. Among the affiliations, Germany lead the number with 9 participants, followed by the US and France with 6 each. \nThe program contained 21 talks, each of 25 to 60 minutes, and a panel discussion about the uneasiness with the current state of our reviewing system, with a free afternoon on Wednesday for social activities and the afternoon on Thursday for collaborations. Before the seminar, we asked the participants to present very recent and ongoing work which, ideally, should not have been published or accepted to publication yet. Most of the participants followed our suggestion and to a large extend the presentations covered topics which have not even been submitted at the time. \n</p> \n <p>The topics of the talks represented the diversity of public-key cryptography. The goal of the seminar was to bring together three challenge areas in cryptography, namely, cryptanalysis and foundations (investigating and evaluating new primitives), optimization (making solutions more efficient), and deployment (designing real-world protocols). As envisioned, the seminar thus has a good mixture of talks from these areas. There were also suggestions to try to co-locate future events of the seminar with other security-related events at Dagstuhl to foster even broader interdisciplinary research. Discussions during and after the talks were lively. It seems as if the goal of stimulating collaborations among these areas has been met. The discussion about the reviewing system has led to some hands-on practices which could be deployed to improve the quality of reviews. This includes incentives such as``Best Reviewer Awards'' and teaching students about proper reviewing.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marc Fischlin\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Information-centric Networking and Security",
            "data": "\n <p>\nDagstuhl seminar 16251 \"Information-centric Networking and Security\" was a short workshop held June 19--21, 2016. The goal was to bring together researchers with different areas of expertise relevant to ICN to discuss security and privacy issues particular to ICN-based architectures. These problems have become increasingly important as ICN technology gradually matures and nears real-world deployment.\n\nThreat models are distinct from IP. Differentiating factors between the two include new application design patterns, trust models and management, as well as a strong emphasis on object-based, instead of channel-based, security. Therefore, it is both timely and important to explore ICN security and privacy issues as well as devise and assess possible mitigation techniques. This was the general purpose of the Dagstuhl seminar. To that end, the attendees focused on the following issues:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>What are the relevant threat models with which ICN must be concerned? How are they different from those in IP-based networks?\n</li><li> To what extent is trust management a solved problem in ICN? Have we adequately identified the core elements of a trust model, e.g., with NDN trust schemas?\n</li><li> How practical and realistic is object-based security when framed in the context of accepted privacy measures used in IP-based networks?\n</li><li> Are there new types of cryptographic schemes or primitives ICN architectures should be using or following that will enable (a) more efficient or secure packet processing or (b) an improved security architecture?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar answered (entirely or partially) some of these questions and fueled discussions for others. To begin, all participants briefly introduced themselves. This was followed by several talks on various topics, ranging from trust management and identity to privacy and anonymity. Subsequently, the attendees split into working groups to focus more intensely on specific topics. Working group topics included routing on encrypted names, ICN and IoT, non-privacy-centric aspects of ICN security, as well as trust and identity in ICN.\nOnce the working group sessions were over, a representative from each presented outcomes to all attendees. (These are documented in the remainder of this report.) The major takeaways from the seminar were as follows.\n</p> \n <p>First, the ICN community still does not have a clear answer for how to handle namespace and identity management. While trust management in ICN can be distributed and function without a global PKI, it seems difficult to break away from this model for namespace management and arbitration. This has strong implications on how names are propagated in the routing fabric. Can any producer application advertise any name, anywhere in the network? If not, how can name prefix advertisements be constrained or limited?\n</p> \n <p>\nSecond, given that ICN focuses on object security, the need for and use of transport protocols that provide forward secrecy should be deferred to higher layers. Attendees found that while most ICN-based architectures do not preclude forward secrecy, it should not be a requirement at the network layer.\n</p> \n <p>\nThird, there is still deep uncertainty about whether ICN should embrace a content locator and identifier split. Names in architectures such as NDN and CCN serve as both a locator and identifier of data, though there are extensions that permit explicit locators (e.g., through the use of NDN LINK objects). This distinction is necessary under the common understanding that routing should concern itself with topological names. Finding data through non-topological names should not be in the data plane as part of the global routing space. However, if we revert to a distinction between topological locators and identifiers, then features unique to ICN become much more limited. One facet that is certainly unique to ICN is how software is written. Specifically, we have the opportunity to move beyond the mental model of a fixed address space and re-design existing network stacks and APIs.\n</p> \n <p>\nFourth, privacy seems difficult to achieve without major architectural changes to ICN-based systems. In particular, since data names reveal a great deal of information to the passive eavesdropper, privacy demands that names and payloads have no correlation. However, achieving this seems infeasible without the presence of an upper-layer service akin to one that would resolve non-topological identifiers to topological names.\n</p> \n <p>\nLastly, there are no compelling reasons to apply esoteric (and often untested) cryptographic techniques in ICN, at least at the network layer. Computationally bounded and \"boring\" cryptographic primitives, such as digital signatures, hash functions, etc., should be the extent of per-packet cryptographic processing done by routers. Anything more would become fodder for Denial-of-Service attacks that could render the entire infrastructure ineffective. However, architecture designs should not restrict themselves to specific algorithms. In other words, there must be flexibility in accommodating multiple (and evolving) cryptographic primitives. This could be useful if, for example, post-quantum digital signature schemes become necessary for the longevity of content authenticators.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe thank Schloss Dagstuhl for providing a stimulating setting for this seminar. Much progress was made over the course of the seminar and since its completion. This is mainly because of the ease of face-to-face collaboration and interaction at Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Christopher A.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar brought together researchers and practitioners from the data management and systems/storage communities to discuss the implications of the modern hardware landscape on high-performance systems. Due to the pandemic, the seminar was organized as a hybrid event: Virtual participation was limited to one session per day that featured invited talks. The in-person component consisted of free-flowing plenary discussions and several smaller,\nfocused working groups. Some key takeaways from the discussion are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>OS/DBMS co-design</b>: Traditional POSIX-style OS abstractions do not work well for data-intensive systems, leading to complex workarounds and suboptimal performance. While some of these issues could in principle be fixed by optimizing OS implementations, others require new APIs. For example, it is very difficult to implement crash-consistent data structures on top of the mmap system call.\n\nC</li><li><b>loud</b>: The cloud is taking over and cloud-native data processing systems often have a a very different architecture from traditional data management systems. For example, many systems strive to separate storage from compute. This trend is enabled by ever faster networks.\n\n</li><li><b>Near-data processing</b>: Separating storage from compute leads to costly data movement, which may be mitigated by pushing down (parts of) the computation close to the data. Major public cloud vendors already to optimize their internal services towards this goal. The challenges is how to program such distributed and specialized hardware components.\n\n</li><li><b>Persistent Memory</b>: One major question discussed at the seminar was the role of byte-addressable persistent memory in future systems and whether what the \"kill app\" for this technology is. While there are several promising applications (e.g., graph processing or systems that require fast recovery times), it is not clear whether wide adoption will occur. Currently, the technology is quite expensive (prices per byte are similar to DRAM) and very hard to program in a crash-consistent way (e.g., writes must be carefully ordered similar to lock-free-style programming).\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Viktor Leis\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h4>Motivation and Purpose of the Seminar</h4> \n <p>\nManufacturing cells and factories, transportation systems and various other parts of critical infrastructure such as energy grids have traditionally been controlled via self-contained, centralized systems continuously monitored and reconfigured by humans.\nThe ever-growing complexity and integration of these Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) into reconfigurable value chains (``Industrie 4.0''), autonomous cars and other services with high reliability requirements necessitates a radical change in the control strategy: Classic controllers will not be able to handle the massive amounts of data generated by these emerging systems, not only because of restrictions with regard to computational power and complexities that might bar human interventions in the processes, but also due to missing or inadequate methods for the control and the interconnection of the devices comprising such systems.\nWhilst CPS have moderate bandwidth/throughput requirements, often in the range of a few bytes per control or sensor message, they require high delivery success rates and predictable latency bounds for these messages and the computations performed on the data, often in the order of a few milliseconds.\nStable controllers can only be developed if a predictable behavior of the communication and computation infrastructure may be assumed.\nOtherwise, the systems may not reach the desired states or even become unstable, up to the point where they may cause physical injuries or the loss of human life.\nHence, a paradigm shift towards real-time oriented communication and computation in CPSs is necessary.\n</p> \n <p>\nSuch a shift can, however, only be achieved by overcoming the traditionally loose coupling in the design of system components in networks.\nCurrently, both the communication systems community and the control systems community consider the components of the respective other field as a ``black box'' and abstract from the variations.\nValuable insights that the other domain might provide towards the joint goal of keeping a CPS controllable may hence not be available.\nAlthough solutions have already been developed that bring communication and control closer together for specific use-cases, the abstraction problem has not been approached from a general, overarching perspective.\n</p> <p>\nThe purpose of this seminar was hence to bring together experts working in the key communities relevant for the science of CPSs and Cyber-Physical Networking (CPN) to get a clearer and more detailed picture of the most important issues of the control and networking aspects that CPSs/CPNs bear and to identify the mutual relations and influences of the associated fields, in order to overcome the so-far strict abstractions and boundaries that exist, and to sketch a roadmap for further research in the field.\nThe driving question was how it is possible to derive generalizable co-design methods and metrics that support the development of universal networked CPSs/CPNs.\n</p> \n <p>\nPrior Dagstuhl Seminars have already addressed CPS aspects such as synthesis (Seminar 17201) and verification methods (Seminar 14122), robustness (Seminar 16362), as well as software engineering for control (Seminar 14382), yet none of these have focused on the interaction, interdependencies and the co-design of communication and control.\n</p> \n <h4>Participants and Structure</h4> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together a total of 30 participants from various fields within the communication and control domains, ranging from promising young scientists to leading authorities within their respective fields, but also including practitioners from industry with a strong research background, as well as representatives from funding organizations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe first day of the seminar was dedicated to an in-depth introductory session. Besides as short personal introduction with background and current research interests, <b>each participant was asked to prepare a personal statement answering the following questions:</b>\n</p> <ul>\n<li> What are the most important problems to solve in the realm of CPS/CPN?\n</li><li> What are the main scientific challenges and which fields can contribute to them?\n</li><li> What have we achieved so far, and what are the pitfalls of past and current research?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nEach personal statement was followed by a discussion round on the presented individual statements.\nThe statements and discussions proved highly fruitful, as they allowed the organizers and the participants to gain an understanding of the current state and future challenges in the Control of Networked CPS from the different disciplinary perspectives.\n</p> \n <p>\nMost often, opinions revolved around the need to understand more about the implications of the dynamic behavior of both the controlled systems themselves and of the communication networks.\nResearch so far seems to have primarily focused on the \"steady state\", as participant termed it.\nThe uncertainties introduced by controlled systems and (especially wireless) networks in coexistence with other systems, however, seem to call for various improvements in CPS/CPN design. Yet, as other participants expressed it, besides having fostered a better understanding of the basics of the respective other fields in recent years by programs such as DFG's Priority Programme 1914 <em>Cyber-Physical Networkin</em>, \"little\" has been achieved be community so far, with a major pitfall being \"lopsided\" methods which are often attributed to \"sticking to domain-specific models\".\nOpening these models to incorporate knowledge from other domains, therefore, seems to be a major challenge for the upcoming time.\n</p> \n <p>\nA further major topic discussed was the need for more realistic and relevant problem settings in the research efforts, since, as one participant put it, \"real problems are more complex than a single inverted pendulum\".\nHence, to avoid \"esoteric\" research and thus \"ending up as an academic field with zero practical impact\", CPS/CPN is in the need of \"prov[ing] that what we develop is useful/needed\" within the upcoming years.\nThis does not mean that basic research has or needs to be concluded in any way.\nYet, further opinions voiced more than once regarded energy efficiency and usable abstraction/decomposition methods (which may at times even sacrifice optimality for applicability and efficiency) as interesting research challenges for the upcoming years, which shows that the community has already begun tackling more practical issues recently.\nA variety of additional comments showed that few, if any, of the issues of CPS/CPN can be considered as solved by today.\n</p> \n <h4>Plenary Discussion: Properties of Cyber-Physical Networks</h4> \n <p>\nThe unexpected intensity of the discussions following the respective personal introductions revealed the extreme variety of opinions on the nature of CPS/CPN and the major challenges in this interdisciplinary field. To facilitate a common understanding, the personal introductions were thus followed by a plenary discussion on which properties define CPS/CPN and make them interesting for scientific study.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt was agreed that - besides the eponymous intertwining of control, networking and the physically tangible world - CPS/CPN are dominated by <em>uncertainties</em> of both the systems and their operational environments, <em>dynamics</em> of configuration and load, (usually) <em>limitations</em> e.g., with respect to the capacity of the network, computation power and energy, a <em>control objective</em> that is sought to achieve through the network (if it is not serving pure monitoring purposes), as well as the associated relative administrative and technical <em>autonomy</em> of CPN compared to their traditional counterparts. Regarding typical metrics of timing and scale, it was further agreed that <b>traditional complexity metrics do not apply to CPN</b>. There often exist intricate and counterintuitive relationships between timing constraints of control and the network, leading to situations in which certain upper- and lower(!)-bounded delays may even be beneficial for the simplification and stabilization of control. Hence, defining the time-criticality of a system is scenario-dependent. Likewise, scaling effects may lead to situations in which too many local observations may prove counterproductive to controllability so that, depending on the scenario at hand, issues arise regarding the \"right\" amount of information sharing between local and global players in distributed decision-making processes. As such, <b>conceiving widely-applicable categories for the complexity of CPS/CPN was identified as an open problem</b>.\n</p> \n <h4>Impulse Talks &amp; Plenary Discussions</h4> \n <p>For the remaining one and a half days of the seminar, the participants were asked to propose impulse talks on topics related to their respective areas of control of CPS/CPN research. Each talk served as the basis for a subsequent plenary discussion aimed at identifying worthwhile research directions for the community. \textbf{Out of a total of 18 proposed impulse talks, six talks were selected by the organizers.} In the following, we present the major insights from the talks and the discussions.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The development of next-generation wireless communication technologies such as 5G and the increased efficiency of small-scale mobile devices in general, have fueled the interconnection of ever more devices into large-scale CPS. However, as the number of devices generating data and potentially taking action increase, so do the burdens on controllers and the network. In his talk, Carlos Canudas-de-Wit showed first results pointing at the fact that both state estimation and control may provide sufficient results even when only considering a well-chosen aggregating subset of a system's sensing and actuating nodes, as long as the distribution of these nodes follows a specific structure, which can, however, be found for many real-world scenarios. Together with another technique based on partial differential equations, the results of his work showed that when combining both control- and information-/network theoretic models, as well as upcoming techniques such as in-network computation that may provide the necessary aggregation infrastructure, even systems of immense complexity can be controlled without overloading controllers and networks.\n\n</li><li> Another challenge of CPS arises when safety guarantees need to be fulfilled, especially when a failure to meet these guarantees can lead to injury or endangerment of human life. Adam Molin presented an industry perspective on the validation and verification of (increasingly) autonomous vehicles, a field in which scenario-based testing approaches represent the state-of-the-art. While the determinism of systems without humans in the loop may aid in the construction of such scenarios, only probabilistic guarantees can be given when humans are involved in the operation of a system. This fact reflects not just on automotives but on multiple other scenarios discussed in the seminar and highlights the importance of joint analysis methods for the control and the communication components of such systems.\n\n</li><li> In her talk on 5G Service Automation, Chrysa Papagianni expressed the view that upcoming mobile networks will witness a shift from open-loop to hierarchical closed-loop control as customers shift towards a pay-per-use scheme for the offered services. Whether the control problems (e.g., regarding network slicing) can be considered to exhibit sub-minute or even real-time requirements (as witnessed in most other systems discussed in the seminar) is still an open question. Yet, considering the anticipated, wide-spread application scenarios of 5G also in the area of CPS/CPN, the seminar identified the issue of base station multi-tenancy as an area for future research within the context of CPN.\n\n</li><li> A cornerstone for the successful operation of CPS/CPN are easily-calculable metrics to assess the operational status, as well as to guide the generation, transmission and evaluation of signals within the systems. Vahid Mamduhi in his talk showed that simple age-of-information (AoI) -- a common metric applied both by the control and the communications communities in theoretical and practical scenarios -- bases on assumptions that can hardly be met by the systems. As a consequence, AoI needs to be augmented by notions of state, timing constraints of the system, and the objective of the control function (all related to a single piece of information) to really provide benefits. Such metrics are arguably hard to conceive for the general case, yet the talk inspired discussions among the participants regarding sensible metrics with broader applicability.\n\n</li><li> From a more communication-oriented perspective, James Gross presented his group's efforts towards determining latency bounds in wireless CPS/CPN. Both a queuing-theoretic and a model checking-based approach (the latter concerning a practical implementation of an ultra-reliable low latency protocol) yielded qualitative results that seem promising. Yet, the practical applicability of such approaches is currently hampered by assumptions regarding distortion that may not hold in practice. In the subsequent discussion, topics included <em>(a)</em>the question whether making the network completely deterministic (or the ability to make determinism assumptions) is actually needed and achievable, and how possible compromises may look like, <em>b)</em> to which degree techniques such as software-defined networking, in-network processing, time slicing and standards such as 5G can contribute towards such goals, and <em>(c)</em> which interfaces, abstractions and design patterns should exist that allow specifying and proving certain guarantees in CPN, especially regarding the interplay of control algorithms and networks.\n</li><li> The complexity and variety of communication protocols within automation is addressed by the recent Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) efforts of the IEEE, which seek to offer a vendor-neutral Ethernet-based solution catering both legacy and future real-time applications, including control. Eventually, the automation pyramid will be transformed into an automation pillar at which TSN serves as the (sole) connectivity provider for control loops which will span the whole automation network from virtualized (/centralized) controllers and the field level. In his talk, Tobias Heer provided an overview of the changes that TSN brings with regard to medium access methods to enable real-time capabilities in Ethernet. While TSN brings significant improvements to wired settings, the subsequent discussion round revolved around the difficulties in achieving this in wireless scenarios. Besides the apparent issues of jamming and/or other attack vectors in wireless control systems, the possibility of trading reliability against capacity and the resulting implications on control algorithms was identified as a research issue.\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Conclusion</h4> \n <p>\nThroughout the presentations and especially the discussions both during the plenary sessions as well as during off-hour activities, the seminar successfully brought together researchers from control and communication from both academia and industry, and undoubtedly fostered a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay of the disciplines in the research area of CPS/CPN.\nA variety of open problems and promising research areas were identified, with some in dire need of increased cooperation between the involved fields.\nThis underlines the need in CPS/CPN research for formats valuing open and honest discussions, and both the organizers and the participants hope to be able to continue these discussions in the following years through additional summits and - once the insights gained in this first edition have shown visible impact on the scientific community - possibly another Dagstuhl Seminar.\nAs a concrete follow-up, the organizers and participant James Gross are planning to conduct a seminar in Stockholm/Sweden in 2020 on this diverse research area.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ren\u00e9 Glebke, John S.

            "data": "\n <p>\nA total of 45 people was invited to this seminar in the first round of invitations. The seminar was fully booked after the first round and 26 researchers from academia and industry participated in the seminar. 21 researchers presented their work in around 15-30 minutes presentations, an abstract of each presentation is included in this report. Besides those presentations participants where presenting their shared data and software in a specific slot. We collected this information in a list of shared resources which we made publicly available (<a href=\"https://github.com/3d-morphable-models/curated-list-of-awesome-3D-Morphable-Model-software-and-data\">https://github.com/3d-morphable-models/curated-list-of-awesome-3D-Morphable-Model-software-and-data</a>). This overview and exchange was one of the aims we had initially in mind when organizing the workshop. In the beginning of the workshop we collected ideas for discussions in our flexible sessions, those ideas are also contained in this report. We then structured the seminar fixing the topics of discussion for the flexible sessions. The summaries of those discussions are also contained in this report. One slot was reserved for a joint group discussion on upcoming ethical concerns on the methods we are developing. This interesting and well organized discussion was an initiative from the participants and not foreseen by the organizers. Another bigger discussion was around the topic of how to compare different approaches and how to establish a benchmark. We did not completely converge on a final solution but we identified currently available benchmarks and we discussed how a gold-standard benchmark would look like. Another aim of the workshop was to initiate an edited book or a survey paper with broad support. Arising from the workshop a group of 13 junior and senior researchers started to work on a joint survey and perspective paper on 20 years of Morphable Face Models.\nDiscussions and presentations were followed by vivid discussions on current challenges and future research directions. To future nurture the ideas of the seminar we started a google group for discussions, sharing news and exchanging students (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/3d-morphable-models\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/3d-morphable-models</a>). The group would like to meet again at Dagstuhl in 2022. The program was more dense than expected and we would like to have more time for discussions in groups after a set of talks.\nWe would like to highlight 5 main discussion points:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>To what degree of detail we need to model in 3D and physically adequate, what can we learn from semi-supervised or unsupervised 2D data?\n</li><li> Is the model depending on the application or is there a golden standard model that is able to fit all applications?\n</li><li> The current revolution of deep learning in computer vision enables a lot of novel strategies and speeds up the models, however, other challenges in modeling, synthesis and inverse rendering remain and new deep learning specific challenges are introduced.\n</li><li> What are the ethical implications of the models and systems we are building?\n</li><li> How will the field develop in the next 20 years? Which challenges should we focus on?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nWe started the seminar with a short introduction of everybody.

            "data": "\n <p>\nPropositional satisfiability (SAT) and Description Logics (DL) are two successful areas of computational logic where automated reasoning plays a fundamental role. Seen from a very abstract level, they can be thought as being part of the same family of logical formalisms attempting to represent knowledge from an application domain, and differentiated only by their expressivity and correspondent trade-off in reasoning complexity. However, the evolution of the two areas has diverged, mainly due to differences in their underlying goals and methods. While the DL community focused on introducing and fully understanding new constructors capable of expressing different facets of knowledge, the SAT community built highly-optimised solvers targeted for industrial-size problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nSome recent work has permeated the boundaries between the two communities. It has been shown that some DL reasoning problems could be reduced to known SAT-related tasks. In turn, these reductions motivated new optimisations targeted to the specific shape of the problems constructed by them. The goal of this seminar was to bring together researchers from both communities to foster a deeper collaboration and mutual development. The primary goals were (i) to understand the tasks and methods from one community which could benefit the other, and (ii) to discuss the policies used within the communities to encourage specific advancements.\n</p> \n <p>\nA relevant issue considered is how to promote the development and testing of DL reasoners. To try to answer this, we discussed the status of benchmarks in both communities, and the success stories from SAT competitions. A salient point was the issue, from the DL point of view, of the many variants that should be evaluated -- from the different languages, to the reasoning tasks considered. However, recent SAT competitions have also successfully handled many categories. One possible explanation for the \nwide availability of solvers capable of handling practical extensions of SAT (like MaxSAT and QBF) is the existence of solvers like \nMiniSAT, which allow for fast prototyping using SAT solvers as oracles.\nNo analogous tool is available for DL reasoners.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe remaining of the seminar focused on novel and timely tasks which are currently under development in both communities, and where the best possibilities for collaborations are foreseen. Among them, we can mention methods for explaining the result from a solver, and proofs which can be used to automatically verify their correctness. We noted that the notion of an <em>explanation</em> is too wide, allowing for different interpretations which were presented as talks during the seminar. Each of these interpretations gives rise to distinct techniques. But interestingly, the core ideas are not necessarily specific to SAT or DLs. This last observation can lead to collaborations studying the problems from both points of view.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to the longer talks whose abstracts accompany this document, other impromptu presentations were triggered by the\nprevious discussions. One clear conclusion which can be taken from these engagements is that the potential for synergic growth\nbetween the areas is large and worth exploring.\n</p> \n <h3>Format</h3> \n <p>\nDue to the COVID-19 situation, the seminar had to be held in a hybrid format. While this had the obvious disadvantage of limiting \nthe social interactions and offline scientific discussions that characterise Dagstuhl seminars, it also allowed the participation of\nmany who, by distance or travel limitations, would have not been able to attend.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the hybrid format meant having a more structured and linear program than originally planned for the\nseminar, but as mentioned already the results are promising.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Joao Marques-Silva, Rafael Penaloza, and Uli Sattler\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nA trajectory is a time-stamped sequence of locations which represents the movement of entities in space. Trajectories are often created by sampling GPS locations and attaching a time-stamp, but they can also \noriginate from RFID tags, video, or radar analysis. Huge data sets exist for entities as diverse as birds, deer, traveling humans, sports players, vehicles, and hurricanes. \n</p> \n <p>\nDuring recent years analysis tools for trajectory data have been developed within the areas of GIScience and algorithms. Analysis objectives include clustering, performing similarity analysis, segmenting a trajectory into characteristic sub-trajectories, finding patterns like flocking, and several others. Since these computations are mostly spatial, algorithmic solutions have been developed in the areas of computational geometry and GIScience. Although trajectories store only the location of a single point of reference on a \nmoving entity, this is acceptable for the common large-scale analysis tasks. However, for the study of more complex phenomena like interaction and collective motion, it is often insufficient and the basic trajectory representation must be extended.\n</p> \n <p>\nSimultaneously, in the area of ecology the study of motion of animals has also become a topic of increasing interest. Many animal species move in groups, with or without a specific leader. The motivation for motion can be foraging, escape from predators, changing climate, or it can be unknown. The mode of movement can be determined by social interactions, energy efficiency, possibility of \ndiscovery of resources, and of course the natural environment. The more fascinating aspects of ecology include interaction between entities and collective motion. These are harder to grasp in a formal manner, \nneeded for modelling and automated analysis.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together a group of enthusiastic researchers with a diverse background. To create a \nshared body of knowledge the seminar featured a number of survey talks that were planned early in the \nweek. The survey talks were rather engaging: the audience learned for instance at what scale one should \nlook at a painting of Van Gogh, how bats chase each other, what size of clumps mussels make and why, \nand how to interact with a computational geometer.\n</p> \n <p>\nProbably the main research result was a momentum started up by interaction and awareness of an exciting direction of research where a lot can still be accomplished.\n</p> \n <p>\nMore specific research accomplishments included a methodology for evaluating whether fish or other animals have their movement mostly influenced by closest neighbors, and how to reconstruct movement just based on counts at different time steps.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Giuseppe F.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe convergence of IT systems, data networks (including but not limited to the Internet) and ubiquitous embedded devices within the cyberphysical system paradigm has led to the emergence of new security threats associated with the system hardware. Manipulating the hardware components that implement security functions can compromise system integrity, provide unauthorized access to protected data, and endanger intellectual property. Additionally, secure hardware is required to protect software in a proper manner tampering. Addressing these vulnerabilities is essential in order to prevent the hardware from becoming the Achilles heel of today's systems. Current technology trends point towards massive utilization of hardware circuits in larger cyberphysical systems that are interacting with the physical environment via sensors and actuators. At the same time cyberphysical systems are more and more integrated via open networks, most notably the Internet. Moreover, they interact with each other, forming systems of systems that exhibit highly complex, emergent behavior and constantly change their boundaries, with new sub-systems continuously entering and leaving. As a consequence, hardware-related threats must be addressed by appropriate countermeasures at realistic costs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar will focus on security threats where hardware components play the main role, and on countermeasures to address these threats. The emphasis is on generic algorithmic advances on the boundary between computer science and other disciplines. While Hardware Security is a very diverse scientific field, the seminar will specifically focus on its three main areas: passive and active side-channel analysis of security-relevant hardware components (cryptographic blocks, true random number generators) which goes beyond classical cryptanalysis; physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and authentication solutions on their basis; and new threats through hardware Trojans and counterfeit ICs as well as techniques for their detection and neutralization.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Osnat Keren and Ilia Polian and Mark M.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe joint processing of language and visual data has recently received a lot of attention. This emerging research field is stimulated by the active development of deep learning algorithms. For instance, deep neural networks (DNNs) offer numerous opportunities to learn mappings between the visual and language media and to learn multimodal representations of content. Furthermore, deep learning recently has become a standard approach for automated image and video captioning and for visual question answering, the former referring to the automated description of images or video with descriptions in natural language sentences, the latter to the automated formulation of an answer in natural language to a question in natural language about an image.\n</p> \n <p>\nApart from aiding image understanding and the indexing and search of image and video data through the natural language descriptions, the field of jointly processing language and visual data builds algorithms for grounded language processing where the meaning of natural language is based on perception and/or actions in the world. Grounded language processing contributes to automated language understanding and machine translation of language. Recently, it has been shown that visual data provide world and common-sense knowledge that is needed in automated language understanding.\n</p> \n <p>\nJoint processing of language and visual data is also interesting from a theoretical point of view for developing theories on the complementarity of such data in human(-machine) communication, for developing suitable algorithms for learning statistical knowledge representations informed by visual and language data, and for inferencing with these representations.\n</p> \n <p>\nGiven the current trend and results of multimodal (language and vision) research, it can be safely assumed that the joint processing of language and visual data will only gain in importance in the future. During the seminar we have discussed theories, methodologies and real-world technologies for joint processing of language and vision, particularly in the following research areas: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Theories of integrated modelling and representation learning of language and vision for computer vision and natural language processing tasks;\n</li><li> Explainability and interpretability of the learned representations;\n</li><li> Fusion and inference based on visual, language and multimodal representations;\n</li><li> Understanding human language and visual content;\n</li><li> Generation of language and visual content;\n</li><li> Relation to human learning;\n</li><li> Datasets and tasks.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe discussions have attempted to give an answer to the following research questions (a non-exhaustive list):\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Which machine learning architectures will be best suited for the above tasks?\n</li><li> How to learn multimodal representations that are relational and structured in nature to allow a structured understanding?\n</li><li> How to generalize to allow recognitions that have few or zero examples in training?\n</li><li> How to learn from limited paired data but exploiting monomodal models trained on visual or language data?\n</li><li> How to explain the neural networks when they are trained for image or language understanding?\n</li><li> How to disentangle the representations: factorization to separate the different factors of variation and discovering of their meaning?\n</li><li> How to learn continuous representations that describe semantics and that integrate world and common-sense knowledge?\n</li><li> How to reason with the continuous representations?\n</li><li> How to translate to another modality?\n</li><li> What would be effective novel evaluation metrics?\n</li></ul> \n <p>This Dagstuhl Seminar has brought together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to discuss the latest scientific realizations and to develop a roadmap and research agenda. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marie-Francine Moens, Lucia Specia, and Tinne Tuytelaars\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Theory of Randomized Optimization Heuristics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nRandomized search and optimization heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing, have become established problem solvers. They have successfully been applied to a wide range of real-world applications, and they are applicable to problems that are non-continuous, multi-modal, and/or noisy as well as to multi-objective and dynamic optimization tasks. Theory of randomized optimization heuristics aims at providing mathematically founded insights into the working principles of these general-purpose problem solvers, and at developing new and more powerful heuristic optimization methods in a principled way. The seminar has covered several important streams in this research discipline. Among several other topics, extended discussions have been held on the advantages of population-based heuristics and of non-static parameter choices, optimization problems with constrains, as well as existing and possible connections to research in machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar continues to be one of the key stimulator for novel ideas,\ntools, and approaches in the theory of randomized optimization\nheuristics. Accordingly, the acceptance rate for the invitations has been staying at a very high level.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>\nThe research in theory of randomized optimization heuristics is as broad as the \napplicability  of  these methods. The seminar succeeded in covering\nthe various theoretical approaches. There was a focus on important cross-cutting topics, which we briefly outline in the following.\n\nOne of the most prominent research areas in the theory of randomized optimization heuristics deals with <em>runtime</em> and <em>convergence analysis</em>, aiming at proving bounds on the speed of the convergence to an optimal solution. Typical questions concern the advantages of certain algorithmic choices, such as\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>the size of the memory (<em>population</em>), \n</li><li> the usage of different sampling strategies (<em>variation</em> of previously sampled search points, in particular via <em>mutation</em> of one previously evaluated solution candidate and <em>recombination</em> of two or more previous search points), and \n</li><li> the selection strategies (e.g., <em>elitist selection</em> which never discards a best-so-far solution vs. the non-elitist Boltzmann strategies found in Simulated Annealing, SSWM, and the Metropolis algorithm).\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nOne of the most relevant objectives in empirical and theoretical\nworks on randomized optimization heuristics is to determine the best parameter\nsettings for the above-described algorithmic components. \nGiven the complex interactions between the parameter values, this <em>parameter tuning</em> task \nis a highly challenging one. It is further complicated by the observation that \nfor most problems the optimal parameter settings change during the optimization process, thus asking for <em>parameter control</em> mechanisms that adjust the parameter value to the current state of the optimization. Identifying such \nreasonable (and possibly provably optimal) ways to update the\nparameter choices has been one of the intensively discussed\ntopics of the seminar. Significant progress towards a better\nunderstanding of different parameter update schemes has been obtained\nin the last few years, as has been demonstrated by several talks, for\nexample on self-adaptive and self-adjusting parameter updates as well\nas on estimation of distribution algorithms. Among other results,\nseveral connections to related questions in machine learning have\nbeen made, motivating the organizers to include machine learning as a\nfocus topic of this seminar. \n</p> \n <p>\nRandomized search heuristics are currently very popular in general\nmachine learning in the form of <em>Bayesian optimization</em>. However,\nthere has been little connection between the research in Bayesian\noptimization and the established work on randomized search\nheuristics, and the seminar was a step to change this. The first talk of the seminar was an extended introduction to Bayesian optimization by Matthew W. Hoffman from Google DeepMind, a leading expert in the field. The talk set the stage for informed discussions on similarities and differences between methods-and potential synergies between the research fields. Thompson sampling,\nan important algorithm in Bayesian optimization, was revisited in the\ntalk by Jonathan Shapiro on dueling bandit problems, which demonstrated randomized search heuristics in a scenario of high commercial relevance.  A common application of randomized search heuristics in general machine learning is model selection, for example finding a tailored structure of a neural network. This was addressed in the talk by Olivier Teytaud from Google Brain, who discussed model selection heuristics for large-scale machine learning\nsystems. Randomized search heuristics are also successfully used for\nreinforcement learning. Arina Buzdalova presented work in which the\nconnection is the other way round: ideas from reinforcement learning are used to improve randomized optimization (by controlling the choice of objectives).\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother intensively discussed topic, highly relevant in both discrete and continuous optimization, was constrained optimization. Here the main research questions concern the different ways to model constrained problems in black-box settings, and suitable algorithmic approaches. In addition to a number of theoretical results on constrained optimization, the need for a well-designed benchmark suite has also been discussed. As a result of one of the breakout sessions of the previous Dagstuhl Seminar 15211 on <em>Theory of Evolutionary Computation</em>, Dimo Brockhoff presented the recent extension of the COCO benchmark set (<a href=\"http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php\">http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php</a>) to constrained optimization. Dirk Arnold presented some work indicating that this extension of COCO is very timely, and much needed in the randomized search heuristics community.\nFurthermore, another breakout session has been held this year on the topic of constrained optimization, organized by Frank Neumann, with a focus on the different ways to model soft and hard constraints in discrete black-box optimization. \n</p> \n <h3>Organization</h3> \n <p>The seminar schedule has offered a good flexibility for the participants to propose talks and discussions of different lengths. 29 talks of 10--30 minutes each have been held in total, in the plenary room. These plenary talks were complemented by a introductory tutorial on Bayesian Optimization by Matt Hoffman on Monday morning and by 7 breakout sessions on various topics, including methodology-oriented discussions on the applicability of drift analysis in continuous domains or how to interpret the CMA-ES in the framework of information geometry optimization as well as problem-driven brainstorming on constrained optimization, the role of diversity in heuristic search, preference-based selection, and the method of estimation of distribution algorithms. Another breakout session was devoted to discussing the importance and possible obstacles of bringing theory-and practice-driven research in heuristic optimization closer together. The breakout sessions have been held on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoon, respectively, and have all witnessed high attendance rates. All talks and breakout sessions are summarized in Sections 3 and 4 of the present report. \n</p> \n <p>We would like to express our gratitude to the Dagstuhl staff and all\nparticipants for making this Dagstuhl Seminar 17191 on <em>Theory of\nRandomized Optimization Heuristics</em> such a successful event, which\nhas been a pleasure to organize. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Carola Doerr, Christian Igel, Lothar Thiele, and Xin Yao\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nMany different kinds of models, from engineering models to scientific models, have to be integrated and coordinated to support sustainability systems such as smart grid or cities, i.e., dynamically adaptable resource management systems that aim to improve the techno-economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Scientific models help understand sustainability concerns and evaluate alternatives, while engineering models support the development of sustainability systems. As the complexity of these systems increases, many challenges are posed to the computing disciplines to make data and model-based analysis results more accessible as well as integrate scientific and engineering models while balancing trade-offs among varied stakeholders. This seminar explored the intrinsic nature of both scientific and engineering models, the underlying differences in their respective foundations, and the challenges related to their integration, evolution, analysis, and simulation including the exploration of what-if scenarios. \n</p> \n <p>\nSustainability systems must provide facilities for the curation and monitoring of data sets and models and enable flexible (open) data and model integration, e.g., physical laws, scientific models, regulations and preferences, possibly coming from different technological foundations, abstractions, scale, technological spaces, and world views. This also includes the continuous, automated acquisition and analysis of new data sets, as well as automated export of data sets, scenarios, and decisions. The main function is to support the generation of what-if scenarios to project the effects on the different sustainability dimensions, and support the evaluation of externalities, especially for non rapidly renewable resources. Since the predictions are necessarily probabilistic, the system must be able to assess the uncertainty inherent in all its actions and provide suitable representations of uncertainty understandable by users. In addition to generating what-if scenarios to explore alternate model instantiations, the tool should be capable of generating suggestions for how to reach user-specified goals including quantifiable impacts and driving the dynamic adaptation of sustainability systems. These powerful services must be made accessible to the population at large, regardless of their individual situation, social status, and level of education.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar explored how Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) will help to develop such an approach, and in particular i) how modeling frameworks would support the integration of the various heterogeneous models, including both engineering and scientific models; ii) how domain specific languages (DSLs) would (a) support the required socio-technical coordination, i.e., engage engineers, scientists, decision makers, communities, and the general public; and (b) integrate analysis/probabilistic/user models into the control loop of smart CPS (cyber physical system). DSLs are also supposed to provide the right interface (in terms of abstractions/constructs) to be used as tools for discovering problems and evaluating ideas.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar served to identify critical disciplines and stakeholders to address MDE for sustainability and the research roadmap of the MDE community with regards to the development of sustainability systems. In particular, the seminar identified and explored four key areas: 1) research challenges relevant to modeling for sustainability (M4S); 2) a multidisciplinary collection of relevant literature to provide the foundation for exploring the research challenges; 3) three case studies from different application domains that provide a vehicle for illustrating the M4S challenges and for validating relevant research techniques; and 4) the human and social aspects of M4S. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe cumulative results of the work performed at the seminar and subsequent collaborations will help to establish the required foundations for integrating engineering and scientific models, and to explore the required management facilities for evaluating what-if scenarios and driving adaptive systems. In addition, we envision to produce as an outcome of the seminar a representative case study that will be used by the community to assess and validate contributions in the field of modeling for sustainability.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gordon Blair, Betty H.

            "data": "\n <p>\nReal-time applications are characterized by the need for both\nfunctional correctness and temporal correctness (appropriate timing behaviour).\nReal-time systems are present in many diverse areas such as avionics,\nautomotive, space, robotics, and medical applications to cite only a few.\nMixed Criticality Systems\n(MCS) have become an important topic for the real-time systems\ncommunity. The first cluster of the European collaborative projects on MCS has been completed in September 2016, indicating a maturing of the related concepts within both industry and academia. Nevertheless many of the challenges brought about by the\nintegration of mixed criticality applications onto multicore and\nmanycore architectures remain to be solved. In reality mixed\ncriticality problems have inherited the difficulty of real-time\nsystems: being at the frontier of several domains including real-time\nscheduling, real-time operating systems / runtime environments, and timing\nanalysis, as well as hardware architectures. This seminar promoted\nlively interaction, cross fertilization of ideas, synergies, and\ncloser collaboration across different sub-communities of academics and\nindustrialists from aerospace, automotive, and railway industries with\nspecific interests in MCS, as well as with experts in certification.\n</p> \n <p>In common with the first Dagstuhl Seminar on Mixed Criticality Systems,\n this seminar also focused on the two key conflicting\nrequirements of MCS: separation between criticality levels for\nassurance and sharing for resource efficiency, along with the related\nrequirement of time composability. An important aspect of this\nseminar was the presentation of different industry perspectives on\nthe key problems. These perspectives formed the starting point of our seminar, with the first day mainly dedicated to industry statements on current\npractice and their perception of current work on MCS. The academic\nparticipants benefited from substantial and detailed arguments from\nthe industry speakers. There were lively interactive discussions\nduring the talks which led to much improved understanding of current industry practice, as well as helping to build a common vocabulary between academic and industry participants. The first day concluded with presentations by academic speakers presenting their thoughts on more practical mixed criticality models.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe next three days each included sessions devoted to an invited tutorial from a academic speaker. These covered the one-out-of-m multicore problem, Networks-on-Chip and mixed criticality, resource management, and statistical approaches to worst-case execution time estimation. The remaining sessions covered a range of fascinating open problems. In addition, a number of ad-hoc small working groups formed to collaborate on specific topics. We are pleased to report that a significant number of these initial collaborations have gained traction resulting in further work after the seminar, and in some cases the development and submission of papers.\n</p> \n <p><b>Organization of the seminar report.</b> Section 3 is an overview of the industry talks and Section 4 provides an overview of the academic talks. Section 5 presents working group discussions. Section 6 summarizes open problems discussed during the seminar. Finally outcomes from the seminar are listed in Section 7. As organizers, we would like to thank Prof. Reinhard Wilhelm for joining us, Dagstuhl\u2019s Scientific Directorate for allowing us to run a second seminar on mixed criticality systems, and to the staff at Schloss Dagstuhl for their superb support during the seminar itself. Finally, we would like to thank all of the participants for the very lively and open discussions. As organizers, we appreciated the feedback and enthusiasm which made running\nthe seminar a great pleasure.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Liliana Cucu-Grosjean, Robert Davis, Sanjoy K.

            "title": "Privacy and Security in Smart Energy Grids",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSmart electricity grids augment the electricity distribution network with modern communications and computerized control to improve efficiency, reliability, and security of electricity distribution, and more flexible production. This initiative has been greeted by consumers and utilities not only with enthusiasm but also concern. Consumers worry about their privacy. Utilities worry about the security of their assets.\n</p> \n <p>\nConsumer organizations across the globe protested against smart meters and smart homes collecting all their data, warning that security breaches in the databases of the utilities would expose privacy-critical data to attackers, or open to secondary uses leading to increased insurance premiums, behavioral advertising or privacy invasion. These outcries and reactions have triggered academics and industry to look into designing privacy friendly architectures for smart metering. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar 16032 in particular focused on the two use cases of smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) and distribution automation. The seminar discussed these use cases with respect to the following challenges:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> security architectures,\n</li><li> secure and privacy-friendly communication, and\n</li><li>  hardware and software security for constrained devices in the smart grid. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\n<b>Smart Charging:</b> \nCharging of electric vehicles is the next big challenge for privacy and security researchers: smart charging algorithms try to minimize loads on the grid by collecting various kinds of customer data, making it easy to reserve charging spots and book charge frequencies using smart-phone apps. The main motivation behind smart charging is to save copper for cables to match the load demands, given that an electric vehicle draws as much as a full household. Cables are designed to satisfy the demands at peak times. So profiling customers helps to foresee these demands and to calculate the cost of the needed grid infrastructure. Moreover, the cable designs use prediction algorithms to optimize loads, while assigning low priority to privacy issues, security architectures, and secure communication protocols.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n<b>Distribution Automation:</b> Another problem lies in the task of automated electricity distribution. In a smart grid, safety critical events in transformer stations can be monitored and operated remotely. Adding communication also exposes assets to new vulnerabilities and attacks. Grid components are controlled by dedicated devices that pose a challenge in terms of their storage and computation capacities. Moreover, as with any critical infrastructure, security often conflicts with safety. As a consequence security often does not play any role in the design of communication protocols and devices, supported by the argument that most devices reside in physically protected substations. However, providing such physical security is expensive and hackers do not need physical access to the grid operator sites if they are connected to the utility's IT network.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of this seminar was thus (i) to raise awareness of these critical problems affecting every European citizen now or at least in the foreseeable future, and (ii) to bring together academic researchers as well as utility experts in order to start an open dialogue on smart grid privacy and security problems and potential solutions to support customers and utilities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    George Danezis, Stefan Katzenbeisser, Christiane Peters, and Bart Preneel\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Towards Accountable Systems",
            "data": "\n <h4>Background and Motivation</h4> \n <p>\nTechnology is becoming increasingly pervasive, impacting all aspects of everyday life. Our use of apps and online services is tracked and extensively processed (data analytics), and the results are used for various purposes, predominately advertising. Monitoring and surveillance by sensors in smart cities creates vast amounts of data, much of which can be identifiably linked with people. Smart home, health and lifestyle monitoring, and other sensor technologies yield sensitive personal data; mobile phones reveal people's positions, and their calls are tracked leading to data that can be used to determine social linkages and sometimes mental wellbeing. Such collection and analysis of personal data raises serious privacy concerns. A key aspiration is to provide end-users with a means to understand their digital footprints, and control the propagation, aggregation and retention of their data.\n</p> \n <p>\nConcerns over data movement, location, processing and access have led to increasing regulation, both national and international. An example is the recently adopted EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that reinforces and expands individual rights, as well as restrictions and obligations regarding personal data.  However, data moves easily beyond geographical boundaries, and use of cloud computing resources may mean that stored data may be replicated in multiple locations worldwide, with potential for conflicts between applicable laws and jurisdictions. Governments may demand access to data (whether stored locally or remotely) and this may result in complex legal disputes. Regulations, codes of conduct, and best practices can incentivise the use of particular technical mechanisms for data management. Examples include encryption and anonymisation, for example when using medical data for research. However, there are often misalignments between legalslash regulatory aims and the capabilities of the technologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nKey issues concern how to demonstrate compliance with regulations, such as those regarding how data is handled and used, and, in cases of failure, how to hold the appropriate entities accountable. This is a particular challenge for wide-scale, federated, or cross-border systems.  In large or complex systems, data may be handled by many different parties, falling under various management regimes and jurisdictions. Such concerns are not only horizontal (e.g., data being exchanged between parties, across geographic regions) but also vertical, where different levels of the services stack are managed by different parties (e.g., a company application running over a Heroku PaaS that runs over Amazon IaaS). Most end-users (people!) are oblivious to the potential complexity of such systems, let alone the complexity of the legal requirements that underpin such architectures. In general, the lack of transparency and uncertainty about the means for compliance with legal obligations, along with a lack of technical means for managing such concerns, may inhibit innovative technology development (a \"chilling factor\"), may escalate compliance costs, may trigger inappropriate policy responses, and may work to undermine public trust in technology.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese concerns will only grow in prominence, given the increasing deployment of sensors, generating ever-more data; actuators, giving systems physical effects; and the use of machine learning, facilitating automation.\nIn response,  this seminar brought together experts from the computer science and legal communities, spanning academia and industry, to explore issues of accountability as it relates to data and systems. The seminar aimed to: (i) raise awareness of and establish new research directions concerning issues of accountability as they relate to systems, given directions in systems technologies; (ii) explore developing legal and regulatory requirements; and (iii) investigate issues of user empowerment. A key goal was to increase awareness that law, regulation and requirements for data usage, management, security, confidentiality, quality and provenance should align with the technology, and <em>vice versa</em>: technologists should be legally-aware and lawyers should be technology-aware.\n</p> \n <h4>Seminar Structure</h4> \n <p>\nDue to the diverse backgrounds of the participants, the first day was focused on introductions and ensuring that everyone had a common grounding in key topics. This included a series of guided discussion sessions: Lilian Edwards provided an introduction to legal and regulatory considerations, particularly the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); Jon Crowcroft introduced emerging technical architectures such as edge computing; Bertram Lud\u00e4scher led a session exploring data provenance; and Ben Wagner introduced broader ethical and social concerns. A motivating case study was also presented highlighting how an apparently enthusiastic view of emerging Internet of Things technologies might obscure a plethora of questionable social and policy implications.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe structure of the week included multiple breakout sessions in which working groups examined particular topics (below) and reported back summaries of their discussions at plenary sessions. The working group sessions were interspersed with an interactive case study session, that focused on the technological compliance concerns of a hypothetical global hotel chain seeking to introduce a series of IoT and cloud technologies in the current regulatory environment, and a session in which participants were able to present their recent research, abstracts for (most of) which are included in this report.\n</p> \n <p>\n</p> <h4>Moving forward</h4> \n <p>\nThe topics explored by the working groups at the seminar spanned policy, legal and technical considerations. The topics were seeded by the organisers but were ultimately gathered from the participants through a preference allocation process. The chosen topics included:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<em>\n<li>Trust in systems.\n</li><li>Who is, could or should be accountable in complex systems?\n</li><li>Engineering accountable systems.\n</li><li>Is there a place for data provenance in accountable systems?\n</li><li>Anonymity, identity and accountability.\n</li><li>Thinking beyond consent.\n</li><li>Automating the exercising of rights for collective oversight.\n</li></em>\n</ul> \n <p>\nEach group was asked to produce an abstract summarising the key issues, challenges and ways forward from the discussion. These abstracts are included in this report, and indicate many potential opportunities for research.\n</p> \n <p>\nGenerally, it was felt that <em>this seminar represented only the start of this important discussion</em>. It is clear that there is a substantial and urgent need for closer interactions between the technical and legal domains, such that (i) the computer science communities better understand the legal requirements and constraints that impact the design, implementation and deployment of technology; and (ii) the legal communities gain more of a grounding in the nature, capabilities, and potential of the technology itself. It was also recognised that there is potential for better collaboration amongst different computer science communities; for example, to have greater interactions between those working in systems, provenance and machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn light of this, key to moving forward is to work to form collaborative research proposals, and to organise relevant meetings, in order to drive progress on the topics, challenges and research opportunities identified during this seminar. \nAs issues of accountability increase in importance and urgency, it is vital that researchers across academia, industry and civil society work together to proactively confront these challenges.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    David Eyers, Christopher Millard, Margo Seltzer, and Jatinder Singh\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Coding Theory for Inference, Learning and Optimization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nCodes are widely used in engineering applications to offer reliability and fault tolerance. The high-level idea of coding is to exploit redundancy in order to create robustness against system noise. The theoretical properties of codes have been studied for decades both from a purely mathematical point of view, as well as in various engineering contexts. The latter have resulted in constructions that have been incorporated into our daily lives: No storage device, cell phone transmission, or Wi-Fi connection would be possible without well-constructed codes.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent research has connected concepts in coding theory to non-traditional applications in learning, computation and inference, where codes have been used to design more efficient inference algorithms and build robust, large-scale, distributed computational pipelines. Moreover, ideas derived from Shannon theory and the algebraic properties of random codes have resulted in novel research that sheds light on fundamental phase transition phenomena in several long-standing combinatorial and graph-theoretic problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of our seminar was to accelerate research in the growing field of coding theory for computation and learning, and maximize the transformative role of codes in non-traditional application areas. The seminar brought together 22 researchers from across the world specializing in information theory, machine learning, theoretical computer science, optimization, and statistics. The schedule for each day included a tutorial talk by a senior researcher, followed by shorter talks by participants on recent or ongoing work. The afternoons were devoted to informal breakout sessions for groups to discuss open questions. Two of the larger breakout sessions focused on distributed optimization and group testing.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeminar participants reported that they enjoyed hearing about new ideas, as well as delving into deeper technical discussions about open problems in coding theory. Some topics deserving special mention include the use of techniques in statistical mechanics; locally decodable and recoverable codes; submodular function optimization; hypergraph clustering; private information retrieval; and contagion on graphs. All participants valued the ample time for discussions between and after talks, as it provided a fruitful atmosphere for collaborating on new topics.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Po-Ling Loh, Arya Mazumdar, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, and R\u00fcdiger Urbanke\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nOne lesson learned from the Snowden leaks is that digital systems can never be fully trusted and hence the security awareness of citizens has increased substantially. Whenever digital data is communicated or stored, it is subject to various attacks. One of the few working countermeasures are the use of cryptography. As Edward Snowden puts it: <em>\"Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on.\"</em>\n</p> \n <p>\nConsequently it holds that although modern cryptography addresses a variety of security challenges, efficiently protecting the enormous amount of daily electronic communication represents a  major challenge.  Here, symmetric cryptography is especially highly relevant not only for academia, but also for industrial research and applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough symmetric cryptography has made enormous progress in the last couple of decades, for several reasons regularly new insights and challenges are evolving. In the past, the AES competition was led by US NIST to standardize a next generation block cipher to replace DES. Similar competitions, such as the eSTREAM and the SHA-3 competition, resulted in new standard algorithms that meet public demands. The outcome of the projects are practically used in our daily lives, \nand the fundamental understanding of the cryptographic research community of these primitives has been increased significantly.\n</p> \n <p>While  this seminar concentrates in general on the design and analysis of symmetric cryptographic primitives, special focus has been put on the following two topics that we explain in more detail below:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Authenticated encryption\n</li><li> Even-Mansour designs\n</li></ol> \n <p><b>Authenticated Encryption.</b>\nToday the central research question is the construction of schemes for <em>authenticated</em> encryption. This symmetric primitive efficiently integrates the protection of secrecy and integrity in a single construction.\nThe first wave of solutions resulted in several widely used standards,\nincluding CCM and GCM  standardized by NIST, and the EAX-prime standardized by ANSI. However, it turns out that these constructions are far from optimum\nin terms of performance, security, usability, and functionality.\nFor instance a   stream of data  cannot be protected with CCM, as the length of the entire input has to be known in advance. The security of GCM heavily relies on the existence of data called a nonce, which is supposed to never be repeated. Indeed, the security of GCM is completely lost once the nonce is repeated. While it is easy to state such a mathematical assumption, \nexperience shows that there are many practical cases where realizing this condition is very hard. For instance the nonce may repeat if a crypto device is reset with malice aforethought, or as a consequence of physical attacks on the device. Furthermore, weak keys were identified in GCM, and the security of EAX-prime is questionable. \n</p> \n <p>\nThus there is a strong demand for secure and efficient authenticating encryption scheme. As a consequence, the CAESAR project (Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability, and Robustness) has been initiated. The goal of the project is to identify a portfolio of authenticated encryption schemes that (1) offer advantages over GCM/CCM and (2) are suitable for widespread adoption. The deadline of the submission was March 15, 2014, and the project attracted a total of 56 algorithms from 136 designers from all over the world. There are plenty of innovative designs with attractive features,\nand the final portfolio is planned to be announced at the end of 2017.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar took place in  the middle of the CAESAR competition; it is two years from the submission deadline and we have about two years until the announcement of the final portfolio. Therefore, it was a perfect point in time to sum up the research done so far, to exchange ideas and to discuss future directions.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Even-Mansour Designs.</b>\nAnother strong trend in the current symmetric key cryptography is related to \nthe so-called <em>Even-Mansour designs</em>. This design paradigm was proposed in 1991 and can be seen as the abstraction of the framework adopted in the design of AES. This general design framework iterates r times the xor of a key and a public permutation. The design framework is highly relevant in practice, and it has been adopted in a variety of recent hash functions, block ciphers, and even in the underlying primitive of several CAESAR submissions. Despite its long history of practical use, the community has so far failed to develop a  complete understanding of its security. From a theoretical viewpoint, \nthe original proposal was accompanied with a proof of security,\ndealing with the case of r=1 iteration. \n</p> \n <p>\nOnly 20 years after the initial proposal, in 2012, a bound was proven for the security of r=2 iterations. In 2014, the question was solved to cover the general case of r iterations. However, these results only deal with the simple case of distinguishing attack on a single, unknown key setting.\nIts security in more advanced, yet practically relevant security models, such as the related-key setting or  the chosen/known-key setting, is largely unexplored.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother problem here is that the theoretical analysis assumes that the permutation used therein is ideal and the keys are ideally random,\nwhich is not the case for practical constructions. This implies that the theoretical results do not directly translate into the practical constructions,\nand the security analysis has to be repeated for each constructions.\n</p> \n <p>\nSumming up, Evan-Mansour designs represent a fruitful and challenging area of research, that hopefully will lead to a fundamental understanding of iterated constructions and ultimately to more efficient and more secure ciphers. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Frederik Armknecht, Tetsu Iwata, Kaisa Nyberg, and Bart Preneel\n                </div> \n",

The group of attendees was composed of 28 people with diverse expertise on the various areas of Internet, coming from Europe, US, Asia and Australia. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe group worked for two and a half days, and the work was organised on (i) seed talks, (ii) snippet talks on selected research topics related to IoP, and (iii) parallel group work. The group sessions were particularly productive, and attendees worked on many topics. Specifically, they covered the following topics: (i) IoP definition, (ii) IoP use cases, (iii) IoP and people; (iv) Privacy, security and trust; (v) IoP architecture, and (vi) transition towards IoP. Over the last day, the group again split in three sub-groups, to focus on conclusions and follow-up activities. Specifically, the three groups produced (i) guidelines for IoP toolkits, (ii) a possible IoP research agenda, and (iii) an IoP manifesto.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe managed to bring together a quite balanced group of 32 people with expertise in the design and implementation of wireless ad hoc networks of various types, human-computer interaction, community informatics, urban interaction design, ethnography, media studies, arts and design.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main take-home message from the seminar is that IoP is an emerging research topic with a lot of potential. It spans many aspects, including but not limited to the set of topics identified for the group work. Each of the group works provided concrete guidelines on the selected topics, possibly providing focused research agenda for the future.\n</p> \n <p>\nMost of all, we are very happy that attendees greatly enjoyed the seminar, including those attending for the first time a Dagstuhl event (about one third). We do believe that the seminar laid the grounds for future fruitful collaborations, and helped a lot in shaping the key ideas of the emerging research topic of IoP.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Elizabeth M.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar was planned for 40 participants, but due to travel restrictions resulting from Covid-19, only 15 were able to attend - though several key talks were delivered via teleconferencing.  As a result, the Seminar was very focused, and very productive.  Some aspects were lost, perhaps in particular representation in-person of the full breadth of applications communities.  \n</p> \n <p>\nIt was very evident from the presentations and lively discussions at the Seminar that the field of \"Tensor Computations\" is vibrant, multi-faceted, interdisciplinary, and fundamental to progress in a diverse range of important areas which are driving researchers in different fields to search for common foundations and common tools.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the communities with an interest in tensor computations can be described as \"classical\" computational science, focusing, for example, on partial differential equations in fluid dynamics, and electronic structure computations in chemistry and materials science.  Tensor contractions have been identified as a powerful way of representing the computational structure in the architecture of compilers for domain-specific languages serving these communities.  Exploiting this algebraic intermediate representation in the compiler has enabled important performance optimizations far beyond the scope of conventional compilers based on loop nests and polyhedral techniques.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother major community is primarily concerned with tensor decomposition - finding low-rank approximations of tensors.  This is fundamental to data analytics and machine learning applications. Tensor factorization also provides a powerful framework for deep learning and representation learning, and provides a promising strategy for weight compression in convolutional neural networks.\n</p> \n <p>\nTensor contractions, in the form of tensor networks, have enormous importance as a tool for understanding and computation in particle and quantum physics. Indeed mapping the connections between these topics, as exposed through the structure of the tensor network representation, offers an exciting frontier with the potential to underpin these different disciplines with common language and shared software. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe Seminar developed a focus, to some extent as a result of the participants able to attend, on tensor contractions, recognising that this provides a foundation for implementation of numerical methods for tensor decompositions.  Revisiting this is a key topic to be addressed in following up this Seminar in the future.\n</p> \n <p>  \nA major focus for progress was identified in characterization of safety and correctness properties - ensuring that tensor contraction expressions are well-formed and meaningful.  A related topic that was identified as critical concerns how structure is captured, represented and used.  This is not only conceptually valuable, but provides a pathway to exploiting block, band and symmetry structure in generating efficient code. \n</p> \n <p>\nAn open question remains in how to capture, track and exploit the properties of tensors with unstructured (i.e. data-dependent) sparsity.\n</p> \n <p>\nA key outcome from the Seminar was to recognize the massive replication of efforts in terms of software development.\nMany tools and libraries are being re-developed within different communities, while failing to share techniques and experience in high-performance implementation.  The aim of this Seminar was to address this lack of cohesive, coherent community effort to develop computational building blocks. The results of this effort are being realized in the form of a \"white paper\", offering a manifesto for how to bridge the discipline divides and realize the potential for tensor computations in the future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Paolo Bientinesi, David Ham, Furong Huang, Paul H.

            "data": "\n <p>\nComputing capacity surronds our environment more and more. The\nexploitation of this diffused infrastructure poses a number of\nchallenges. A notable one is the guarantee of predictable performance.\nMany modern computing platforms require high degrees of predictability\nin their timing characteristics -- for instance, in avionics and\nautomotive applications, it is essential that the tasks complete in a\ntimely manner in order to take appropriate actions in response to a\ndeveloping situation.  With increasing complexity and heterogeneity in\nfunctionality required by time-sensitive applications, there is\nan increasing need for designing distributed interconnected platforms\nthat respond to time-varying requests in a highly predictable way.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe world of networking is undergoing an analogous transformation.\nThere is a major shift towards smarter and more autonomous\nnetworks, the so-called self-driving networks.  The goal is to mimic the\nsuccess that cloud-computing techniques and concepts had on the\ntransformation of the IT infrastructure. The latter made it possible to allow\nphysical resources, such as computing and storage nodes, to be shared\namong users through the use virtual resources (Network Function\nVirtualization). Virtualization of network functions offers an efficient way to meet \ndynamic user demands in a cost-effective manner. However,\nthe guarantee of predictability in NFV is, to date, an open problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nWith increasing complexity and heterogeneity in functionality required\nby timing-sensitive applications, there is need for designing\ndistributed and interconnected platforms that provide high \npredictability.  On the one hand, with the advent of Cyber-physical\nsystems and Industry 4.0, real-time systems are becoming more and more\nnetworked systems. On the other hand, networking scenarios where\na-priori quantifiable guarantees on the worst-case traversal time are\nrequired as a prerequisite for a correct application-level computation\nare becoming commonplace. Therefore, it is necessary to develop\nmethods to ensure compliance with end-to-end deadlines in distributed\nsystems where <em>both</em> computation and communication are involved.\n\nDagstuhl seminar \"Analysis, design and control of predictable interconnected systems\" gathered\nmore than 40 researchers from four continents, with a good balance of \nseniority and gender. These researchers came from different communities, including\nNetwork Calculus, Real-time Systems, Control Theory, Performance Evaluation and Data-flow, which\nhave been discussing similar problems in the recent past, sometimes\nalso using similar methodologies, but different notations and hypotheses, and \nfocusing on different characteristics. \nThe aim of the seminar was to foster cross-fertilization and inter-community \nnetworking, using new, contemporary problems which are interesting\nfor and discussed within more than one community. The seminar hosted 26 talks. \nSome of these were \"background-levelling\" talks given by well-recognized senior experts\nin the resepective communities, with the aim of crossing the lexicon and\nnotation gap between communities. Other talks, building on the shared\nbackground provided by the former, discussed interesting novel problems and \npromising application areas. \nThe open, schedule-as-you-go format for the talks and the time left open for \nfree networking activities fostered an open environment. The general conclusion,\nwhich can be gathered by the (mostly enthusiastic) comments in the inal survey, \nis that the involved communities have more in common with each other than the attendees\nthought, and cross-fertilization is necessary to tackle new problems in a \nholistic approach.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Kunal Agrawal, Enrico Bini, and Giovanni Stea\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\n<em>This seminar is dedicated to the memory of our co-organiser and friend David Stifler Johnson, who played a major role in fostering a culture of experimental evaluation in computing and believed in the mission of this seminar. He will be deeply missed.</em>\n</p> <p>\nThe pervasive application of computer programs in our modern society is raising fundamental questions about how software should be evaluated. Many communities in computer science and engineering rely on extensive experimental investigations to validate and gain insights on properties of algorithms, programs, or entire software suites spanning several layers of complex code. However, as a discipline in its infancy, computer science still lags behind other long-standing fields such as natural sciences, which have been relying on the scientific method for centuries.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere are several threats and pitfalls in conducting rigorous experimental studies that are specific to computing disciplines. For example, experiments are often hard to repeat because code has not been released, it relies on stacks of proprietary or legacy software, or the computer architecture on which the original experiments were conducted is outdated. Moreover, the influence of side-effects stemming from hardware architectural features are often much higher than anticipated by the people conducting the experiments. The rise of multi-core architectures and large-scale computing infrastructures, and the ever growing adoption of concurrent and parallel programming models have made reproducibility issues even more critical. Another major problem is that many experimental works are poorly performed, making it difficult to draw any informative conclusions, misdirecting research, and curtailing creativity.\n</p> \n <p>\nSurprisingly, in spite of all the common issues, there has been little or no cooperation on experimental methodologies between different computer science communities, who know very little of each others efforts. The goal of this seminar was to build stronger links and collaborations between computer science sub-communities around the pivotal concept of experimental analysis of software. Also, the seminar allowed exchange between communities their different views on experiments. The main target communities of this seminar were algorithm engineering, programming languages, operations research, and software engineering, but also people from other communities were invited to share their experiences. Our overall goal was to come up with a common foundation on how to evaluate software in general, and how to reproduce results. Since computer science is a leap behind natural sciences when it comes to experiments, the ultimate goal of the seminar was to make a step forward towards reducing this gap. The format of the seminar alternated talks intended for a broad audience, discussion panels, and working sessions in groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers would like to thank the Dagstuhl team and all the participants for making the seminar a success.

            "title": "Algebraic Methods in Computational Complexity",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar brought together more than 40 researchers covering\na wide spectrum of complexity theory. The focus on algebraic methods showed  the great importance of such techniques for theoretical computer science. We had  24\ntalks, most of them lasting about 45 minutes, leaving ample room for\ndiscussions. We also had a much appreciated rump  session on Tuesday evening in which Antonina Kolokolova, Bill Gasarch, Lance Fortnow, Chandran Saha, William Hoza, Neeraj Kajal and Arpita Korwar presented some open questions. \nIn the following we describe the major topics of discussion in more\ndetail.\n</p> \n <h4>Circuit Complexity</h4> \n <p>\nThis is an area of fundamental importance to Complexity.\nCircuits studied from many different perspectives were one of the main topics in the seminar. <em>Eric Allender</em> gave  an overview of the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP): given the truth-table for a Boolean function, what is the size of the minimum circuit computing it? In his talk he mentioned some interesting results proving that some low complexity classes cannot be reduced to the problem of computing superlinear approximations to circuit size. \n</p> \n <p>\nArithmetic circuits and formulas are a special computation model that uses  + and X as operators for computing polynomials instead of Boolean operations. <em>Nutan Limaye</em> presented a depth hierarchy theorem for this model showing that there is a polynomial computed by a depth D+1 polynomial sized multilinear formula such that any depth D multilinear formula computing the polynomial must have exponential size. \n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Chandan Saha</em> considered a further restriction to depth three \ncircuits C computing a polynomial f = T_1 + T_2 + ... + T_s, where each T_i is a product of d linear forms in n variables. He presented a randomized algorithm to reconstruct non-degenerate homogeneous depth three circuits, for the case n &gt; (3d)^2, given black-box access to f. The algorithm works in polynomial time in n, s and d.\n</p> \n <p>\nDepth-2 circuits with polynomial size and linear threshold functions were \npresented by <em>Meena Mahajan</em>. She surveyed the landscape below these circuits and present one new result concerning decision lists.\n</p> \n <h4>Algebraic Complexity</h4> \n <p>\nThere were also several presentations discussing the complexity of several problems over algebraic structures.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Nitin Saxena</em> considered in his talk the problem of testing whether a set F of polynomials given as algebraic circuits has an algebraic dependence. He showed that this problem can be computed in AM cap coAM thus solving an open question from 2007.\n</p> \n <p>\nProblems related to the minimum code-word problem and the existence of \nnon-trivial automorphism moving few vertices in graphs or hypergraphs, were presented by <em>V. Arvind</em> in his talk. He discuss the parameterized\ncomplexity of this and related algebraic problems.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Josh Alman</em> gave an interesting talk on Matrix Multiplication (MM).\nHe surveyed the two main approaches for MM  algorithms: the Laser method of Strassen, and the Group theoretic approach of Cohn and Umans and  defined \na generalization which subsumes these two approaches. He then explained ways to obtain lower bounds for algorithms for MM when using these algorithmic methods.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Rohit Gurjar</em> studied the class of matrices A for which the lattice L(A) formed by all integral vectors v in the null-space of A, has only polynomially many near-shortest vectors. He proved that this is the case\nwhen the matrix A is totally unimodular (all sub-determinants are 0, +1, or -1). As a consequence  he could show a deterministic algorithm for PIT \nfor any polynomial of the form det(sum x_i A_i) for rank-1 matrices A_i.\n</p> \n <h4>Pseudo-Randomness and Derandomization</h4> \n <p>Derandomization is an area where there are tight connections between lower bounds and algorithms. Strong enough circuit lower bounds can be used to construct pseudo-random generators that can then be used to deterministically simulate randomized algorithms. A central question in derandomization is whether randomized logspace RL equals deterministic logspace L. To show that RL = L, it suffices to construct explicit pseudorandom generators that fool polynomial-size read-once (oblivious) branching programs (roBPs).\nThere were two talks related to this question. <em>Michael Forbes</em>\npresented a method to obtain an explicit PRG with seed-length O(log^3 n) \nfor polynomial-size roBPs reading their bits in an unknown order. \n<em>William Hoza</em> gave an explicit hitting set generator for read-once branching programs with known variable order. As a corollary of this construction, it follows that every RL algorithm that uses r \nrandom bits can be simulated by an NL algorithm that uses only O(r/log^c n) nondeterministic bits, where c is an arbitrarily large constant. Another consequence of the result is that any RL algorithm with small success probability epsilon can be simulated deterministically in space \nO(log^{3/2} n+log n loglog(1/epsilon)). \n</p> \n <p>\nA hitting set is a set of instances such that every  non-zero polynomial in the \nmodel has a non-root in the set. This would solve the Polynomial Identity Testing  problem (PIT) in that  model. <em>Ramprasad Saptharishi</em> showed that by barely improving the trivial (s+1)^n size hitting set even for n-variate degree s, size s algebraic circuits, we could  get an almost \ncomplete derandomization of PIT.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn a second talk, <em>William Hoza</em> talked about the possibility of derandomizing an algorithm by using randomness from the input itself. \nFor a language L with a bounded-error randomized algorithm in space S and time n cdot poly(S)  he  gave a randomized algorithm for L with the same time and space resources but using only O(S) random bits; the algorithm has a low failure probability on all but a negligible fraction of inputs of each length.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Andrej Bogdanov</em> considered the problem of extracting true randomness from a set biased dice (Santha-Vazirani sources). He presented a recent result\nin which he completely classified all non-trivial randomness sources of this type into: non-extractable ones,  extractable from polynomially many samples, and extractable from an logarithmically many samples (in the inverse of the error). \n</p> \n <h4>Coding Theory</h4> \n <p>\nError-correcting codes and other kinds of codes, particularly those\nconstructed from polynomials, i.e. Reed-Solomon codes or Reed-Muller codes,\nlie at the heart of many significant results in Computational Complexity. This is  an area in which the relation between different areas of complexity, like the analysis of algebraic structures or derandomization becomes especially fruitful.\n</p> \n <p>\nGreatly improving previously known constructions for an odd size alphabet, <em>Michal Koucky</em> presented a construction of quasi-Gray codes of dimension n and length 3^n over the ternary alphabet {0,1,2} with worst-case read complexity O(log n) and write complexity 2. This generalizes to arbitrary odd-size alphabets. These results were obtained  via a novel application of algebraic tools together with the principles of catalytic computation. \n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Noga Ron-Zewi</em> presented a very recent result showing that Folded Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity with constant list sizes, \nindependent of the block length. She explained that  multiplicity codes exhibit similar behavior, and used this to obtain capacity achieving locally list decodable codes with query complexity significantly lower than previous constructions.\n</p> \n <p>\nBinary error correcting code with relative distance (1-epsilon)/2 and relative rate epsilon^{2+o(1)} were explained in one of the talks given by\n<em>Amnon Ta-Shma</em>.  Previous explicit constructions had rate about epsilon^3. The main tool used for this construction are <em>Parity Samplers</em>. He explained how to get better explicit parity samplers using a variant of the zig-zag product. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn his second talk, Amnon talked about (1-\tau,L) erasure list-decodable codes. He presented a recent work where he constructed for the first time  an explicit binary (1-\tau,L) erasure list-decodable code having rate \tau^{1+gamma}\n(for any constant gamma&gt;0 and \tau small enough) and list-size poly(log 1/\tau), exhibiting an explicit non-linear code that provably beats the best possible linear one. The main ingredient in his construction \nis a new (and almost-optimal) <em>unbalanced</em> two-source extractor. \n</p> \n <h4> Quantum Complexity</h4> \n <p>\nComplexity issues arising in the context of  quantum computation are\nan important area in Complexity Theory since several decades. In this \nworkshop we had one talk on this topic. <em>Sevag Gharibian</em> talked about quantum versions of the classical k-SAT problem. He talked about the problem of computing satisfying assignments to k-QSAT instances which have a \"matching\" or \"dimer covering\"; this is an NP problem whose decision variant is trivial, but whose search complexity remains open. He presented a parameterized algorithm for k-QSAT instances from a non-trivial class, which allows to obtain exponential speedups over brute force methods.\n</p> \n <h4>Conclusion</h4> \n <p>As is evident from the list above, the talks ranged over a broad assortment of subjects with the underlying theme of using algebraic and combinatorial techniques. It was a very fruitful meeting and has hopefully initiated new directions in research. Several participants specifically mentioned that they appreciated the particular focus on a common class of <em>techniques</em> (rather than end results) as a unifying theme of the workshop. We look forward\nto our next meeting!\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Markus Bl\u00e4ser, Valentine Kabanets, Jacobo Tor\u00e1n, and Christopher Umans\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Fresh Approaches to Business Process Modeling",
            "data": "\n <p>\nBusiness Process Management (BPM) has significantly advanced and gained high popularity in industry. However, it remains an open issue why tools frequently are used for business process modeling that are not mainly implemented for this purpose. Often, macros for Microsoft Visio or Microsoft Excel form the first choice to capture the flow of business activities. One reason why these tools might be used is the low training effort and the fast creation of a quick model, which can be generated with these tools. Another reason for the \"lower\" preference of BPM software tools might be their inability to respond to changes in technology and working styles, e.g. the shift towards \"agile\" processes and the \"flattening\" of workforce hierarchies that bring more stakeholders into contact with a much broader array of processing steps than before.\n</p> \n <p>\nA central question is whether the BPM community should create an entirely new paradigm for process modeling. One can think of more intuitive drawing conventions that laymen would use, and of models of an entirely different kind (i.e.~not process-centric and not data- or case-centric) that still bear the possibility to support modern and future business processes.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this seminar was to bring together a cross-disciplinary group of academic and industrial researchers to foster a better understanding of how to ease the access to, and applicability of, business process modeling. We discussed business process modeling approaches against emerging trends such as Internet of Things, the need for incremental and agile creation of new processes, and the need for workers to understand and participate in multiple contextual levels (e.g. transactional, business goals, strategic directions) while performing processes. The seminar also considered how new technologies, such as modern tools for UI design could be applied to support fundamental shifts in how processes are modeled and how humans are involved with their execution.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Richard Hull, Agnes Koschmider, Hajo A.

            "title": "Engineering Moral Agents \u2013 from Human Morality to Artificial Morality",
            "data": "\n <p>\nArtificial morality, also called \"machine ethics\", is an emerging field in artificial intelligence that explores how artificial agents can be enhanced with sensitivity to and respect for the legal, social, and ethical norms of human society. This field is also concerned with the possibility and necessity of transferring the responsibility for the decisions and actions of the artificial agents from their designers onto the agents themselves. Additional challenging tasks include, but are not limited to: the identification of (un)desired ethical behaviour in artificial agents and its adjustment; the certification and verification of the artificial agents' ethical capacities; the identification of the adequate level of responsibility of an artificial agent; the dependence between the responsibility and the level of autonomy that an artificial agent possesses; and the place of artificial agents within our societal, legal, and ethical normative systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nArtificial morality has become increasingly salient since the early years of this\ncentury, though its origins are older. Isaac Asimov already famously proposed three laws of robotics, requiring that, first, robots must not harm humans or allow them to be harmed; second, robots must obey human orders provided this does not conflict with the first law; and third, robots must protect themselves provided this does not conflict with the first two laws. \n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough there has been some discussion and analysis of possible approaches to artificial morality in computer science and related fields, the \"algorithmization\"\nand adaptation of the ethical systems developed for human beings is both an open research problem and a difficult engineering challenge. At the same time, formally and mathematically oriented approaches to ethics are attracting the interest of an increasing number of researchers, including in philosophy. As this is still in\nits infancy, we thought that the area could benefit from an \"incubator event\" such as an interdisciplinary Dagstuhl seminar.\n\nWe conducted a five-day seminar with twenty six participants with diverse academic backgrounds including robotics, automated systems, philosophy, law, security, and political science. The first part of the seminar was dedicated to facilitating the cross-disciplinary communication by giving researchers across the contributing\ndisciplines an integrated overview of current research in machine morality from the artificial intelligence side, and of relevant areas of philosophy from the moral-philosophy, action-theoretic, and social-scientific side. We accomplished this through tutorials and brief self-introductory talks. The second part of the seminar was dedicated to discussions around two key topics: how to formalise ethical theories and reasoning, and how to implement ethical reasoning. This report summarises some of the highlights of those discussions and includes the abstracts of the tutorials and some of the self-introductory talks. We also summarise our conclusions and observations from the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough scientists without a philosophical background tend to have a general view of moral philosophy, a formal background and ability to pinpoint key advancements and central work in it cannot be taken for granted.  Kevin Baum from the University of Saarland presented a project currently in progress at his university and in which he is involved, of teaching formal ethics to computer-science students. There was great interest in the material of that course from the computer science participants of the seminar. In the first instance, a good catalyst for the computer science--moral philosophy cooperation would be a comprehensive \"data base\" of moral-dilemma examples from the literature that can be used as benchmarks when formalising and implementing moral reasoning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe formalisation of moral theories for the purpose of using them as a\nbase for implementing moral reasoning in machines, and artificial\nautonomous entities in general, was met with great enthusiasm among\nnon-computer scientists. Such work gives a unique opportunity to test\nthe robustness of moral theories.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt is generally recognised that there exist two core approaches to\nartificial morality: explicitly constraining the potentially immoral actions of\nthe AI system; and training the AI system to recognise and resolve morally\nchallenging situations and actions. The first, constrained-based approach consists in finding a set of rules and guidelines that the artificial intentional entity has to follow, or that we can use to pre-check and constrain its actions. By contrast, training approaches consist in applying techniques such as machine learning to \"teach\" an artificial intentional entity to recognise morally problematic situations and to resolve conflicts, much as people are educated by their carers and community to become moral agents. Hybrid approaches combining both methods were also considered.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt emerged that a clear advantage of constraining the potentially immoral actions of the entity, or the \"symbolic approach\" to ethical reasoning, is the possibility to use formal verification to test that the reasoning works as intended. If the  learning approach is used, the learning should happen before the autonomous system is deployed for its moral behaviour to be tested.  Unfortunately, the machine-learning community was  severely under-represented at the seminar, and more efforts should be devoted to include them in future discussions. The discussions also revealed that implanting moral reasoning into autonomous systems opens up many questions regarding the level of assurance that should be given to users of such systems, as well as the level of transparency into the moral-reasoning software that should be given to users, regulators, governments, and so on.\n</p> \n <p>\nMachine ethics is a topic that will continue to develop in the coming years, particularly with many industries preparing to launch autonomous systems into our societies in the next five years. It is essential to continue open cross-disciplinary discussions to make sure that the machine reasoning implemented in those machines is designed by experts who have a deep understanding of the topic, rather than by individual companies without the input of such experts. It was our impression as organisers, perhaps immodest, that the seminar advanced the field of machine ethics and opened new communication channels. Therefore we hope to propose a second seminar in 2018 on the same topic, using the experience and lessons we\ngained here, to continue the discussion and flow of cross-disciplinary\ncollaboration.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michael Fisher and Christian List and Marija Slavkovic and Alan FT Winfield\n                </div> \n",

Examples of cutting-edge application areas with a strong algorithmic flavor include <em>self-assembling systems</em>, in which chemical and biological substances such as DNA are designed to form predetermined shapes or carry out massively parallel computations; and <em>swarm robotics</em>, in which complex tasks are achieved through the local interactions of robots with highly limited individual capabilities, including micro- and nano-robots.

We built on the success of that seminar by expanding its\nfocus on particular challenges that arise from the application areas of programmable matter. For this purpose, we brought together a combination of established experts from DNA computing, swarm robotics, computational geometry, and distributed computing. On the senior level, particants included a number of leading authorities who are established in more than one of the mentioned topics; on the junior level, we had a good selection of highly talented scientists who are able to advance the field by specific contributions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with a plenary introduction of all participants, their research areas and their specific challenges and expectations for the seminar.

A second part consisted of a survey of DNA strand displacement, including the problem of orienting molecules on a surface with the use of DNA origami and some clever shapes that can \"align\" themselves into target placements.\n</li><li> Andr\u00e9a Richa presented an overview of <b>self-organizing particle systems</b>, describing programmable matter as an abstract collection of simple\ncomputational elements (particles) with limited memory that each execute fully\ndistributed, local, asynchronous algorithms to self-organize and solve\nsystem-wide problems such as movement, (re)configuration, and coordination.\n</li><li> Aaron Becker discussed the connection between <b>robot swarms and programmable matter</b>, in particular in a setting with a global input to a whole particle swarm, as well as open questions arising from the use of mobile robots to fold 2D planar stock into 3D bricks and to connect the bricks together.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nSpread throughout the week, further presentations were given by Spring Berman (applications and open challenges in swarm robotics and a control-theoretic framework for robotic swarms and programmable matter), Julien Bourgeois (realizing programmable matter with modular robots),  Luca Cardelli (sequenceable DNA algorithms),  Kenneth Cheung (programmable modular periodic metamaterials),  S\u00e1ndor Fekete (coordinated motion planning), Roderich Gro\u00df (capabilities of individual units in distributed robotic systems and making programmable matter self-propel efficiently), Dan Halperin (hard vs. easy tasks in multi-robot motion planning), Heiko Hamann (self-assembly and collective construction based on minimal surprise), Lila Kari (DNA smart-tile self-assembly and computational CRISPR), MinJun Kim (engineering particles for robot swarms and modular microrobotics), Alcherio Martinoli (fluid-mediated stochastic self-assembly), Friedhelm Meyer auf der Heide (continuous strategies for swarm robotics), Nils Napp (autonomous construction in unstructured environments), Pekka Orponen (algorithmic design of RNA nanostructures) and \nChristian Scheideler (a survey on hybrid programmable matter). \n</p> \n <p>\nA key feature of the seminar was exceptionally intensive, interdisciplinary\ncollaboration throughout the week, based on the use of the new interactive electronic tool coauthor. This \n<a href=\"https://github.com/edemaine/coauthor/\">tool</a>,\nspecifically developed for use in a workshop-like environment, is an excellent\nplatform that provides a versatile medium for collaborative research\ndiscussions, and maintains easily accessible structured records for future\nreference. We have found that coauthor greatly facilitated the work done during the seminar, enabling not just identification of, but also dynamic research work on a number of new topics. These include (A) specific problems in the context of hybrid models for programmable matter, in which there is a set of active micro-robots that can move a large set of simple material tiles that cannot move themselves; (B) aspects of distributed boundary detection for\nself-organizing swarms; (C) fundamental issues related to the computational equivalence of completely different self-assembly systems and robotic models; and (D) questions of self-aligning geometric shapes that would allow more robust methods for DNA origami and self-assembly. For some aspects, we were able to resolve long-standing open problems; for others, we made significant progress that will undoubtedly lead to future publications. As a consequence, the seminar has triggered a number of new collaborations and a variety of followup projects that will undoubtedly contribute to further collaborative research activities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Spring Berman, S\u00e1ndor Fekete, Matthew J.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe miniaturization of optical devices and advances in computer vision, as well as a lower cost point, have led to an increased integration of gaze sensing capabilities in computing systems, from desktop computing to mobile devices and wearables. With these advances in technology, new application areas for gaze sensing are emerging. Eye tracking is no longer restricted to a well-controlled laboratory setting, but moving into everyday settings. When technology makes forays into new environments, there are many questions to be resolved and challenges to be met, from computational to applications and interaction.  \nUbiquitous gaze sensing and interaction require a framework that can accommodate compatible solutions from data acquisition to signal processing to pattern classification and computer vision to visualization and analytics. Including gaze data into interactive applications requires knowledge of natural gaze behaviors as well as how gaze is coordinate with other modalities and actions.\n</p> \n <p>\nTherefore, this Dagstuhl Seminar brought together computer scientists and gaze researchers to explore future ubiquitous applications and to identify requirements for reliable gaze sensing technology. Ubiquitous gaze sensing and interaction cannot be achieved by research discipline, but require knowledge and scientific advancement in multiple fields. And, of utmost importance is that researchers from different disciplines meet, interact, and address their common challenges. For this reason, experts in computer graphics, signal processing, visualization, human-computer interaction, data analytics, pattern analysis and classification along with researchers who  employ gaze tracking across diverse disciplines attended: geo-information systems, medicine, aviation, psychology, neuroscience, etc. This fostered a dialogue and allowed: (1) computing scientists to understand the problems that are faced in recording and interpreting gaze data, (2) gaze researchers to consider how modern computing techniques could potentially advance their research. In addition, we discussed the ethical and privacy concerns of deploying gaze monitoring devices in everyday scenarios.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe workshop was organized to identify identifying possible <b>scenarios</b> and pinpointing the associated <b>challenges</b> of developing and deploying ubiquitous gaze sensing during the first day. Challenges identified by multiple scenarios, or the ones that were considered to be significant were the focus of in-depth cross-disciplinary groups. These challenges were discussed on the second day. In three sessions taking place during the day, five challenges were debated. \"Data Privacy\" and \"Gaze + X\" were two of the most important topics and received multiple dedicated sessions of discussion due to the high interest of the participants. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the third day the Dagstuhl Seminar finally discussed future work and how to get the research community engaged in researching the various interesting topics covered. Some of the suggestions were to organize workshops at conferences and organizing a special issue focused on ubiquitous gaze sensing. Several of the discussion groups started brainstorming on papers covering the important topics raised at the workshop.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Tanja Blascheck, Lewis Chuang, Andrew Duchowski, Pernilla Qvarfordt, and Daniel Weiskopf\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nDagstuhl Seminar 21332, \"Understanding I/O behavior in scientific and\ndata-intensive computing,\" brought together computer scientists from around\nthe world to survey how I/O workloads are measured and analyzed on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, identify gaps in methodologies, and debate how to best apply this technology to advance HPC productivity.  The hybrid, week-long event attracted 10 physical and 25 virtual attendees.  They included\nrepresentatives from seven countries spanning a variety of career levels in\nacademia, industry, and government.  The diversity of perspectives, combined\nwith an intense week-long seminar format, offered an unprecedented\nopportunity for researchers to share ideas and spark new collaborative\nopportunities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar agenda was structured as a combination of full-group plenary\nsessions and subgroup breakout sessions. The plenary sessions were used to\ndiscuss high-level issues, vote on subtopics to investigate, relay results    from breakout sessions, and present ``lightning'' talks that highlighted key\nissues in the community.  The breakout sessions employed small groups\n(roughly five people each) to follow up in ``deep dive'' discussions on specific subtopics.  This format enabled attendees from numerous time zones to remain productively engaged throughout the week.  We also found it to be successful in facilitating discussion despite the COVID-19 safety considerations that prevented us from assembling at a single venue.  The final day of the seminar was devoted to recording seminar findings in a timely manner while subject matter experts were still available for consultation.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the course of the seminar, the attendees converged on six high-level\ntopics for deep dive discussions that are covered in this report.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Tools: Cross-Cutting Issues</b> (Section 4.1) explored common challenges in development of tools for understanding HPC I/O.\n</li><li><b>Data Sources and Acquisition</b> (Section 4.2) addressed how to acquire various forms of raw I/O instrumentation from production systems.\n</li><li><b>Analysis</b> (Section 4.3) focused on how to interpret I/O instrumentation once acquired.\n</li><li><b>Enacting Actionable Responses</b> (Section 4.4) investigated how to best utilize the outcomes from I/O analysis.\n</li><li><b>Data Center Support</b> (Section 4.5) focused on strategies for facility operators to facilitate better understanding of I/O behavior.\n</li><li><b>Community Support</b> (Section 4.6) explored the unique characteristics of the I/O analysis community and how to foster its growth.\n</li></ul> \n <p>This report presents a separate summary for each deep dive topic, including a survey of the state of the art, gaps, challenges, and recommendations. The report concludes in Section 5 with a summary of cross-cutting themes and recommendations produced by the seminar as a whole. We found that understanding I/O behavior in scientific and data-intensive computing is increasingly important in an era of evolving workloads and increasingly complex HPC\nsystems and that several cross-cutting challenges must be addressed in order to maximize its potential.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Philip Carns, Julian Kunkel, Kathryn Mohror, and Martin Schulz\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Visual Analytics for Sets over Time and Space",
            "data": "\n <h3>Seminar Goals</h3> \n <p>Increasing amounts of data offer great opportunities to promote\ntechnological progress and business success. Visual analytics aims at\nenabling the exploration and the understanding of large and complex\ndata sets by intertwining interactive visualization, data analysis,\nhuman-computer interaction, as well as cognitive and perceptual\nscience. Cartography has for thousands of years dealt with the\ndepiction of spatial data, and more recently geovisual analytics\nresearchers have joined forces with the visual analytics community to\ncreate visualizations to help people to make better and faster\ndecisions about complex problems that require the analysis of big\ndata.\n</p> \n <p>Set systems comprise a generic data model for families of sets.  A\n<em>set</em> is defined as a collection of unique objects, called the\nset elements, with attributes, membership functions, and rules.  Such\na complex data model asks for appropriate exploration methods.\nAs with many types of data, set systems can vary over time and space.\nIt is important, however, not to treat time and space as usual\nvariables.  Their special characteristics such as different\ngranularities, time primitives (time points vs. intervals),\nhierarchies of geographic or administrative regions need to be taken\ninto account.  Visualizing and analyzing such changes is challenging\ndue to the size and complexity of the data sets.\n</p> \n <p>Sets systems can also be seen as hypergraphs where the vertices\nrepresent the ground elements and the edges are the sets.  However,\ncompared to conventional graphs that represent only binary relations\n(that is, sets with two elements), the visualization of general\nhypergraphs has received little attention.  This is even more so when\ndealing with dynamic hypergraphs or hypergraphs that represent spatial\ninformation.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this seminar, we aimed at bringing together researchers from the\nareas of visual analytics, information visualization and graph\ndrawing, geography and GIScience, as well as cartography and (spatial)\ncognition, in order to develop a theory and visualization methods for\nset systems that vary over time and space.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>\nAs the topic of the seminar was interdisciplinary and the participants had very different\nscientific backgrounds, we introduced the main themes of the seminar in three separate\nsections: \u201cSets in Time\u201d, \u201cSets in Space\u201d, and \u201cGraph Drawing and Set Visualization\u201d. Each\nsection consisted of a survey talk and three to four short talks. The three sections were\nfollowed by a panel discussion. For the survey talks, we explicitly asked the presenters\nto give a balanced overview over their area (rather than to focus on their own scientific\ncontributions).\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the second day of the seminar, we collected a number of challenging open problems.\nThen we formed five groups, each of which worked on a specific open problem for the\nremainder of the seminar. The work within the groups was interrupted only a few times;\nin order to share progress reports, listen to open-mic talks, and to discuss possible future\nactivities. These plenary meetings helped to exchange the different visions of the working\ngroups.\n</p> \n <p>We now list the items of the program in detail.</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Section \"Sets in Time\" (for abstracts, see Section 3)\n<ul>\n<li> Peter Rogers gave an excellent survey talk about techniques for visualizing sets over time. He illustrated possible challenges and opportunities in this research area.\n</li><li> Philipp Kindermann presented some results and open questions in simultaneous orthogonal graph drawing.\n </li><li> Wouter Meuleman talked about spatially and temporally coherent visual summaries.\n</li><li> Tamara Mchedlidze introduced a data-driven approach to quality metrics of graph visualizations.\n</li><li> Margit Pohl discussed perception considerations of space and time in cognitive psychology and their implications for the design of visualizations.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li> Section ``Sets in Space'' (for abstracts, see Section 4)\n<ul>\n<li> Sara Fabrikant gave an inspiring  survey talk about space discussed from a cartographer\u2018s view.\n</li><li> Natalia Andrienko elaborated about evolving sets in space.\n </li><li> Somayeh Dodge discussed dynamic visualization of interaction in movement of sets.\n </li><li> Jan-Henrik Haunert introduced fast retrieval of abstracted representations for sets of points within user-specified temporal ranges.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li> Section \"Graph Drawing and Set Visualization\" (for abstracts, see Section 5)\n<ul>\n<li> Andr\u00e9 Schulz very nicely surveyed the area of drawing graphs and hypergraphs and sketched the main challenges in this area.\n</li><li> Michalis Bekos gave a short overview of graph drawing beyond planarity.\n</li><li> Sabine Cornelsen talked about general support for hypergraphs.\n</li><li> Martin N\u00f6llenburg introduced plane supports for spatial hypergraphs.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li> The panel discussion was entitled \"Visual Analytics for Sets over Time and Space: What are the burning scientific questions? An interdisciplinary perspective.\"\nAndr\u00e9 Skupin, Steven Kobourov, and Susanne Bleisch each gave a short statement about the central questions of his or her area; see Section 6. Afterwards we had a fruitful and interesting discussion, which led to a productive open problem session.\n    \n</li><li> The working groups formed around the following open problems:\n<ul>\n<li> \"Concentric Set Schematization\",\n</li><li> \"From Linear Diagrams to Interval Graphs\",\n</li><li> \"Thread Visualization\",\n</li><li> \"Clustering Colored Points in the Plane\", and\n</li><li> \"Flexible Visualization of Sets over Time and Space\".\n</li></ul>\n</li></ol> \n <p>The reports of the working groups were collected by Michalis Bekos, Steven Chaplick, William\nEvans, Jan-Henrik Haunert, and Christian Tominski; see Section 7.\n</p> \n <h3>Future Plans</h3> \n <p>\nDuring our seminar, plans for a follow-up seminar were discussed in a\nplenary meeting.  The seminar-to-be will aim at integrating the\napproaches for set visualization that have been taken by the different\ncommunities (geovisualization, information visualization, and graph\ndrawing, including industry and research).  Susanne Bleisch, Steven\nChaplick, Jan-Henrik Haunert, and Eva Mayr are currently discussing\nthe precise focus and a title to match that focus.\n</p> \n <p>Among the 29 participants of the seminar, 24 participated in the survey that Dagstuhl\ndoes at the end of every seminar. Many answers were in line with the average reactions that\nDagstuhl collected over a period of 60 days before our seminar (such as the scientific quality\nof the seminar, which received a median of 10 out of 11 \u2013 \u201coutstanding\u201d). A few questions,\nhowever, received different feedback. For example, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the\nseminar, we had more frequent Dagstuhl visitors than usually: a third of the participants\nof the survey had been to Dagstuhl at least seven times. It was also interesting to see that\nmore participants than usually stated that our seminar had inspired new research ideas, joint\nprojects or publications, that it had led to insights from neighboring fields, and that it had\nidentified new research directions.\n</p> \n <p>In spite of the organizers\u2019 attempt to have a diverse group of participants, all survey\nparticipants were from academia and only two rated themselves as \u201cjunior\u201d. Not surprisingly,\nsome participants suggested to have more PhD students, more people from industry, and generally more people from applications rather than from (graph drawing) theory. The last\nfree text comment in the survey reads: \u201cOnce again, a great week at Schloss Dagstuhl \u2013\nthank you!\u201d\n</p> \n <h3>Aknowledgements</h3> \n <p>We all enjoyed the unique Dagstuhl atmosphere. In particular, it was great to have the\nopportunity to use a separate room for each working group. We thank Philipp Kindermann\nfor collecting the self-introductory slides before the seminar and for assembling this report\nafter the seminar.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sara Irina Fabrikant, Silvia Miksch, and Alexander Wolff\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nA total of 63 people were invited to the seminar in the first round of invitations. 39 people attended, with 15 of those attending the seminar virtually. Participants came from both academia and industry and at varying stages of their careers. As this seminar took place at the trailing end of the Covid-19 pandemic, it ran in a hybrid format, and for many attendees, Dagstuhl was the first in-person seminar in several years. Due to the fantastic facilities of the Dagstuhl campus, the hybrid format was a great success, enabling accessible and inclusive communication with remote participants. Daily Covid testing for those in-person ensured that everyone remained safe throughout the week. Eighteen presented their work in around 15-30 minute presentations; an abstract for each talk is included in this report. \n</p> \n <p>\nAlongside traditional presentations, many sessions were left available for activities suggested by the seminar participants. These could involve workshops, discussions, presentations, or any other suggested format. During the week, participants could propose plans for the flexible sessions and the structure of the seminar became fixed as activities and topics for the sessions were provided. Summaries for the results of these flexible sessions are contained in this report. One slot was reserved for a joint group discussion on the ethical concerns of the research we are developing. This resulted in a vivid discussion on the steps we as a community should be taking to encourage the ethical use of the technology we are developing. One of the discussions that received broad support was the design of a cheap, open-source method for collecting camera calibrated illumination environments. This resulted in a Slack channel for the group of interested researchers and the pursuit of an early prototype design. We started the seminar with a short introduction from all participants. Everyone was given one slide to introduce themselves and asked to prepare a question, challenge or goal to discuss during the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    James Gardner, Bernhard Egger, William Smith, Christian Theobalt, and Stefanie Wuhrer\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "A Shared Challenge in Behavioural Specification",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar dealt with the issue of behavioural specification from the viewpoint of runtime verification. Runtime verification (RV) as a field is broadly defined as focusing on processing execution traces (output of an observed system) for verification and validation purposes. Of particular interest is the problem of verifying that a sequence of events, a trace, satisfies a temporal property, formulated in a suitable formalism. Examples of such formalisms include state machines, regular expressions, temporal logics, context-free grammars, variations of the mu-calculus, rule systems, stream processing systems, and process algebras. Of special interest is how to specify data-rich systems, where events themselves carry data. Applications cover such domains as security monitoring and safety monitoring.\n</p> \n <p>\nSuch techniques are characterised by highly expressive languages for specifying behaviour, enabled by the concreteness of dealing directly with single runtime traces, which makes the verification problem tractable. However, this permitted expressiveness has also led to a divergence in such languages. The aim of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to shed light on the similarities and differences between these different formalisms, and specifically, suggest directions for future collaboration and research. This effort can potentially lead to an attempt to standardize an RV formalism.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar included a mixture of tool developers, theoreticians, and industry experts and the above aim was addressed by two main activities. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe first activity was that each tool developer was asked to produce a brief summary of their specification language in the form of a set of short examples. These were then presented as talks during the Seminar, alongside other general contributed talks on issues surrounding behavioural specification. The examples were uploaded to a shared repository (which will be available via runtime-verification.org) and eleven participants added their tool descriptions and examples to this repository, producing a lasting resource from the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe second activity was carried out through eight working groups formed during the Seminar to discuss topics raised by the talks. The results of this working groups are detailed in this report. We take this opportunity to detail the topics (in the form of questions) proposed during the seminar that were not chosen for discussion in working groups:\n</p> <ul>\n<li><em>Where should we get specifications from?</em> This question addressed both the issue of designing specification languages that can be usable by engineers but also the trending topic of inferring specifications from various artifacts and how specification languages can support this.\n</li><li><em>How can we measure specification quality?</em> What is a good specification, or when is one specification better than another? This might be related to coverage of the system being specified, or might be about interpretability or some other measure of usability.\n</li><li><em>How do we ensure our specification language is not broken?</em> This question was inspired by the experience of one speaker with developing the industrial-strength PSL language and the issues surrounding getting it right.\n</li><li><em>How can we balance different levels of abstraction (e.g. local and global behaviour) in a specification?</em> It was noted that specification languages are often closely associated with specifications at a certain level of abstraction. Is this an inherent restriction or a positive feature? Should we build specification languages with a certain level of abstraction in mind? \n</li><li><em>How do we unify the different uses of a specification?</em> This was inspired by the observation that a specification may be used to explain behaviour, check behaviour, or synthesize behaviour, and different presentations may be preferred in these different contexts.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThis seminar was the first time the runtime verification community has reflected on the broad issue of specification and has fed into further developments including new perspectives for the international runtime verification competition, a proposed shared challenge involving the NASA core flight system, and the first informal survey and categorisation of actively developed runtime verification tools.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Giles Reger, Klaus Havelund, Martin Leucker, and Volker Stolz\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Dynamic Traffic Models in Transportation Science",
            "data": "\n <p>\nTraffic assignment models play an important role for traffic planners to predict traffic distributions, especially, in light of possible changes of the infrastructure, e.g., road constructions, traffic light controls, speed limits, tolls, etc. The prevailing <em>mathematical</em> approaches used in the transportation science literature to predict such distributions can be roughly classified into static traffic assignment models based on aggregated static multi-commodity flow formulations and dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models based on the methodology of flows over time. While static models have seen several decades of development and practical use, they abstract away too many important details and, thus, become less attractive. On the other hand, dynamic models are known to be notoriously hard to analyze in terms of existence, uniqueness and computability of dynamic equilibria.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn light of the prevailing computational difficulties for realistic-sized networks, the systematic optimization of such networks (e.g., by designing the network infrastructure,  link tolls, or traffic light controls) becomes even more challenging as the resulting mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints contain already in the lower level presumably \"hard\" optimization-, complementarity- or variational inequality problems; not to speak of the resulting optimization problem for the first level.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the other hand, there is a trend in the transportation science community to use <em>large-scale computer-based microsimulations</em> for predicting traffic distributions. The striking advantage of microscopic simulations over DTA models is that the latter usually ignores the feedback of changing network conditions on user behavior dimensions such as flexible departure time choice, mode choice, activity schedule choice, and such. Current simulation tools integrate all these dimensions and many more.  The increasing model complexity, however, is by far not matched  by the existing theory of dynamic traffic assignments. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together leading researchers from three different communities - Simulations (SIM), Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) and Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT). This years seminar was centered around three topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Horizontal queueing models</em>. Most of the static traffic assignment models assume that queues can occur, but do not take up any physical space. In order to make the current models more realistic one should assume that queues might effect traffic on other nearby road segments, thus, include possible spill-back effects. \n</li><li><em>Oligopolistic competition</em>. With the rise of autonomous vehicles new routing decisions need to be made. As a novel aspect, individual vehicles might to be interested in selfishly optimizing their routes, but cooperate with other vehicles using the same software in order to decrease the average journey time.  \n</li><li><em>Risk-averse travelers</em>. Current static traffic models often assume that each player is rational, and has the sole purpose of minimizing travel time or distance. However, the exact travel time of many routes might be uncertain at the moment of departure. Hence, travelers might stick to a more predictable route and might be unwilling to explore possibly better alternatives.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Again, the seminar was a big success both in terms of stimulating new and very fruitful collaborations. We got enthusiastic feedback from many participants which is also reflected in the survey conducted by Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Roberto Cominetti, Tobias Harks, Carolina Osorio, and Britta Peis\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Progressive Data Analysis and Visualization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nWe live in an era where data is abundant and growing rapidly; databases to handle big data are sprawling out past memory and computation limits, and across distributed systems. New hardware and software systems have been built to sustain this growth in terms of storage management and predictive computation. However, these infrastructures, while good for data at scale, do not support data exploration well. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe concept of exploratory data analysis (EDA) was introduced by John Tukey in the 1970's and is now a commonplace in visual analytics. EDA allows users to make sense of data with little or no known model;  it is essential in many application domains, from network security and fraud detection to epidemiology and preventive medicine. For most datasets, it is considered a best practice to explore data before beginning to construct formal hypotheses. Data exploration is done through an iterative loop where analysts interact with data through computations that return results, usually shown with visualizations. Analysts reacting to these results and visualizations issue new commands triggering new computations until they answer their questions.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, due to human cognitive constraints, exploration needs highly responsive system response times (see <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/\">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/</a>): at 500 ms, users change their querying behavior; past five or ten seconds, users abandon tasks or lose attention.  As datasets grow and computations become more complex, response time suffers. To address this problem, a new computation paradigm has emerged in the last decade under several names: online aggregation in the database community; progressive, incremental, or iterative visualization in other communities. It consists of splitting long computations into a series of approximate results improving with time; the results are then returned at a controlled pace.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis paradigm addresses scalability problems, as analysts can keep their attention on the results of long analyses as they arrive progressively. Initial research has shown promising results in progressive analysis for both big database queries and for machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe widespread use of progressive data analysis has been hampered by a chicken-and-egg problem: data visualization researchers do not have online database systems to work against, and database researchers do not have tools that will display the results of their work. As a result, progressive visualization systems are based on simulated systems or early prototypes. In many cases, neither side has currently incentive, skills, or resources to build the components needed.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecently, data analysis researchers and practitioners have started conversations with their colleagues involved in the data analysis pipeline to combine their efforts. This standard pipeline includes the following core communities: data management, statistics and machine learning and interactive visualization. These initial conversations have led to fruitful evolutions of systems, combining two or three of these communities to complete a pipeline. Database and visualization have collaborated to create systems allowing progressive, approximate query results. Machine-learning and visualization have collaborated to create systems combining progressive multidimensional projections with appropriate scalable visualizations, such as Progressive t-SNE. Most current machine learning algorithms are designed to examine the entirety of a dataset. A major contribution of work like Progressive t-SNE is to have a decomposable algorithm that can compute a meaningful partial result, which then can be passed on to a visual interface for fluent exploration. In these few existing collaborations, the researchers are able to work together and find concrete mechanisms by adapting existing systems for these  without re-building them from the ground up. A systematic and widespread linkage between the involved communities, however, is still largely absent. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar brought the researchers and practitioners who have started this software evolutionary process to exchange their ideas, experience, and visions. We are convinced that in the forthcoming years, progressive data analysis will become a leading paradigm for data exploration systems, but will require major changes in the algorithms and data structures in use today. The scientific communities involved need to understand the constraints and possibilities from their colleagues to converge faster, with a deeper awareness of the implications of this paradigm shift. The implications are technical, but also human, both perceptual and cognitive, and the seminar will provide a holistic view of the problem by gathering specialists from all the communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis summary summarizes the outcomes of  our seminar. The seminar focused on\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> defining and formalizing the concept of progressive data analysis,\n</li><li> addressing fundamental issues for progressive data analysis, such as software architecture, management of uncertainty, and human aspects,\n</li><li> identifying evaluation methods to assess the quality of progressive systems, and threats to research on the topic,\n</li><li> examining applications in data science, machine learning, and time-series analysis.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAs a major result from the seminar, the following problems have been identified: \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Implementing fully functional progressive systems will be difficult, since the progressive model is incompatible with most of the existing data analysis stack,\n</li><li> The human side of progressive data analysis requires further research to investigate how visualization systems and user interfaces should be adapted to help humans cope with progressiveness,\n</li><li> The potentials of progressive data analysis are huge, in particular it would reconcile exploratory data analysis with big data and modern machine learning methods,\nitem</li><li>data analysis and visualization mainstream in research and application domains.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jean-Daniel Fekete, Danyel Fisher, and Michael Sedlmair\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Loop Optimization",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nLoop optimization is at the heart of effective program optimization - even if the source language is too abstract to contain loop constructs explicitly as, e.g., in a functional style or a domain-specific language. Loops provide a major opportunity to improve the performance of a program because they represent compactly a large volume of accessed data and executed instructions. Because the clock frequency of processors fails to continue to grow (end of Dennard scaling), the only way in which the execution of programs can be accelerated is by increasing their throughput with a compiler: by increasing parallelism and improving data locality. This puts loop optimization in the center of performance optimization.\n</p> \n <h3>Context</h3> \n <p>\nThe quick and easy way to optimize a loop nest, still frequently used in practice, is by restructuring the source program, e.g., by permuting, tiling or skewing the loop nest. Beside being laborious and error-prone, this approach favors modifications that can be easily recognized and carried out, but which need not be the most suitable choice. A much better approach is to search automatically for optimization options in a mathematical model of the iteration space, in which all options are equally detectable and the quality of each option can be assessed precisely.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecently, the polyhedral compilation community has produced a set of robust and powerful libraries that contain a variety of algorithms for the manipulation of Presburger sets, including all standard polyhedral compilation techniques. They can be incorporated in a program analysis to make other compiler optimizations more precise and powerful, like optimizers and code generators for domain-specific languages, or aggressive optimizers for high-performance computing.\n</p> \n <p>\nPolyhedral loop optimization relies on strict constraints on the structure of the loop nest and may incur a computationally complex program analysis, based on integer linear programming. The optimization problems become much simpler when information at load or run time is available, i.e., the optimization is done just-in-time. Also, the search for the best optimization can be supported by other techniques, e.g., auto-tuning, machine learning or genetic algorithms. While these techniques are all fully automatic, engineering of software with robust performance characteristics requires programmers to have some level of explicit control over the data distribution and communication costs. However, manually optimized code is far too complicated to maintain. Thus, a major research area concerns the design of tools that allow developers to guide or direct analysis (e.g., via dependence summaries or domain-specific code generation) and optimization (e.g., via directives, sketches and abstractions for schedules and data partitioning).\n</p> \n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>The goal of this seminar was to generate a new synergy in loop optimization research by bringing together representatives of the major different schools of thought in this field. The key unifying idea is to formulate loop optimization as a mathematical problem, by characterizing the optimization space and objectives with respect to a suitable model.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne school is focused on reasoning about scheduling and parallelization using a geometric, \"polyhedral\", model of iteration spaces which supports powerful tools for measuring parallelism, locality and communication -- but which is quite limited in its applicability.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother major school treats program optimization as program synthesis, for example by equational rewriting, generating a potentially large space of variants which can be pruned with respect to properties like load balance and locality. This approach has flourished in certain application domains, but also suffers from problems with generalization.\n</p> \n <p>\nA third family of loop optimization approaches tackles program optimization through program generation and symbolic evaluation. Generative approaches, such as explicit staging, support programmers in taking explicit control over implementation details at a high level of abstraction.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar explored the interplay of these various loop optimization techniques and fostered the communication in the wide-ranging research community of model-based loop optimization. Participants represented the various loop optimization approaches but also application domains in high-performance computing.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusions</h3> \n <p>The seminar succeeded in making the participants aware of common goals and relations between different approaches. Consensus emerged on the potential and importance of tensor contractions and tensor comprehensions as an intermediate representation. There was also some excitement in connecting the classical dependence-based optimization with newly emerging ideas in deriving parallel algorithms from sequentially-dependent code automatically. Guided automatic search and inference turned out to be a dominant theme. Another important insight was that the optimization criteria currently in use are often too coarse-grained and do not deliver satisfactory performance. More precise hardware models are needed to guide optimization. This will require a closer collaboration with the performance modeling and engineering community.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt was agreed that publications and collaborations fueled by the seminar will acknowledge Schloss Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sebastian Hack, Paul H.

Contrary to decision, optimization and even counting problems, the output length of enumeration problems  is often exponential in the size of the input and cannot be neglected. This motivates the classical approach in enumeration, now called output-sensitive, which measures running time in (input and) output length, and asks for output-polynomial  algorithms and algorithms of polynomial delay. This approach has been studied since a long time and has produced its own important open questions, among them the question whether the minimal transversals of a hypergraph can be enumerated in output-polynomial time. This longstanding and challenging question  has triggered a lot of research. It is open for more than fifty years and most likely the best known open problem in algorithmic enumeration.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecently as a natural extension on  research in exact exponential-time algorithms, a new approach, called input-sensitive, which measures the running time in the input length, has found growing interest. Due to the number of objects to enumerate (in the worst case),  the corresponding algorithms have exponential running time. So far branching algorithms are a major tool.  Input-sensitive enumeration is strongly related to lower and upper combinatorial bounds on the maximum number of  objects to be enumerated for an input of given size. Such bounds can be achieved via input-sensitive enumeration algorithms but also by the use of combinatorial (non-algorithmic) means. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe area of algorithmic enumeration is in a nascent state, though it has a huge potential due to theoretical challenges and practical applications. While output-sensitive enumeration has a long history, input-sensitive enumeration has been initiated only recently. Natural and promising approaches like using parameterized or approximative approaches have not been explored yet in their full capacities. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe principal goals of our Dagstuhl seminar were  to increase the visibility of algorithmic enumeration within (Theoretical) Computer Science and to contribute to establishing it as an area of \"Algorithms and Complexity\". The seminar brought together researchers within the algorithms community, other fields of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, as well as researchers working on enumeration problems in other application areas, in particular, in Biology. Besides the people already working with enumeration, researchers from other fields of Computer Science were invited. In particular, researchers who  are interested in Parameterized Complexity and different aspects of counting problems were participating in the seminar.  The aim was to accelerate developments and discuss new directions including algorithmic tools and hardness proofs.   \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar collected 44 participants from 13 countries. The participants presented their recent results in 18 invited and contributed talks. Open problems were discussed in several open problem and discussion sessions.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marie-France Sagot, Dieter Kratsch, Henning Fernau, and Petr A.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe multi-disciplinary workshop on Reliable Multiagent Systems\nattracted 26 leading international scholars from different research\nfields, incuding theoretical computer science, engineering multiagent\nsystems, machine learning and ethics in artificial intelligence.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar can  be seen as a first step to establish a new research\nagenda for engineering reliable autonomous systems: clarifying the\nproblem, its properties, and their implications for solutions.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to move towards a true cross-community research agenda  for\naddressing the overarching challenge of engineering reliable\nautonomous systems we have chosen\na slightly different organization than usual: the seminar was\ncomprised of (short) talks (days 1 and 2), and extensive discussions\nand dedicated group work (days 3-5).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe first two days were opened by two longer (45 minutes each)\ntutorials, followed by short \"teaser talks\" (10+5 minutes) related\nto the main topic of <em>reliable multiagent systems</em>. Almost all\nparticipants gave their view of the topic and highlighted possible\ncontributions. The talks were meant to be less \"conference-style\",\nand more inspiring and thought-provoking.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the end of the second day, we  established\nfour working groups to dive deeper into the following questions:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>What <b>(detailed) process</b> can be used to identify properties\nthat a particular reliable autonomous system or MAS needs to satisfy?\n</li><li> How can we engineer reliable autonomous systems that include\n<b>learning</b>?\n</li><li> How can we engineer reliable autonomous systems that include\n<b>human-machine interaction</b> (including human-software\nteamwork)?\n</li><li> How can we engineer reliable autonomous systems comprising\n<b>multiple agents</b> (considering teamwork, collaboration,\ncompetitiveness, swarms, ...)?\n</li></ol> \n <p>The groups met on Wednesday and Thursday for extensive\ndiscussions and reported back intermediate results in plenary\nsessions. Participants were encouraged to move between groups\nto enrich them with their expertise.\nThe seminar concluded on Friday morning with a general discussion where all groups presented their results.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe summarise below the key results from the four discussion groups.\n</p> \n <p><b>Identifying properties:</b> This group discussed the challenge of identifying requirement properties to be verified. It focused in particular on autonomous systems that replace humans in domains that are subject to regulation, since these are most likely to require and benefit from formal verification.\n</p> \n <p> The group articulated the following arguments:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> That autonomous systems be viewed in terms of three layers: a continuous control layer at the bottom, a \"regulatory\" layer in the middle, and an \"ethical\" layer at the top. The distinction between the regulatory and ethical layers are that the former deals with the expected normal behaviour (e.g. following the standard rules of the domain), whereas the latter deals with reasoning in situations where the rules need to be broken. For example, breaking a road rule given appropriate justification.\n</li><li> That for these sorts of systems we can derive verification properties by considering the licencing that is used for humans and how human skills and capabilities are assessed, as well as relevant human capabilities that are assumed, and relevant laws and regulations. The group sketched a high-level process for identifying requirement properties by considering these factors.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe group considered a range of domains, for each one showing how these points would apply.\n</p> \n <p>\nThese ideas were developed into a draft paper during the workshop, and work on this paper has continued subsequently.\n</p> \n <p><b>Learning in reliable autonomous system:</b> The second group was concerned with methods for engineering reliable autonomous systems that involve learning.\n</p> \n <p>      \nThe notion of sufficient reliability varies from domain to domain. For        example, in planning of telecommunication networks there are simulators         that are trusted to be a good model of reality. Hence the simulation         rules could be used for formal verification. In other domains, such as         autonomous driving, there is no established trusted model of reality.\nAssuming a formal model exists and safety properties can be formulated         with temporal logic, there are still remaining challenges: complex         models with a large state space and hybrid continuous and discrete         behavior can make formal verification intractable, especially when the        learned policies are equally complex. On the other hand learning methods         (e.g. reinforcement learning) often \"discover\" key strategies that do not depend on all details of the system. The group discussed ideas for         abstracting/discretizing transition systems based on learned policies.\n</p> \n <p><b>Human-machine interaction in reliable autonomous systems:</b> The third group focused on how to engineer reliable human-agent interaction. \n</p> \n <p>        \nFor that, the first step was to carve out what it means for human-machine communication to be reliable. Values and norms are definitely involved. Drawing from human communication, being truthful, up-to-date with relevant knowledge and honouring commitments are major parts.  Another important building block is transparency: is it always clear, which values are in play, what the agent's purpose is, or what happens with the collected data? The desired result would be reliable outcomes, e.g. through reliably following a protocol, effective communication and getting to a shared understanding.  A number of tools and methods to achieve this were identified: stakeholder analysis, plan patterns/activity diagrams, interaction design patterns, appropriate human training, and explainability (i.e. explainable AI) were among the most prominent engineering solutions. This group also concluded their discussions early and distributed themselves among the other groups after that.\n</p> \n <p><b>Multiple agents in reliable autonomous systems:</b>  The fourth group focussed on the challenges of ensuring reliability in systems comprising multiple, possibly heterogeneous, agents interacting in complex ways. \n</p> \n <p>    \nA number of issues emerged from the discussion, including what does it mean for a multiagent system to be \"collectively reliable\", and what is the relationship between the reliability or otherwise of individual agents and the coordination mechanisms through which they interact, and the collective reliability of the system of a whole.\nThese issues were broken down into more specific engineering challenges, including  which languages should be used to express collective reliability properties (which is closely related to the discussion of the first group) and how such properties should be verified, how to engineer reliable coordination mechanisms when we have only partial access to the states of agents, how to decompose and/or distribute the monitoring and control of individual agents (and associated failure recovery) necessary for reliable coordination, how to do all of the above in systems where agents learn (closely related to the discussion of the second group), and, finally, how to allocate responsibility to individual agents when behaviour is not reliable.\n</p> \n <p>A more detailed research agenda for engineering reliable multiagent systems is in preparation, which we plan to publish as a \"position paper\" in a journal special issue arising from the work at the workshop.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    J\u00fcrgen Dix, Brian Logan, and Michael Winikoff\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAs artificial agents and social robots become more prominent in our lives, they will also increasingly become parts of the groups and teams in which people spend much of their time. The objective of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to explore and discuss theories, methods, and techniques for building embodied social agents (including robots) that can operate in groups as members of a mixed team consisting of humans and agents. Recent advances in AI, and particularly in conversational agents, are likely to lead to an increased placement of agents in groups, covering a variety of application scenarios including healthcare, education, the workplace, and the home. Platforms such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, and new social robots such as Nao, Pepper, and Aibo facilitate such placement. Studies with robots in open-ended environments, including homes and public spaces, also suggest that people often engage with robots in such contexts in groups, rather than just individually. Yet, existing research on human-agent interaction and human-robot interaction so far focuses mostly on one-on-one interactions between a human and a social agent. To stimulate growing research in settings where one or more humans interact with multiple agents or robots, this seminar focused on human-agent communication, interaction, and teamwork in groups. As such, we discussed how agents shape the dynamics of groups, how agents and robots are able to perceive other members of a group and how they relate to each other, and how to move from one-to-one interactions to multi-party interactions of agents and humans in groups and teams. By bringing together researchers from different communities, such as human-robot interaction, multi-agent systems, social psychology, and organizational studies, we aim to generate common ground and new approaches in this interdisciplinary area. While this new domain of inquiry relies on existing research at the intersection between AI, robotics, and the social sciences, our aim is to highlight open questions that current work has not sufficiently addressed.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Elisabeth Andr\u00e9, Ana Paiva, Julie Shah, and Selma \u0160abanovic\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe overall goal of the Dagstuhl Seminar 21381 \"Conversational Agent as Trustworthy Autonomous System\" (Trust-CA) was to bring together researchers and practitioners, who are currently engaged in diverse communities related to Conversational Agents (CA), to explore challenges in maximising the trustworthiness of and trust in conversational agents as AI-driven autonomous systems - an issue deemed increasingly significant given their widespread uses in every sector of life -  and to chart a roadmap for the future conversational agent research.  The three main challenges we identified were:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>\nHow do we develop trustworthy conversational agents?\n</li><li> How do we build people's trust in them?\n</li><li> How do we optimise human and conversational agent collaboration?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe Seminar Trust-CA took place on 19-24 September 2021 in a hybrid mode.  Out of 50 invitees, 19 attended in person and the rest joined online from all over the world, including Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and USA.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe four-day scientific programme started by unpacking the notion of ``trust in conversational agent'' with a panel discussion. Each of the four seminar organisers expressed their views on the notion.  Jonathan Grudin presented a list of ten species of trust that can be applied to conversational agents, for instance, \"Trust that a CA will correctly interpret my question or request; will deliver relevant, reliable, useful information.\"  Asbjorn Folstad first presented an overview of the six themes derived from a pre-Seminar survey (details are in Overview of Working Groups) and then described his recent work on the effect of human likeness of a conversational agent on trust. Bj\u00f6rn Schuller presented factors influencing trust in humans, such as being reliable, ethical, moral and charismatic, and in conversational agents, such as being explainable, interpretable and transparent. He also discussed how to measure trust reliably and the danger of overtrust.  Effie Law discussed the notion of trust with reference to multidisciplinary theory of trust (e.g. psychological, social, historical), beyond the use of questionnaires to evaluate trust, and identifying applications where agents are of high practical value.  Some attendees commented on the ideas shared, e.g., the elusiveness of trust. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe scientific programme comprised two major parts  -  Talks and Breakout Groups.  There were altogether 20 talks, covering a range of topics (see Abstracts).  Nine of the talks were delivered in person and the rest online.  There were six Breakout Groups with each discussing one of the six themes:  Group 1 - Scope of Trust in CA; Group 2  -  Impact of CA; Group 3  -  Ethics of CA; Group 4  -  AI and Technical Development; Group 5  -  Definition, Conceptualisation and Measurement of Trust; Group 6  -  Interaction Design of CA.  Group 1, 3 and 4 had one team each whereas Group 2, 5 and 6 had two teams each. To ease collaboration, individual teams were either in-person or online (except for Group 4 which was in hybrid mode).  Each group had three two-hour working sessions .  In the evening, each group reported progress and invited feedback for shaping subsequent sessions. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe group discussions led to intriguing insights that contributed to addressing the main challenges listed above and stimulated future collaborations (see the Workgroup Reports).  Here we highlight one key insight of each group. Group 1 developed a dynamic model of trust with three stages, Build-Maintain-Repair, which evolve over time.  Group 2 drafted a code of ethics for trustworthy conversational agents with eight provisions. Group 3 explored the ethics challenge of transparency from the perspective of conversational disclosure. Group 4 called for increased collaboration across research communities and industries to strengthen the technological basis for trust in conversational agents. Group 5 proposed a framework for integrating measurement of trusting beliefs and trusting behaviour. Group 6 analysed several aspects of multimodality to understand their possible effects on trust in conversational agents. Apart from the scientific programme, the Seminar organised several social events, including after-dinner wine and cheese gatherings, hiking in a nearby historic site, and a music event.  \n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, our Dagstuhl Seminar Trust-CA was considered a success. The major outputs were derived from the pre-Seminar survey (six research themes and a recommended reading list), twenty talks, and six multi-session breakout groups.  Thanks must go to the enthusiastic involvement of all attendees in analysing various aspects of the burgeoning topic of conversational agents. Of course, the Seminar could only take place with the generosity of <em>Schloss Dagstuhl  -  Leibniz Center for Informatics</em>. The efficiency and friendliness of the scientific and administrative staff of Schloss Dagstuhl was much appreciated by the organisers and all attendees.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Effie Lai-Chong Law, Asbjorn Folstad, Jonathan Grudin , and Bj\u00f6rn Schuller\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAlmost all animals exploit vocal signals for a range of ecologically-motivated purposes. For example, predators may use vocal cues to detect their prey (and vice versa), and a variety of animals (such as birds, frogs, dogs, wolves, foxes, jackals, coyotes, etc.) use vocalisation to mark or defend their territory. Social animals (including human beings) also use vocalisation to express emotions, to establish social relations and to share information, and humans beings have extended this behaviour to a very high level of sophistication through the evolution of speech and language - a phenomenon that appears to be unique in the animal kingdom, but which shares many characteristics with the communication systems of other animals.  \n</p> \n <p>\nAlso, recent years have seen important developments in a range of technologies relating to vocalisation. For example, systems have been created to analyse and playback animals calls, to investigate how vocal signalling might evolve in communicative agents, and to interact with users of spoken language technology (voice-based human-computer interaction using speech technologies such as automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis). Indeed, the latter has witnessed huge commercial success in the past 10-20 years, particularly since the release of <em>Naturally Speaking</em> (Dragon's continuous speech dictation software for a PC) in 1997 and Siri (Apple's voice-operated personal assistant and knowledge navigator for the iPhone) in 2011. Research interest in this area is now beginning to focus on voice-enabling autonomous social agents (such as robots).\n</p> \n <p>\nTherefore, whether it is a bird raising an alarm, a whale calling to potential partners, a dog responding to human commands, a parent reading a story with a child, or a businessperson accessing stock prices using an automated voice service on their mobile phone, vocalisation provides a valuable communications channel through which behaviour may be coordinated and controlled, and information may be distributed and acquired. \n</p> \n <p>\nIndeed, the ubiquity of vocal interaction has given rise to a wealth of research across an extremely diverse array of fields from the behavioural and language sciences to engineering, technology and robotics. This means that there is huge potential for crossfertilisation between the different disciplines involved in the study and exploitation of vocal interactivity. For example, it might be possible to use contemporary advances in machine learning to analyse animal activity in different habitats, or to use robots to investigate contemporary theories of language grounding. Likewise, an understanding of animal vocal behaviour might inform how vocal expressivity might be integrated into the next generation of autonomous social agents. Some of these issues have already been addressed by relevant sub-sections of the research community. However, many opportunities remain unexplored, not least due to the lack of a suitable forum to bring the relevant people together.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur Dagstuhl seminar on the topic of \"Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots (VIHAR)\" provided the unique and timely opportunity to bring together scientists and engineers from a number of different fields to appraise our current level of knowledge. Our broad aim was to focus discussion on the general principles of vocal interactivity as well as evaluating the state-of-the-art in our understanding of vocal interaction within-and-between humans, animals and robots. Some of these sub-topics, such as human spoken language or vocal interactivity between animals, have a long history of scientific research. Others, such as vocal interaction between robots or between robots and animals, are less well studied - mainly due to the relatively recent appearance of the relevant technology. What is interesting is that, independent of whether the sub-topics are well established fields or relatively new research domains, there is an abundance of open research questions which may benefit from a comparative interdisciplinary analysis of the type addressed in this seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Serge Thill and Roger K.

Participants also reviewed existing research methods, such as eye tracking, that may help better understand the impact of language design decisions on programmers. Participants brainstormed a long list of possible research questions for investigation (\u00a74), and then divided into working groups (\u00a75) to focus on several areas of research interest, including novices, context switching and cognitive load, language features, emotional attachment to languages, and representativeness of subjects in studies. In each area, participants proposed research methods and questions that they felt would be valuable to address in the future. Then, the group discussed and prioritized these research questions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar included a discussion of the need for an evidence standard in empirical studies of programming languages, focusing on content of the evidence standard, adoption mechanisms, and criteria for what it might include in our field.

            "data": "\n <p>\nIn this executive summary, we give an overview of computational melody and voice processing and summarize the main topics covered in this seminar. We then describe the background of the seminar's participants, the various activities, and the overall organization. Finally, we reflect on the most important aspects of this seminar and conclude with future implications and acknowledgments.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4029/Teaser_Dagstuhl.png\" width=\"60%\"/> \n <h3>Overview</h3> \n <p>\nWhen asked to describe a specific piece of music, we are often able to sing or hum the main melody. In general terms, a melody may be defined as a linear succession of musical tones expressing a particular musical idea. Because of the special arrangement of tones, a melody is perceived as a coherent entity, which gets stuck in a listener\u2019s head as the most memorable element of a song. As the original Greek term meloid\u00eda (meaning \u201csinging\u201d or \u201cchanting\u201d) implies, a melody is often performed by a human voice. Of course, a melody may also be\nplayed by other instruments such as a violin in a concerto or a saxophone in a jazz piece. Often, the melody constitutes the leading element in a composition, appearing in the foreground, while the accompaniment is in the background. Sometimes melody and accompaniment may even be played on a single instrument such as a guitar or a piano. Depending on the context and research discipline (e. g., music theory, cognition or engineering), one can find different descriptions of what may be meant by a melody. Most people would agree that the\nmelody typically stands out in one way or another. For example, the melody often comprises the higher notes in a musical composition, while the accompaniment consists of the lower notes. Or the melody is played by some instrument with a characteristic timbre. In some performances, the notes of a melody may feature easily discernible time\u2013frequency patterns such as vibrato, tremolo, or glissando. In particular, when considering performed music\ngiven in the form of audio signals, the detection, extraction, separation, and analysis of melodic voices becomes a challenging research area with many yet unsolved problems. In the following, we discuss some MIR tasks related to melody processing, indicating their relevance for fundamental research, commercial applications, and society.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe problem of detecting and separating melodic voices in music recordings is closely related to a research area commonly referred to as <em>source separation</em>. In general, audio signals are complex mixtures of different sound sources. The sound sources can be several people talking simultaneously in a room, different instruments playing together, or a speaker talking in the foreground with music being played in the background. The general goal of source separation is to decompose a complex sound mixture into its constituent components. Source separation methods often rely on specific assumptions such as the availability of multiple channels, where several microphones have been used to record the acoustic scene from different directions. Furthermore, the source signals to be identified are assumed to be independent in a statistical sense.\nIn music, however, such assumptions are not applicable in many cases. For example, musical sound sources may outnumber the available information channels, such as a string quartet recorded in two-channel stereo. Also, sound sources in music are typically highly correlated in time and frequency. Instruments follow the same rhythmic patterns and play notes which are harmonically related. This makes the separation of musical voices from a polyphonic sound mixture an extremely difficult and generally intractable problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhen decomposing a music signal, one strategy is to exploit music-specific properties and additional musical knowledge. In music, a source might correspond to a melody, a bass line, a drum track, or a general instrumental voice. The separation of the melodic voice, for example, may be simplified by exploiting the fact that the melody is often the leading voice, characterized by its dominant dynamics and by its temporal continuity. The track of a bass guitar may be extracted by explicitly looking at the lower part of the frequency spectrum. A human singing voice can often be distinguished from other musical sources due to characteristic time--frequency patterns such as vibrato.\nBesides such acoustic cues, score-informed source separation strategies make use of the availability of score representations to support the separation process. The score provides valuable information in two respects. On the one hand, pitch and timing of note events provide rough guidance within the separation process. On the other hand, the score offers a natural way to specify the target sources to be separated.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this seminar, we discussed source separation techniques that are particularly suited for melodic voices. To get a better understanding of the problem, we approached source separation from different directions including model-based approaches that explicitly exploit acoustic and musical assumptions as well as data-driven machine learning approaches.\n</p> \n <p>\nGiven a music recording, melody extraction is often understood in the MIR field as the task of extracting a trajectory of frequency values that correspond to the pitch sequence of the dominant melodic voice. As said before, melody extraction and source separation are highly related: while melody extraction is much easier if the melodic source can be isolated first, the source separation process can be guided if the melodic pitch sequence is given a priori. However, both tasks have different goals and involve different challenges. The desired output of melody extraction is a trajectory of frequency values, which is often sufficient information for retrieval applications (e.,g., query-by-humming or the search of a musical theme) and performance analysis. In contrast, for music editing and audio enhancement applications, source separation techniques are usually needed.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the seminar, we addressed different problems that are related to melody extraction. For example, the melody is often performed by a solo instrument, which leads to a problem also known as <em>solo-accompaniment separation</em>. The estimation of the fundamental frequency of a quasi-periodic signal, termed <em>mono-pitch estimation</em>, is a long-studied problem with applications in speech processing. While mono-pitch estimation is now achievable with reasonably high accuracy, the problem of <em>multi-pitch estimation</em> with the objective of estimating the fundamental frequencies of concurrent periodic sounds remains very challenging. This particularly holds for music signals, where concurrent notes stand in close harmonic relation. For extreme cases such as complex orchestral music where one has a high level of polyphony, multi-pitch estimation becomes intractable with today's methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nMelodic voices are often performed by singers, and the singing voice is of particular importance in music. Humans use singing to create an identity, express their emotions, tell stories, exercise creativity, and connect while singing together. Because of its social, cultural, and educational impact, singing plays a central role in many parts of our lives, it has a positive effect on our health, and it creates a link between people, disciplines, and domains (e.g., music and language). Many people are active in choirs, and vocal music makes up an important part of our cultural heritage. In particular in Asian countries, karaoke has become a major cultural force performed by people of all age groups. Singing robots, vocaloids, or synthesizers such as Hatsune Miku (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku</a>) have made their way into the mass market in Japan.\nThanks to digitization and technologies, the world wide web has become an important tool for amateur and professional singers to discover and study music, share their performances, get feedback, and engage with their audiences. An ever-increasing amount of music-related information is available to singers and singing enthusiasts, such as music scores (For example, the Choral Public Domain Library currently hosts free scores of at least 24963 choral and vocal works by at least 2820 composers, see \n<a href=\"http://www.cpdl.org/\">http://www.cpdl.org/</a>) as well as audio and video recordings. Finally, music archives contain an increasing number of digitized audio collections of historic value from all around the world such as Flamenco music, Indian art music, Georgian vocal music, or Bejing Opera performances.\n</p> \n <p>\nDue to its importance, we placed in our seminar a special emphasis on music technologies related to singing. This involves different research areas including singing analysis, description, and modeling (timbre, intonation, expression), singing voice synthesis and transformation, voice isolation/separation, and singing performance rating. Such research areas require a deep understanding of the way people produce and perceive vocal sounds. In our seminar, we discussed such issues with researchers having a background in singing acoustics and music performance.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the last years, as is also the case for other multimedia domains, many advances in music and audio processing have benefited from new developments in machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>In particular, deep neural networks (DNNs) have found their way into MIR and are applied with increasing success to various MIR tasks including pitch estimation, melody extraction, sound source separation, and singing voice synthesis.\nThe complex spectro-temporal patterns and relations found in music signals make this domain a challenging testbed for such new machine learning techniques. Music is different from many other types of multimedia. In a static image, for example, objects may occlude one another with the result that only certain parts are visible. In music, however, concurrent musical events may superimpose or blend each other in a more complicated way. Furthermore, as opposed to static images, music depends on time. Music is organized in a hierarchical way ranging from notes, bars, and motifs, to entire sections. As a result, one requires models that capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in music.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the seminar, we looked at the new research challenges that arise when designing music-oriented DNN architectures. Furthermore, considering the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of collecting human annotations of musical events and attributes (e.g., timbre, intonation, expression) in audio recordings, we addressed the issue of gathering large-scale annotated datasets that are needed for DNN-based approaches.\n</p> \n <h3>Participants and Group Composition</h3> \n <p>In our seminar, we had 32 participants, who came from various locations around the world including North America (4 participants from the U.S.), Asia (4 participants from Japan, 2 from Taiwan, 2 from Singapore, 1 from Korea, 1 from India), and Europe (18 participants from France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom).\nMore than half of the participants came to Dagstuhl for the first time and expressed enthusiasm about the open and retreat-like atmosphere. Besides its international character, the seminar was also highly interdisciplinary. While most of the participating researchers are working in the field of music information retrieval, we also had participants with a background in musicology, acoustics, machine learning, signal processing, and other fields. By having experts working in technical as well as in non-technical disciplines, our seminar stimulated cross-disciplinary discussions, while highlighting opportunities for new collaborations among our attendees. Most of the participants had a strong musical background, some of them even having a dual career in an engineering discipline and music. This led to numerous social activities including singing and playing music together.\nIn addition to geographical locations and research disciplines, we tried to foster variety in terms of seniority levels and presence of female researchers.\nIn our seminar, 10 of the 32 participants were female, including three key researchers (Anja Volk, Emilia G\u00f3mez, and Johanna Devaney) from the \"Women in Music Information Retrieval\" WiMIR) initiative.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, by gathering internationally renowned scientists as well as younger promising researchers from different research areas, our seminar allowed us to gain a better understanding of the problems that arise when dealing with a highly interdisciplinary topic such as melody and voice processing--problems that cannot be addressed by simply using established research in signal processing or machine learning.\n</p> \n <h3>Overall Organization and Schedule</h3> \n <p>\nDagstuhl seminars are known for having a high degree of flexibility and interactivity, which allows participants to discuss ideas and to raise questions rather than to present research results. Following this tradition, we fixed the schedule during the seminar asking for spontaneous contributions with future-oriented content, thus avoiding a conference-like atmosphere, where the focus tends to be on past research achievements.\nAfter the organizers gave an overview of the Dagstuhl concept and the seminar's overall topic, we started the first day with self-introductions, where all participants introduced themselves and expressed their expectations and wishes for the seminar. We then continued with a small number of short (15 to 20 minutes) stimulus talks, where specific participants were asked to address some critical questions on melody and voice processing in a nontechnical fashion. Each of these talks seamlessly moved towards an open discussion among all participants, where the respective presenters took over the role of a moderator. These discussions were well received and often lasted for more than half an hour. The first day closed with a brainstorming session on central topics covering the participants' interests while shaping the overall schedule and format for the next day.\nOn the subsequent days, we continued having stimulus tasks interleaved with extensive discussions. Furthermore, we split into smaller groups, each group discussing a more specific topic in greater depth. The results and conclusions of these parallel group sessions, which lasted between 60 to 90 minutes, were then presented and discussed with the plenum. This mixture of presentation elements gave all participants the opportunity for presenting their ideas while avoiding a monotonous conference-like presentation format. On the last day, the seminar concluded with a session we called \"self-outroductions\" where each participant presented his or her personal view on the seminar's results.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdditionally to the regular scientific program, we had several additional activities. First, we had a demo session on Thursday evening, where participants presented user interfaces, available datasets, and audio examples of synthesized singing voices. One particular highlight was the incorporation of singing practice in the seminar. In particular, we carried out a recording session on Wednesday afternoon, where we recorded solo and polyphonic singing performed by Dagstuhl participants. The goal of this recording session was to contribute to existing open datasets in the area of music processing.\nThe singers were recorded with different microphone types such as throat and headset microphones to obtain clean recordings of the individual voices. All participants agreed that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3956666\">the recorded dataset</a> should be made publicly available for research purposes. As preparation for these recordings, we assembled a choir consisting of ten to twelve amateur singers  (all Dagstuhl participants) covering different voice sections (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). In the lunch breaks and the evening hours, the group met for regular rehearsals to practice different four-part choral pieces. These musical activities throughout the entire week not only supported the theoretical aspects of the seminar but also had a very positive influence on the group dynamics. Besides the recordings, we also had a concert on Thursday evening, where various participant-based ensembles performed a variety of music including classical music and folk songs.\n</p> <h3>Conclusions and Acknowledgment</h3> \n <p>\nHaving a Dagstuhl seminar, we gathered researchers from different fields including information retrieval, signal processing, musicology, and acoustics. This allowed us to approach the problem of melody and voice processing by looking at a broad spectrum of data analysis techniques (including signal processing, machine learning, probabilistic models, user studies), by considering different domains (including text, symbolic, image, audio representations), and by drawing inspiration from the creative perspectives of the agents (composer, performer, listener) involved. As a key result of this seminar, we achieved some substantial progress towards understanding, modeling, representing, and extracting melody- and voice-related information using computational means.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar gave us the opportunity for having interdisciplinary discussions in an inspiring and retreat-like atmosphere. The generation of novel, technically oriented scientific contributions was not the main focus of the seminar. Naturally, many of the contributions and discussions were on a conceptual level, laying the foundations for future projects and collaborations. Thus, the main impact of the seminar is likely to take place in the medium and long term. Some more immediate results, such as plans to share research data and software, also arose from the discussions. In particular, we plan to make the dataset recorded during the Dagstuhl seminar available to the research community. As further measurable outputs from the seminar, we expect to see several joint papers and applications for funding.\n</p> \n <p>\nBeside the scientific aspect, the social aspect of our seminar was just as important. We had an interdisciplinary, international, and very interactive group of researchers, consisting of leaders and future leaders in our field. Many of our participants were visiting Dagstuhl for the first time and enthusiastically praised the open and inspiring setting. The group dynamics were excellent with many personal exchanges and common activities. Some scientists expressed their appreciation for\nhaving the opportunity for prolonged discussions with researchers from neighboring research fields--something that is often impossible during conference-like events.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, our expectations for the seminar were not only met but exceeded, in particular concerning networking and community building. We want to express our gratitude to the Dagstuhl board for giving us the opportunity to organize this seminar, the Dagstuhl office for their exceptional support in the organization process, and the entire Dagstuhl staff for their excellent service during the seminar. In particular, we want to thank Susanne Bach-Bernhard, Annette Beyer, Michael Gerke, and Michael Wagner for their assistance during the preparation and organization of the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Meinard M\u00fcller, Emilia G\u00f3mez, and Yi-Hsuan Yang\n                </div> \n",

Nowadays, performing floating-point computations is supported on a wide range of computing platforms, and are employed in many widely-used and important software systems, such as high-performance computing simulations, banking, stock exchange, self-driving cars, and machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, writing correct, and yet high-performance and energy-efficient, floating-point code is challenging. For example, floating-point operations are often non-associative (contrary to their real mathematical equivalents), which creates problems when an ordering of operations is modified by either a compiler or due to nondeterministic interleavings of concurrent executions. Furthermore, the underlying floating-point hardware is often heterogeneous, hence different results may be computed across different platforms or even across components of the same heterogeneous platform. Given the underlying complexity associated with writing floating-point code, it is not surprising that there have been numerous software bugs attributed to incorrectly implemented floating-point computations.\n</p> \n <p> Research related to floating-point computation spans a multitude of areas of computer science, ranging from hardware design and architecture, all the way to high-performance computing, machine learning, and software analysis and verification. The objective of this seminar was thus to bring together researchers from several of these areas, which have either traditionally been considered as non-overlapping, or which have arguably enjoyed insufficient interaction despite a clear overlap of interests. The goal in mind here was to\nprovide opportunities to brainstorm new theoretical advances and practical techniques and tools for making floating-point computations performant and correct, and to help foster long term collaborations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar involved brief presentations from most participants, interspersed with a lot of informal technical discussion, in addition to four breakout sessions based on common themes that arose during informal discussion. In addition, a joint panel session was held between this seminar and the concurrently running \u201cMachine Learning and Formal Methods\u201d seminar.\nThis report presents the collection of abstracts associated with the participant presentations, notes summarising each discussion session, and a transcript of the panel session. We hope that the report will provide a useful resource for researchers today who are interested in understanding the state-of-the-art and open problems related to analysing and synthesising floating-point programs, and as a historical resource helping to clarify the status of this field in 2017.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Eva Darulova, Alastair F.

Virtually all modern security solutions rely on cryptography.\n</p> \n <p>\nSymmetric cryptography deals with the case that both the sender and the receiver of a message are using the same key. This differentiates symmetric cryptography from its asymmetric counterpart, where senders or verifiers use a \"public key\" and receivers or signers use a corresponding but different \"private key\". As asymmetric primitives are typically orders of magnitude less efficient than symmetric cryptographic schemes, symmetric cryptosystems remain the main workhorses of cryptography and highly relevant not only for academia, but also for industrial research and applications. While great progress has been made in designing and analyzing ciphers, fundamental aspects of these ciphers are still not fully understood. Moreover, as we have learned from the Snowden revelations, cryptography in general and symmetric cryptography in particular faces new fascinating challenges.\n</p> \n <h3>Current Topics and Challenges</h3> \n <p>\nWe identified the following three areas as among the most important topics for future research.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Cryptography for the IoT.</b> Motivated by the upcoming IoT, one of the strong research trends in symmetric cryptography is about lightweight cryptography. Here, lightweight cryptography refers to strong cryptography, that can be executed on heavily resource constrained devices. Those efforts resulted in a wide variety of block cipher designs suitable for IoT applications.\nFor instance, PRESENT designed in 2007 is one of the early designs with strong implementation advantages on hardware, and there have been other innovative follow-up block cipher designs. Some of them are standardized as the international standard, and used in thousands of devices in our daily lives.\nHowever, a block cipher is not the solution to all cryptographic purposes. For instance, to encrypt a certain amount of data, the block cipher has to be integrated into a suitable mode of operation. In most practical use cases, confidentiality is not the only concern, as many scenarios require data authenticity as well. Here a message authentication code (MAC) can be used to ensure authenticity. Authenticated encryption (AE) is used for protecting both confidentiality and authenticity.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe first MAC, called Chaskey, that specifically targets applications for lightweight cryptography was proposed only recently in 2014. The CAESAR project, an international competition for AE initiated at Dagstuhl, attracted several submissions that were designed for the purposes for lightweight cryptography. There is also a recent attempt to design a lightweight tweakable block cipher, an advanced primitive of a block cipher that allows more flexible usage, which can be efficiently integrated into highly secure encryption and/or authentication mechanisms. However, this research just started and many primitives and modes of operations suitable for lightweight crypto remain to be explored.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Statistical Attacks.</b> Statistical attacks have been deployed widely and providing strong resistance against them has resulted in several important design criteria for contemporary symmetric primitives.\nThe first type of statistical attacks that is applicable to a large set of block ciphers is differential cryptanalysis, introduced by Biham and Shamir. Since its invention in the early nineties several variants, tweaks and generalizations have been proposed and applied to many block ciphers.\nThe second generally applicable attack on block ciphers is Matsui's linear cryptanalysis. \nSimilarly to differential attacks, since its introduction, many extensions and improvements have been made.\nOne main issue that has become apparent only recently is the accuracy of the underlying statistical models that researchers are using. Typically, those models are presented under some simplifying assumptions, whose validity remains an open question.\nIt is an important challenge to settle these unsatisfactory simplifications. This becomes even more important when the attacks are hard or impossible to verify experimentally due to the large computational costs involved. Moreover, to allow comparison between different attacks the researchers must agree on common attack models and parameters that measure the performance of the attack.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Symmetric Cryptography and Real-World Needs.</b> The symmetric cryptography community has many very talented people and the state of the area has moved from it infancy in the seventies to a mature field today. However, we should ensure that the world's population does benefit of this progress. In particular, the Snowden leaks have painfully illustrated that citizen privacy and anonymity is next to non-existent nowadays. Secret services and IT corporations massively spy on people's communication and data storage for motives such as profit and surveillance. They don't seem to be hindered significantly in this at all by the pervasive deployment of cryptography (TLS, GSM, WPA, etc.). Cynically, monopolistic corporations like Google use encryption to protect the data of their users from prying eyes of other players such as network providers. It appears that much of the cryptography deployed today is there to protect the powers that be rather than protect human rights. With the roll-out of smart grid and internet-of-things surveillance will become quasi universal with all imaginable devices reporting on our behavior to big corporations. This situation has been addressed in several invited talks by Bart Preneel and Adi Shamir and they rightfully say that we as a cryptographic community should attempt to improve this. Along the same lines, Phil Rogaway gave a highly acclaimed invited talk at Asiacrypt 2015 on the moral aspects on cryptographic research. He invites us to do some introspection and ask the question: are we doing the right thing?\n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe these questions are important also for the symmetric crypto community. While the problem is certainly not restricted to symmetric cryptography and probably cannot be solved by symmetric cryptography alone, we should consider it our moral duty to improve the situation.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>The seminar program consists of presentations about the above topics, and relevant areas of symmetric cryptography, including new cryptanalytic techniques and new designs. Furthermore, there were discussion sessions. In \"Discussion on CAESAR with focus on robustness\", we discussed about the meaning and relevance of the term robustness in general and for the CAESAR competition in particular. In \"Discussion on Mass Surveillance\", a number of questions related to the real-world relevance of the symmetric crypto community and its research were discussed. For both discussions we provide summery of the questions and results.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Joan Daemen, Tetsu Iwata, Nils Gregor Leander, and Kaisa Nyberg\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Bringing Graph Databases and Network Visualization Together",
            "data": "\n <p>\nNetwork analytics through interactive network visualization has been essential in many research and application areas, such as bioinformatics, biomedicine, cyber security, e-commerce, social science, and software engineering. A network is often supported by graph databases with advanced query engines and indexing techniques. Graph databases have substantial contributions by academia and gained strong momentum in the industry, where the focus is on scalable systems using graph query languages that require to be learned by users. Even though the Graph Database and Network Visualization communities study the same object, a graph/network, albeit from different perspectives, they do not communicate with each other. By bringing both communities together, we aimed to initiate and foster mutual communication and joint work. The goal of this seminar was to initiate collaborative efforts, to increase the mutual awareness of each others' existing concepts and technologies, and to identify new and complementary research challenges that lead to novel scientific outcomes. We have developed the schedule for the seminar based on our experience from previous successful Dagstuhl Seminars with a balance between prepared talks, plenary discussions, and breakout groups for less structured discussions focused on a selection of highly relevant topics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers envisioned several core topics for discussion at the Dagstuhl Seminar, as outlined in the proposal:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Integration of fundamental concepts used in the two communities\n</li><li>Visual scalability and computational performance\n</li><li> Visual graph query paradigm\n</li><li> Responsive visualization of graph query results\n</li><li> (Qualitative) Evaluation\n</li><li> Domain-oriented applications\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nDuring the plenary discussions on the first day, the participants identified several more specific topics for the work in separate working groups, which lead to the following working group titles: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Evaluation and Usefulness\n</li><li> Understanding gaps and opportunities between Graph Databases and Network Visualization\n</li><li> Visual querying and result visualization\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nOur aim was to have focused discussions on these topics in which we would be able to make significant progress during the seminar, in order to shape a position paper and to lay the foundations for subsequent collaborations. The discussions showed that there indeed is the need for a closer exchange between the communities in order to improve the mutual understanding and practical solutions, but also to identify research questions that can be tackled jointly. They however also showed the great potential in this exchange and the large interest in both communities for joint work.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe have organized the seminar during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to various regulations and travel restrictions, only roughly half of the usual number of participants attended in person. The meeting was held purely on-site, with the exception of one participant connecting in via video conferencing. We thank Dagstuhl for equipping the seminar rooms with suitable infrastructure  and for putting suitable health and safety regulations in place to create a smooth experience and safe environment for all participants.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>\nWe would like to thank all participants of the seminar for their contributions and lively discussions, and the scientific directorate of Dagstuhl for providing us with the opportunity to organize this seminar. Finally, the seminar would not have been possible without the amazing support by the staff of Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Karsten Klein, Juan F.

            "title": "Specification Formalisms for Modern Cyber-Physical Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nModern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) represent the convergence of the\nfields of control theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning,\nand distributed communication/coordination. CPS applications range\nfrom small quad-rotor based aerial vehicles to commercial airplanes,\nfrom driverless autonomous vehicles to vehicle platoons, from\nnano-scale medical devices in closed-loop with a human to giga-scale\nindustrial manufacturing systems.  While several application domains\ncan claim to be cyber-physical systems, a unique aspect of CPS is a\nstrong focus on model-based development (MBD). The MBD paradigm allows\nanalyzing the system virtually, examining its safety, performance,\nstability, security, privacy, or resilience.  At a certain level of\nabstraction, a model of a CPS application can be roughly divided into\nthree parts: (1) the plant model representing an encapsulation of the\nphysical components in the system, (2) the controller model\nrepresenting the software used to regulate the plant, and (3) an\nenvironment model representing exogenous disturbances to the plant. \n</p> \n <p>\nGiven plant, controller and environment models of a system, in order\nto perform any of the aforementioned analyses, a crucial step is to\narticulate the goal of the analysis as a formal specification for the\nsystem.  The analysis problem can then check whether the system\nimplementation is a refinement of its specification. However, the\nstate-of-the-art in industrial settings is that formal specifications\nare rarely found. Specifications exist in the form of mental models of\ncorrectness formed by engineers through their design insights and\nexperience, or visual depictions in the form of simulation plots, and\noccasionally as legacy scripts and monitors. None of these are formal,\nmachine-checkable unambiguous specifications. In the industry,\nengineers often use the term requirements instead of specifications.\nTypical industrial requirements do not arise from principled software\nengineering approaches to develop CPS software, but rather are\nsummaries of discussions between developers and their customers.\nWhile the state-of-the-art for requirements/specifications in\nindustrial settings is far from ideal, in academic settings, there is\na problem of having a wide choice between a number of specification\nformalisms, primarily being developed by the formal methods community.\nOn the other hand, application-specific academic domains such as\nrobotics, biological systems, and medical devices may not always\narticulate formal system specifications.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe overarching goal of the seminar was thus to address the following\nquestion: <em>Is there a universal specification formalism that can be used as a standard language for a variety of modern cyber-physical systems?</em>  To address this question, this seminar was divided into three broad thrusts:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>State-of-the-art in general specification formalisms,\n</li><li>Domain-specific needs and domain-specific specification formalisms,\n</li><li>Expressivity, Monitoring Algorithms and Analysis concerns for a \tspecification language.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Outcome of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar had a total of 37 participants with a mix of research communities including experts (both theoreticians and practitioners)\nin formal methods, runtime monitoring, machine learning, control\ntheorey, industrial IoT, and biological systems.  The seminar focused\non the cross-domain challenges in the development of a universal\nspecification formalism that can accommodate for various CPS\napplications. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar provided an excellent overview of requirements from\nvarious application domains that paved the road for identifying common\nfeatures in a cross-domain specification language. As another outcome\nof the seminar, we defined as a community the following next steps:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Identification of various benchmark problems for monitoring \tspecifications at runtime, and learning specifications from data.\n</li><li>Standardizing syntax for expressing time-series data, such as comma \tseparated values (CSV) with a well-defined header file. \n</li><li>Creating a public repository containing traces, specifications, models, and\npattern libraries.\n</li><li>Coordination with RVComp, a runtime verification competition \tcollocated with the Runtime Verification (RV) conference, and possible \tcoordination with SygusComp (Syntax-guided synthesis competition) and \tSYNTComp (Synthesis competition) to arrange special tracks on learning \tspecifications.\n</li><li>Creating a public repository containing standard parsers for variety of\nspecification formalisms such as variants of Signal Temporal Logic.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Sessions</h3> \n <p>The seminar was organized as a sequence of open discussions on pre-defined topics of interest. \nEach session had one or two moderators who introduced the topic and one or two scribes \nwho recorded the proceedings of the discussions. The moderators had a short introduction of \nthe topic, identifying the most important sub-topics for open discussion. The discussions were \nstructured in following sessions:\n</p> \n <p><b>Day 1</b> State-of-the-art in general specification formalisms</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Specification languages in digital hardware\n</li><li>Tools perspective\n</li><li> Overview of declarative specification languages\n</li></ol> \n <p>\n<b>Days 2 and 3</b> Domain-specific needs and domain-specific specification formalisms\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Specifications in automotive systems\n</li><li> Specifications in robotics and perception\n</li><li> Specifications in Industry 4.0, EDA and mixed signal design\n</li><li> Specifications in smart cities\n</li><li> Specifications in bioloty\n</li><li> Specifications in medical devices\n</li><li> Specifications in security\n</li></ol> \n <p><b>Days 4</b> Expressivity, monitoring algorithms and analysis concerns</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Algorithms for specifications: specifications for learning <em>versus</em> learning specifications\n</li><li>Streaming languages\n</li><li> Runtime monitoring\n</li><li> Expressivity\n</li></ol> \n <p><b>Day 5</b> Next steps and summary of the seminar outcomes</p> \n <p>We also organized on Day 1 a session to honor the memory of Oded\nMaler, one of the co-organizers of this seminar, and who sadly passed\naway in September 2018. </p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jyotirmoy Deshmukh and Dejan Nickovic\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Transparency by Design",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAs AI technologies are witnessing impressive advances and becoming increasingly widely adopted in real-world domains, the debate around the ethical implications of AI has gained significant momentum over the last few years. Much of this debate has focused on fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics, giving rise to \"Fairness, Accountability and Transparency\" (FAT or FAccT) being commonly used to capture this complex of properties as key elements to ethical AI. \n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, the notion of transparency -  closely linked to terms like explainability, accountability, and interpretability - has not yet been given a holistic treatment within computer science. Despite the fact that it is a prerequisite to instilling trust in AI technologies, there is a gap in understanding around how to create systems with the required transparency, from demands on capturing their transparency requirements all the way through to concrete design and implementation methodologies. When it comes to, for example, demonstrating that a system is fair or accountable, we lack usable theoretical frameworks for transparency. More generally, there are no general practical methodologies for the design of transparent systems. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to initiate a debate around theoretical foundations and practical methodologies with the overall aim of laying the foundations for a \"Transparency by Design\" framework, i.e. a framework for systems development that integrates transparency in all stages of the software development process. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo address this challenge, we brought together researchers with expertise in Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Engineering, but also considered it essential to invite experts from the humanities, law and social sciences, which would bring an interdisciplinary dimension to the seminar to investigate the cognitive, social, and legal aspects of transparency.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the seminar had to be carried out in a virtual, online format. To accommodate the time zones of participants from different parts of the world, \ntwo three-hour sessions were scheduled each day, with participant groups of roughly equal size re-shuffled each day to provide every attendee with opportunities to interact with all other participants whenever time difference between their locations made this possible in principle. Each session consisted of plenary talks and discussion as well as work in small groups, with discussions and outcomes captured in shared documents that were edited jointly by the groups attending different sessions each day. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was planned to gradually progress from building a shared understanding of the problem space among participants on the first day, to mapping out the state of the art and identifying gaps in their respective areas of expertise on the second day and third day. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo do this, the groups identified questions that stakeholders in different domains may need to be able to answer in a transparent systems, where we relied on participants to choose domains they are familiar with and consider important. To identify the state of the art in these areas, the group sessions on the second and third days were devoted to mapping out the current practice and research, identifying gaps that need to be addressed. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe two sessions on each day  considered these in terms of four aspects: data collection techniques, software development methodologies, AI techniques and user interfaces. \n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, the last day was dedicated to consolidating the results towards creating a framework for designing transparent systems. This began with each of the parallel groups considering different aspects:  Motivating why transparency is important; challenges posed by current algorithmic systems; transparency-enhancing technologies; a transparency by design methodology; and, finally, the road ahead. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe work that began with the small group discussions and summaries  continued with follow up meetings to continue the work of each group. The organisers have led the work to integrate all of these into an ongoing effort after the seminar, aiming to create a future joint publication.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Judy Kay, Tsvi Kuflik, and Michael Rovatsos\n                </div> \n",

It can be used for improvement of both functional and non-functional properties of software. Much of the early success came from the field of automated program repair. However, GI has also been successfully used to optimise for efficiency, energy and memory consumption as well as automated transplantation of a piece of functionality from one program to another. These results are impressive especially given that genetic improvement only arose as a separate research area in the last few years. Thus the time was ripe to organise a seminar that would gather researchers from GI and related areas together to summarise the current achievements and identify avenues for further research.\n</p> \n <p> The seminar attracted researchers from various GI-related software engineering areas, ranging from automated software repair through genetic programming and software testing to biological and evolutionary computation. The talks covered the latest research and speculations on future research both in the practical applications of genetic improvement, such as energy consumption optimisation and automated parallelisation, to initial results\non much lacking GI theory. In particular, GI theory and indeed software in general were discussed in terms of search landscape analysis. Other talks covered software testing and bug repair. The participants also identified a set of benchmarks and tools for GI. These have been published at the geneticimprovementofsofware.com website to allow other researchers to compare their new technologies against the state-of-the-art. \n</p> \n <p>The seven breakout groups' topics ranged from re-evaluating the basic components of the GI framework, such as fitness functions and traversing the GI search space, to identifying issues related to adoption of GI in industry. One of the issues has been explanation of the automatically generated changes, which might be a roadblock in applying them in the real-world, especially safety-critical, software.\n</p> \n <p> The seminar has already led to a few publications. For example, four papers accepted to the 4th International Genetic Improvement Workshop (GI-2018)1, co-located with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), were written by one or more workshop participants. Indeed most were started in Dagstuhl. Several other collaborations have been established, with plans for visits and further research on topics identified at the seminar. We look forward to results of this work initiated at Dagstuhl.\n</p> \n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nGenetic improvement (GI) uses automated search to find improved versions of existing software [6, 8]. It uses optimisation, machine learning techniques, particularly search based software engineering techniques such as genetic programming [2, 1, 9]. to improve existing software. The improved program need not behave identically to the original. For example, automatic bug fixing improves program code by reducing or eliminating buggy behaviour,\nwhilst automatic transplantation adds new functionality derived from elsewhere. In other cases the improved software should behave identically to the old version but is better because, for example: it runs faster, it uses less memory, it uses less energy or it runs on a different type of computer.\n</p> \n <p>\nGI differs from, for example, formal program translation, in that it primarily verifies the behaviour of the new mutant version by running both the new and the old software on test inputs and comparing their output and performance in order to see if the new software can still do what is wanted of the original program and is now better. Using less constrained search allows not only functional improvements but also each search step is typically far cheaper, allowing GI to scale to substantial programs. Genetic improvement can be used\nto create large numbers of versions of programs, each tailored to be better for a particular use or for a particular computer, or indeed (e.g. to defeat the authors of computer viruses) simply to be different. Other cases where software need to be changed include porting to new environments (e.g. parallel computing [3] mobile devices) or for code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering [7].\n</p> \n <p>\nGenetic improvement can by used with multi-objective optimisation to consider improving software along multiple dimensions or to consider trade-offs between several objectives, such as asking GI to evolve programs which trade speed against the quality of answers they give. Of course, it may be possible to find programs which are both faster and give better answers. Mostly Genetic Improvement makes typically small changes or edits (also known as mutations) to the program\u2019s source code, but sometimes the mutations are made to assembly\ncode, byte code or binary machine code.\n</p> \n <p> GI arose as a separate field of research only in the last few years. Even though it\u2019s origins could be traced back to the work by Ryan &amp; Walsh [18] in 1995, it is the work by Arcuri [10] and White [20] that led to the development and wider uptake of the GI techniques. The novelty lay in applying heuristics to search for code mutations that improved existing software. Both Arcuri and White applied genetic programming (GP), with Arcuri using also hill-climbing and random search on a small set of problems. Rather than trying to evolve a program from scratch, as in traditional GP, Arcuri and White took the approach of seeding [5] the initial population with copies of the original program. Next, instead of focusing on evolving a program fulfilling a particular task, as has been done before, Arcuri and White used GP to improve their programs either to fix existing bugs or to improve the non-functional properties of software, in particular, its efficiency and energy consumption.\nBoth Arcuri and White, however, applied their, now known as, GI techniques, to relatively small benchmarks having little resemblance to large scale real-world problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe bug fixing approach was taken up by Forrest, Le Goues and Weimer et al. [12, 15, 19] and adapted for large software systems. One of the insights that allowed for this adoption was an observation that full program variants need not be evolved, yet only a sequence of edits, which are then applied to the original program. Validity of the resultant modified software was then evaluated on a set of test cases, assumed to capture desired program\nbehaviour, as in previous work. This strand of research led to the development of first GP-based automated software repair tool called GenProg [15]. Success of this automated bug fixing work led to several best paper awards and two \u2018Humie\u2019 awards (international prizes for human-competitive results produced by genetic and evolutionary computation http://www.human-competitive.org/) and inspired work on other automated software repair tools, including Angelix [16], which uses a form of constraint solving to synthesise bug fixes.\n</p> \n <p>\nResearch on improvement of non-functional software properties has yet to garner the attention and software development effort as the work on automated bug fixing. Langdon et al. [3, 13, 14] published several articles on efficiency improvement and parallelisation using GI. They were able to improve efficiency of large pieces of state-of-the-art software Moreover, the genetically improved version of a bioinformatics software called BarraCUDA is the first instance of a genetically improved piece of software adapted into development [14, 4].\n</p> \n <p>\nPetke et al. [17] set themselves a challenge of improving efficiency of a highly-optimised piece of software that has been improved by expert human developers over a period of several years. In particular, a famous Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver was chosen, called MiniSAT. It implements the core technologies of SAT solving and inspired a MiniSAT-hack track at the annual international SAT solver competitions, where anyone can submit their own version of MiniSAT. Petke et al. showed that further efficiency improvements can be made by using this source of genetic material for the GP process and specializing the solver for a particular downstream application. This work showed the initial potential of what is now called automated software transplantation and was awarded a Silver \u2018Humie\u2019. Further work on automated software transplantation won an ACM SIGSOFT distinguished paper\naward and a Gold \u2018Humie\u2019 at this year\u2019s Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2017) [11].\n</p> \n <h3>Aims of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar brought together researchers in this new field of software engineering to investigate what is achievable with current technology and the current impediments to progress (if indeed there are any) of what can be achieved within the field in the future and how GI can affect the software development process. \n</p> \n <p>\nWith the growing popularity of the field, multiple awards and fast progress GI research in the field, it is the right time to gather top the academics in GI and related fields to push the boundaries of what genetic improvement can achieve even further. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought researchers working in genetic improvement and related areas, such as automated program repair, software testing and genetic programming, together. It summarized achievements in automated software optimisation. We will use this summary as a basis to investigate how optimisation approaches from the different fields represented at the seminar can be combined to produce a robust industry-ready set of techniques for\nsoftware improvement.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Wolfgang Banzhaf, Peter Nordin, Robert E.

            "data": "\n <p>\nOne-dimensional structures embedded in higher-dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in both the natural and artificial worlds: examples include DNA strands, migration paths, planetary orbits, rocket trajectories, robot motion planning, chip design, and many more.  These are studied in different areas of mathematics and computer science, under many names: knots, curves, paths, traces, trajectories, graphs, and others.  However, researchers in many areas are just beginning to apply algorithmic techniques to find efficient algorithms for these structures, especially when more fundamental mathematical results are required.  Broad examples of such problems include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>classical algorithms on trajectories like the Fr\u00e9chet distance as a way to formalize a distance measure as a curve changes; \n</li><li> morphing between two versions of a common graph, which again tracks a higher dimensional space that corresponds to movement of a one-dimensional object; \n</li><li> drawing and manipulating objects in three-manifolds, such as graphs, curves, or surfaces; and \n</li><li> perhaps the simplest problem posed (in different ways) in all these areas, \"how does one draw and morph a nice curve on a nice surface?\"\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThis seminar was the second in a series.  In the first seminar, the goal was to identify connections and seed new research collaborations along the spectrum from knot theory and topology, through to computational topology and computational geometry, and all the way to graph drawing. After the success of the first seminar, the goal for this second round was to continue and extend prior work, in particular by focussing on how objects change over time.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar began with three overview talks from researchers in different areas (trajectory analysis, algorithmic topology, and graph drawing) to motivate and introduce problems which would fit the theme of changes over time in the representations of low-dimensional objects in higher dimensional spaces.  We then invited all participants to describe open problems (most of which were circulated in advance of the meeting) that fit with the topic of the workshop and could benefit from broad expertise.  For the remainder of the workshop we split into small working groups each focussed on a particular open problem. \n</p> \n <p>\nThroughout the workshop we used Coauthor, a tool for collaboration designed by Erik Demaine (MIT), to share progress and updates among all the working groups.  This, together with twice-daily progress reports, allowed us to share ideas and expertise among all participants, which  was very effective.  Another advantage was that we had a record of the work accomplished when the workshop ended.\n</p> \n <p>\nBelow, we (the organizers) describe the main working group topics and how they connected to the overarching theme.  The abstracts of talks in the seminar and preliminary results from the working groups are also outlined later in this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne group worked on open questions that were motivated by 3-manifolds.  In particular, they considered lower bounds for deciding the complexity of a knot or link equivalence, with a goal of finding specific knots that require many simplification moves.  Their work involved both designing smaller examples, as well as doing larger scale exhaustive search using the software tool Regina.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother group considered representations of graphs and hypergraphs by touching polygons in 3-d.  They were able to leverage the dual graph of the polyhedral complex in 3d, and make progress on classifying which types of graphs could (or could not) be realized.  Their problem was primarily combinatorial, but the techniques used included several interesting topological arguments about embeddings of manifolds into 3d or into 3-manifolds. \n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral groups considered problems about flows or morphs of curves in various settings.  One question centered on visualizing actual embedded homotopies on a given surface; there is considerable prior work on how to compute such homotopies between curves quickly, but it  generally focuses on computing the complexity of the homotopy as opposed to the actual sequence of simplifications needed.  The group looked more closely at this algorithm, and was able to outline a proof that in fact an extension of that algorithm would generate the actual homotopy, for a slightly higher time cost.  A second group considered curves in the plane, and investigated options for computing a \"nice\" morph between them.  As the question was more vague, the group did quite a bit of background investigation on prior work, and then discussed a new technique based on 3-manifolds and normal surface theory which might lead to a new family of morphs.  A third group looked at the problem of preprocessing a given curve so that the Fr\u00e9chet distance to any other query curve could be efficiently computed, and were able to obtain improved time bounds for several variants of the problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn summary, the workshop fostered a highly collaborative environment where combining the expertise and knowledge of researchers from different communities allowed us to solve problems of common interest across those communities.  A major theme was how connected the various problems could be; often, a proof technique or piece of literature suggested by a member of a different community proved useful or insightful to a group working in a different domain.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Erin Moriarty Wolf Chambers, Maarten L\u00f6ffler, Anna Lubiw, and Saul Schleimer\n                </div> \n",

This is nowhere near saturation, especially with the coming Internet-of-Things on the horizon.\n</p> \n <p>Underlying this technology are fundamental questions: how to efficiently configure and adapt communication links, organize access to the medium, overcome interference, and disseminate information. Unfortunately, the wireless medium is tricky, and the modeling of signal propagation and interference has proved to be\nhighly involved, with additional challenges introduced by issues such as mobility, energy limitations, and device heterogeneity. New technologies such as cooperative MIMO, directional antennas, interference alignment, network coding, energy harvesting and motion control add another layer of complexity, and\nare yet to be well-understood. Deriving good algorithms and protocols is therefore a non-trivial task.\n</p> \n <h3>Communities</h3> \n <p>Different schools of thought have arisen to tackle these fundamental questions. These come from different backgrounds, involving different types of mathematical tools and different approaches and outlooks. It is not just a theory vs. practice split, but also splits within the theory and the practice camps.\nIn addition to the more established information theory, there has been quite some\nwork on network control theory, and also a budding algorithmic theory; on top of physical-layer hardware experimentation, we see also networking systems research and simulation studies.\n</p> \n <p>We identified the following communities, which are not all exclusive:\n</p> \n <p><b>Information Theory</b> Characterized by an interest in fundamental information-theoretic capacity bounds; novel communication paradigms such as MIMO, network coding, interference cancellation, interference alignment; estimation and detection under known stochastic models of noise.\n</p> \n <p><b>Algorithm Theory</b> Characterized by a focus on algorithms, their complexity and effectiveness, with emphasis on rigorous proofs and typically worst-case analysis.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Prime publication venues:</em> PODC, DISC, STOC, SODA, ICALP (Track C)\n</p> \n <p><b>Experimental Mobile and Wireless Systems</b> Characterized by the design, implementation, and evaluation of practical wireless systems in real testbeds and real-world applications that both both evaluate the efficacy of previously-known techniques and their combinations \"in the wild\" and add design insight by developing novel heuristic algorithms and architectures that are shown to perform well in practice. \n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Prime publication venues:</em> MobiCom, MobiHoc, SIGCOMM, NSDI, SenSys, IPSN, BuildSys, MobiSys.</p> \n <p><b>Physical Layer and Hardware Design</b> Characterized by the design, implementation, and evaluation of new hardware, signal processing techniques.\nThe theoretical members of this community have a lot of overlap with information theory, while the more experimental members of this community have a lot of overlap with the experimental wireless and mobile systems community in terms of the problems they consider and their solution approaches. \n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Prime publication venues:</em> IEEE Trans. on Wireless, IEEE Trans. on Comms., IEEE Globecom, IEEE Vehicular Technology Conf.\n</p> \n <h3> Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The goal of this Dagstuhl seminar is to bring together top researchers from the different wireless research\ncommunities to review and discuss models and methods in order to obtain a better understanding of the\ncapabilities and limitations of modern wireless networks, and to come up with more realistic models and\nnew algorithm and protocol design approaches for future wireless networks that may then be investigated in\njoint research projects.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn important part of the workshop is to actively promote a dialog between different communities. As a\nresult, we seek researchers that are by nature open to different perspectives and have enough self-confidence\nto welcome research of a different nature. The objective was for each participant to consciously reflect on the\nimplicit values, identity, shared understandings and skill set that people in his/her community expect, and \nto articulate these issues to others in order to identify and appreciate commonalities and differences, and \nthe potential gains from forming new bridges.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Operation</h3> \n <p>The seminar had varied forms of activities during its operation. As people came from different communities, a major objective was to get to know each other.\n</p> \n <p><b>\"Speak-and-spark\" presentations</b> All the participants gave a brief, 5-10 minute pitch talk on a problem that they have been (or would to be) working on. Most of these were given on the first day, which provided a way of introducing one another, as well as a way to spark discussions that could be continued in private, in small groups, or in plenum. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Survey presentations</b> Seven senior researchers were asked to give a one-hour survey talk on a topic of current interest. These were spread over the days excluding the first.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Breakout sessions</b> Several topical issues were identified as particularly suitable for group discussions. The participants voted on the topics of their interest, after which three were selected. The groups were chosen so as to feature representatives from the different communities. Two such rounds of breakout sessions were organized on Tuesday. The discussions were summarized by the group leaders (often with the help of the scribes) for the whole audience on Wednesday morning, followed by discussions.\n</p> \n <p><b>\"Important paper\" pitches</b> The participants were encouraged to identify research paper(s) that open \"new\" research areas and/or pose questions in their community. This was also a means to articulating what researchers in that subfield found essential or influential.\nThese were the presented in 5-10 minutes, followed by open questions.\n</p> \n <p><b>Plenary discussions</b> Part of the last day's morning was allocated to general discussions around the themes posed during the seminar, with the aim of identifying future problem directions and research areas.\n</p> \n <p>Abstracts and summaries of these talks and discussions are given in the following sections.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Christina Fragouli, Magn\u00fas M.

            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nVisualizing textual information is a particularly challenging area of information visualization and visual analytics research. The types of data processing and analytic algorithms differ greatly from tabular or geospatial data, and the visualization techniques have additional constraints to consider, including the provision of context for text fragments of similar or different size and structure, depicting embeddings and high dimensional representations, and ensuring legibility of text incorporated into visualizations. The wide variation in the data is accompanied by the difficulties in inferring the semantic meaning of ambiguous terms, or determining the referencing between subsequent statements.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar succeeded in bringing together  researchers from the visualization, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning communities, with domain experts from several text-related research areas, to identify the most pressing and promising open problems for collaborative research. This truly interdisciplinary approach offered new opportunities to capitalize on existing knowledge and recent developments across all involved disciplines. Discussions in the seminar were comprehensive, focusing on visual text analytics with the goal to provide an application-oriented research agenda. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar coalesced an international community of experts from different disciplines around a research roadmap for the next 5\u201310 years, as documented through working group reports. The seminar generated a series of research questions which serve as a call to action to the wider community. The unique and contained setting of Schloss Dagstuhl facilitated new cross-disciplinary collaborations and allowed us to lay the groundwork for productive future collaborations, including a planned special issue of the Information Visualization journal. \n</p> \n <h4>Seminar Themes</h4> \n <p>The following high-level themes were discussed during the seminar. The seminar allowed attendees to critically reflect on current research efforts, the state of field, and key research challenges today. Participants also were encouraged to demonstrate their system prototypes and tools relevant to the seminar topics. As a result of the first working groups, as well as impromptu demonstrations and discussions, the actual seminar discussion topics evolved and we established a second set of working groups halfway through the week, cf. Sect. 6.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Data Sources and Diversity</b> What is the current landscape of the application fields and data domains? What are the data gaps? Can existing approaches be generalized?\n<li><b>Model Explainability and Interpretability</b> Can we provide more sophisticated visualizations to study how language models learn or what information they represent?\n<li><b>Evaluation and Experimental Designs</b> Which experimental methods best support the evaluation of techniques and processes for visualizing text information?\n<li><b>Interaction Design</b> What design opportunities are unique to, or more pressing, for text data? How can interaction principles be applied to any underlying NLP as well?\n<li><b>Toolkits and Standards</b> What success stories regarding existing text visualization approaches and systems can we learn from? What is needed?\n<li><b>TextVis Literacy</b> Visual text analytics can be applied across a wide variety of domains. How do we make techniques easy to learn and to interpret correctly?\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl team performed an evaluation at the end of the seminar week. The results of this survey (scientific quality, inspiration to new ideas/projects/research/papers, insights from neighboring fields, ...) were universally very good to excellent. Only a few single improvements were proposed by participants, for example, having longer breaks and mixing up the demo presentations with the other parts of the schedule. Another suggestion was to skip the intermediate group report session because it interrupted the group work.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the end of the week the organizers agreed to proceed to arrange for a special issue of the journal Information Visualization, which will have an open call but with the intent to include any extended works resulting from the seminar. In addition, several working groups with more \"position paper\" style reports planed to submit these to well-read venues accepting of editorial works which motivate the research community. \n</p> \n <h4>Remaining Challenges in Visual Text Analytics</h4> \n <p>Not all topics identified during the seminar could be addressed in the working groups and might be left for a future Dagstuhl seminar on a similar subject area. In the following, we briefly list those topics and open problems (more are surely existing that are not mentioned here):\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Interaction Design:</em> Interaction methodologies as part of any visual text analytics approach were in the focus of several working groups. A more systematic classification and evaluation of interaction techniques that are unique for text data would be useful for future developments.\n<li><em>Toolkits and Standards:</em> Even if many toolkits and existing standards were discussed in the seminar, a proper and comprehensive analysis of those is still missing that would be beneficial for users and developers of visual text analytics systems. \n<li><em>TextVis Literacy:</em> This topic is important to broaden the use of visual text analytics techniques in general and should be studied deeper in the future.\n<li><em>Focus on Text Data Aspects:</em> The consideration of data diversity, data fusion, and data organization in context of visual text analytics might be an interesting topic for further discussion.\n<li><em>Focus on Specific NLP and ML Methods:</em> The increasing number of specific/novel analytical methods (such as transfer learning or others) raise the need for specific answers from the visual text analytics community.\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul> \n <h3>Acknowledgments</h3> \n <p>We would like to thank all participants of the seminar for the lively discussions and contributions during the seminar as well as the scientific directorate of Dagstuhl Castle for giving us the possibility of organizing this event. Angelos Chatzimparmpas gathered the abstracts for the overview of the invited talks, the tool demos, and the working groups in Sect. 4, Sect. 5, and Sect. 6, respectively. Once more, we are thankful to all the attendees for agreeing to compose the abstract texts and timely provide them to us in order to write this executive summary. Last but not least, the seminar would not have been possible without the great help of the staff at Dagstuhl Castle. We acknowledge all of them and their assistance.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Christopher Collins, Antske Fokkens, Andreas Kerren, and Chris Weaver\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar on \"Technologies to Support Critical Thinking in an Age of Misinformation\" ran over a course of three days in April 2022.  Each day focused on one specific aspect of the problem of Misinformation and the role technologies play in its worsening and mitigation. \n</p> \n <p>\nDay 1 put the overall seminar goals and an introduction to the topic into its focus. All participants introduced themselves and gave a concrete example of an important challenge they have identified. The collected challenges were organized and later used as core challenges for group work activities, here Regulations/Policies, Human Factors and Platforms, and Critical Thinking. Over the course of the three days three groups worked on defining challenge statements (Day 1), ideas to solve the issue (Day 2), and concrete Research Questions and Project/Collaboration proposals (Day 3). \n</p> \n <p>\nThe theoretical underpinnings of all group discussions and activities were provided by a series of presentations that were topically organized. Day 1 was centered around how the problem of misinformation has evolved and why misinformation is so successful these days. A historical overview was given by keynote speaker Prof. Emma Spiro, which concluded with the key insights that Networks and platforms shape information flow and that attention dynamics matter. The second keynote talk of the day was given by Prof. Andreas Dengel that put light on the crucial role that images and their power to convey information that is tainted with emotional information, and how technology (e.g, CNNs) can be used to detect those, classify them, and can potentially correct them. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn day 2, the participants zeroed in on the role technology plays. Session 1, started with a keynote by Prof. Niels van Berkel on the role of Artificial Intelligence, and Human-AI interaction. Looking at Technology, Society, and Policy on a larger scale, van Berkel identified the core issue that there exists a lack of literacy on the tech side as well as on the regulatory side, a potential consequence of the lack of qualified tech personnel on regulatory bodies. Keynote 2, by Prof. Laurence Devillers, looked at how technology is used to misinform, deceive, and change public opinion, while proposing solutions, such as Nudging and Boosting techniques, how Human-Ai interaction should be better understood, and how research and industry must work together to mitigate the problem of lacking literacy. In session 2 of the day, Prof. Albrecht Schmid led an open, provocative discussion that served as a brainstorming session for the upcoming group work, mainly focussing on the role of platforms and technology. The third keynote was given by Prof. Stephen Lewandowsky who gave a detailed account of the role of human cognition and the larger impact of misinformation on democratic societies. He identified pressure points and proposes countermeasures that are effective but need to be scaled up through improved and coordinated cross-country regulation. Day 2 ended with a Misinformation Escape Room group activity (demo), led by Dr. Chris Coward, which aims at teaching players the power of misinformation and the complexity of the problem. \n</p> \n <p>\nDay 3 featured the keynote by Roger Taylor which strongly focussed on the way misinformation is regulated globally, and how regulatory frameworks (Digital Service Act) and effective regulation can help to mitigate the misinformation problem. As an advisor to the UK government, and an expert in responsible AI programs and data ethics, Roger Taylor put a light on pain points in the bureaucracy and the misaligned aims of technology development and research, and politics.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andreas Dengel, Laurence Devillers, Tilman Dingler, Koichi Kise, and Benjamin Tag\n                </div> \n",

The seminar had been originally planned for June of 2020 but was then postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was held in a hybrid format, with some participants on-site in Dagstuhl and most others joining remotely via the video conferencing system Zoom.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to maximize discussion and allow the interests of the group to drive the direction of the seminar, we did not plan for formal talks. Participants were asked to prepare a single slide, few-minute introduction about their research interests and methodologies related to digital disinformation, and a !burning question\" they have in the space.\n</p> \n <p>Participants included the following individuals, spanning a range of expertise from computer science to law:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Esma A\u00efmeur (University of Montr\u00e8al, Canada)\n</li><li>Jos Baeten (CWI Amsterdam, Netherlands)\n</li><li> Asia Biega (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Germany)\n</li><li> Camille Darche (CNPEN, Inria and Universit\u00e9 Paris Nanterre, France)\n</li><li> S\u00e9bastien Gambs (Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Canada)\n</li><li> Krishna Gummadi (Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany)\n</li><li> Claude Kirchner (CNPEN/CCNE and Inria, France)\n</li><li> Vladimir Kropotov (Trend Micro, Russia)\n</li><li> Jean-Yves Marion (Lorraine University, France)\n</li><li> Evangelos Markatos (University of Crete, Greece)\n</li><li> Fil Menczer (Indiana University, USA)\n</li><li> Trisha Meyer (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium)\n</li><li> Franziska Roesner (University of Washington, USA)\n</li><li> Kav\u00e9 Salamatian (University of Savoie, France)\n</li><li> Juliette S\u00e9n\u00e9chal (University of Lille, France)\n</li><li> Dimitrios Serpanos (University of Patras, Greece)\n</li><li> Serena Villata (CNRS, France)\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nBased on our preliminary discussions, we identified four topics of interest to many seminar participants: <i>trustworthiness algorithms</i> (i.e., how to build systems that assess trust automatically), <i>friction as a technique in platform design</i> (e.g., to allow for people to take  time and a step back when consuming information on social media),\n<i>the ethics of interventions</i> (e.g., the ethics of blocking or content moderation), and <i>how to educate users</i> (e.g., without creating over-skepticism). We then structured the rest of the seminar around four deep-dive conversations on these topics, described in the subsequent sections of this report. Due to the relatively small size of the gathering, and most participants' broad interest in all four topics, we did not break out into smaller discussion groups but rather continued to discuss as a full group.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Claude Kirchner and Franziska Roesner\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nDeep learning is currently one of most active areas of\nresearch in machine learning and its applications, including\nnatural language processing (NLP). One hallmark of deep learning\nis <em>end-to-end learning</em>: all parameters of a deep learning\nmodel are optimized <em>directly for the learning objective</em>; e.g., for the objective of accuracy on the binary classification task: is the input image the image of a cat? Crucially, the set of parameters that are optimized includes \"first-layer\" parameters that connect the raw input representation (e.g., pixels) to the first layer of internal representations of the\nnetwork (e.g., edge detectors). In contrast, many other machine learning\nmodels employ hand-engineered features to take the role of these\nfirst-layer parameters.\n</p> \n <p>\nEven though deep learning has had a number of successes in NLP, research on true end-to-end learning is just beginning to emerge. Most NLP deep learning models still start with a  hand-engineered layer of representation, the level of tokens or words, i.e., the input is broken up into units by\nmanually designed tokenization rules. Such rules often fail to capture structure both within tokens (e.g., morphology) and across multiple tokens (e.g., multi-word expressions). Given the success of end-to-end learning in other domains, it is likely that it will also be widely used in NLP to alleviate these issues and lead to great advances.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together researchers from deep learning, general machine learning, natural language processing and computational linguistics to develop a research agenda for the coming years. The goal was to combine recent <em>advances in deep learning architectures and algorithms</em>  with <em>extensive domain knowledge about language</em> to make <em>true end-to-end\nlearning for NLP</em> possible.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur goals were to make progress on answering the following research questions.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>C2NLU approaches so far fall short of the state of the art in  cases where token structures can easily be  exploited (e.g., in well-edited newspaper text) compared to word-level approaches. What are promising avenues for developing C2NLU to match the state of the art even in these cases of text with well-defined token structures? \n</li><li> Character-level models are computationally more expensive than word-level models because detecting syntactic and semantic relationships at the\ncharacter-level is more expensive (even though it is potentially more         robust) than at the word-level. How can we address the resulting       challenges in scalability for character-level models?\n</li><li>Part of the mantra of deep learning is that domain expertise is no longer necessary. Is this really true or is knowledge about the fundamental properties of language necessary for C2NLU? Even if that expertise is not needed for feature engineering, is it needed to design model architectures, tasks and training regimes?\n</li><li> NLP tasks are diverse, ranging from part-of-speech tagging over         sentiment analysis to question answering. For which of these problems is         C2NLU a promising approach, for which not?\n</li><li> More generally, what characteristics make an NLP problem amenable to     be addressed using tokenization-based approaches vs. C2NLU approaches?\n</li><li> What specifically can each of the two communities involved - natural\nlanguage processing and deep learning - contribute to C2NLU?\n</li><li> Create an NLP/deep learning roadmap for research in C2NLU over the       next 5--10 years.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Phil Blunsom, Kyunghyun Cho, Chris Dyer, and Hinrich Sch\u00fctze\n                </div> \n",

Especially we aimed to discuss the possibilities of combining fields like tropical geometry with more classical techniques as for instance from mathematical morphology. We discussed possibilities of applying machine learning methods in this context and considered recent advances from more classical fields like differential\ngeometry and partial differential equations that can be useful for setting up and understanding shape analysis methods in all of these approaches.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this seminar was to address these challenges with the latest tools related to geometric, algorithmic and numerical concepts. To do so, we brought together researchers working on shape analysis topics from different perspectives. The purpose in bringing together researchers from those different communities sharing substantial interest in shape analysis was to explore the benefits of a cross-disciplinary point of view. \n</p> \n <p>\nPromising new ways to combine the latest techniques from these different fields were identified during in-depth discussions in small groups.

From the proposed topics on algorithm choices, join sequences, updates, database utilities, parallelism and skew, column stores, physical database design, and explainability of non-robust query performance, the participants chose four topics and formed four work groups: i) one discussing updates and database utilities, ii) one discussing parallelism and skew, iii) one discussing join sequences, and iv) one focusing on the explanations of the sources of non-robust performance.\n</p> \n <p>\nUpon choosing the topics of interest, the organizers then guided the participants to approach the topic through a set of steps: by first considering related work in the area; then introducing metrics and tests that will be used for testing the validity and robustness of the solution;  after metrics, the focus was on proposing specific mechanisms for the proposed approaches; and finally the last step focused on the implementation policies.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar thus spent its first day on reviewing prior related work, with a special emphasis on the pieces of work that appeared following the previous instances of the seminar: benchmarks (Dagstuhl 12321), Smooth Scan , and Generalized join.\n</p> \n <p>\n Tuesday was spent on defining metrics and tests. On Wednesday, the participants discussed possible alternative approaches and hiked together in the woods. Thursday was focused on driving one chosen approach to specific mechanisms. Finally, we spent Friday on discussing the policies and presented the overall progress.\n </p> \n <p>\n  At the end of the week, each group was hoping to continue their work towards a research publication. The group on parallelism and skew was hoping to publish first a survey on forms of skew and existing remedies for skew. The work group on dynamic join sequences even had a working prototype by the end of the seminar.\nThe reports of work groups are presented next.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Renata Borovica-Gajic, Goetz Graefe, Allison Lee, and Glenn Paulley\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Managing Technical Debt in Software Engineering",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe term <em>technical debt</em> refers to delayed tasks and immature artifacts that constitute a \"debt\" because they incur extra costs in the future in the form of increased cost of change during evolution and maintenance. The technical debt metaphor provides an effective mechanism for communicating design trade-offs between developers and other decision makers. When managed effectively, technical debt provides a way to gauge the current maintainability of a system and correct the course when that level is undesirable.  While other software engineering disciplines -- such as software sustainability, maintenance and evolution, refactoring, software quality, and empirical software engineering -- have produced results relevant to managing technical debt, none of them alone suffice to model, manage, and communicate the different facets of the design trade-off problems involved in managing technical debt. \n</p> \n <p>\nDespite recent progress by the research community in understanding technical debt, increased attention by tool vendors on assessing technical debt through code conformance checking, and collaboration with industry in sharing data and challenges, there are several open questions about the role of technical debt in software development. The goal of this seminar was to establish a common understanding of key concepts of technical debt and build a road map for future work in this area to address these open questions.\n</p> \n <p><b>How do we define and model technical debt?</b> The software engineering community is converging on defining <em>technical debt</em> as making technical compromises that are expedient in the short term, but that create a technical context that increases complexity and cost in the long term. While the conceptual roots of technical debt imply an idealized, deliberate decision-making process and rework strategy as needed, we now understand that technical debt is often incurred unintentionally and catches software developers by surprise. Hence, it is mostly observed during maintenance and evolution. Technical debt as a metaphor serves as a strong communication mechanism, but the community now understands that technical debt is also a software development artifact. This overloaded nature creates confusion, especially for newcomers to the field. In addition, there is a risk of associating anything detrimental to software systems and development processes with technical debt. This risk necessitates crisply defining both technical debt and related concepts.\n</p> \n <p><b>How do we manage technical debt?</b> Well-defined benchmarks provide a basis for evaluating new approaches and ideas. They are also an essential first step toward creating an empirical basis on which work in this area can grow more effectively. Effective and well-accepted benchmarks allow researchers to validate their work and tailor empirical studies to be synergistic. Technical debt\u2019s evolving definition and its sensitivity to context have inhibited the development of benchmarks so far. An ideal benchmark for technical debt research would consist of a code base, architectural models (perhaps with several versions), and known technical-debt items (TD items). New approaches to identify technical debt could be run against these artifacts to see how well the approaches reveal TD items. Industry needs guidance for how and what data to collect and what artifacts they can make available to enable progress in understanding, measuring, and managing technical debt. \n</p> \n <p><b>How do we establish an empirical basis and data science for technical debt?</b>\n</p> <h3>Seminar Format</h3> \n <p>In this seminar, we brought together researchers, practitioners, and tool vendors from academia and industry who are interested in the theoretical foundations of technical debt and how to manage it from measurement and analysis to prevention. Before the seminar,  the organizers created a blog where attendees could post positions and start discussions to facilitate seeding of ideas. \n</p> \n <p>\nBefore the seminar, the organizers grouped discussions and blog entries into relevant themes that included creating a common definition and conceptual model of technical debt, measurement and analysis of technical debt, management of technical debt, and a research road map for managing technical debt. \n</p> \n <p>\nOur goal was to make this seminar a working week; hence we had a dynamic schedule. We did not feature any long talks. Each day had three types of sessions. There was a plenary session for \"lightning talks,\" in which each presenter had 10 minutes for presentation and questions on each day except for the last day of the seminar. The second type of session was for breakout discussions. Breakout sessions focused on themes that emerged from the blog and the goals of the seminar. Participants first discussed these in randomly assigned small groups in order to maximize cross-pollination of ideas. Last, we had plenary discussion sessions to collate and summarize the discussions during the breakouts. At the end of each day, the organizers asked for feedback and adjusted the flow of the following day accordingly. As a result, we dedicated the fourth day of the seminar to an \"un-conference\"' format in which the discussion topic emerged based on the interests and votes of the attendees. The summaries of these sessions are included in Section 5: Open Problems.\n</p> \n <h3>The Definition of Technical Debt and a Conceptual Model</h3> \n <p>At the conclusion of the seminar, attendees agreed on the following working definition of technical debt, which we refer to as the 16162 definition of technical debt:\n</p> \n <p>In software-intensive systems, technical debt is a collection of design or implementation constructs that are expedient in the short term, but set up a technical context that can make future changes more costly or impossible. Technical debt presents an actual or contingent liability whose impact is limited to internal system qualities, primarily maintainability and evolvability.</p> \n <p>\nA significant outcome of the week was the recognition that, similar to other complex software engineering artifacts, technical debt is best described through multiple viewpoints. Concepts related to technical debt in particular should be discussed based on two related viewpoints: \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>the viewpoint describing the properties, artifacts, and elements related to technical debt items\n</li><li> the viewpoint articulating the management- and process-related activities to perform, or the different states that debt may go through\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nFigure 1 shows the initial conceptual model that served as the starting point for discussions. This model helped the group converge on key concepts. Mismatches occurred when the discussions focused on causes that may or may not be input to measurement and analysis. The dynamic view is intended to articulate these aspects. \n</p> \n <p>The technical debt associated with a software-intensive system is composed of a set of TD items, and this technical debt is one of many concerns associated with a system.  TD items have both causes and consequences. The cause of technical debt can be a process, a decision, an action (or lack thereof), or an event that triggers the existence of that TD item, such as schedule pressure, unavailability of a key person, or lack of information about a technical feature.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe consequences of a TD item are many: technical debt can effect the value of the system, the costs of future changes, the schedule, and system quality. The business objectives of the sponsoring organization developing or maintaining the software system are affected in several ways: through delays, loss of quality for some features of the system, and difficulties in maintaining the system operations (continuance).\n</p> \n <p>\nA TD item is associated with one or more concrete, tangible artifacts of the software development process, primarily the code, but also to some extent the documentation, known defects, and tests associated with the system.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo keep with the financial metaphor, the cost impact of technical debt can be seen as composed of principal and interest. The principal is the cost savings gained by taking some initial approach or shortcut in development (the initial principal, often the initial benefit) or the cost that it would now take to develop a different or better solution (the current principal).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe interest is comprised of costs that add up as time passes. There is recurring interest: additional cost incurred by the project in the presence of technical debt, due to reduced velocity (or productivity), induced defects, and loss of quality (maintainability is affected). And there are accruing interests: the additional cost of the developing new software depending on not-quite-right code (evolvability is affected).\n</p> \n <p>\nThis view summarizing the elements related to technical debt, however, does not  capture causes that may or may not be input to measurement and analysis, the activities that need to be conducted to manage technical debt, and the states debt may go through. Another view is intended to articulate these aspects. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis definition and the model serve as the starting point for the community to build on and improve.\n</p> \n <h3>Research Road Map</h3> \n <p>One outcome of the seminar was a broad agenda for future work in technical debt research. While this road map needs to be fleshed out in the future with more detailed research questions and problem statements, it lays out three areas that require attention. First is the identification of a core concept -- value -- that is central to the technical debt metaphor and that needs definition and operationalization. Second is a recognition that there is an important context to technical debt that should be studied. There are attributes of the context of any particular instance of technical debt in a real environment that must be understood. But there are also other phenomena that are related to technical debt that should be studied, such as other types of \"debt.\" Third, the road map lays out the community's basic infrastructure needs, which will enable further collaboration and progress in this area. The research road map that arose out of the discussions at Dagstuhl is described in more detail in this report under Sectio 4: Working Groups.\n</p> \n <h3>Follow-up Work</h3> \n <p>At the seminar, participants recognized that a carefully considered conceptual model and research road map would be useful outputs for the broader community interested in managing technical debt. Hence, more comprehensive explanation of a conceptual model and the research road map are planned as publications in appropriate venues once the community has a chance to vet the ideas further. The blog established before the seminar will continue to facilitate this interaction.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ipek Ozkaya and Philippe Kruchten and Robert Nord and Paris Avgeriou and Carolyn Seaman\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAs manufacturing goes digital, we are facing a fundamental change in the workflow of fabrication. While access to advanced digital fabrication and 3D-printing technology becomes ubiquitous and provides new possibilities for fabricating complex, functional, multi-material objects with unconventional properties, its potential impact is currently limited by the lack of efficient and intuitive methods for content creation. Existing tools are usually restricted to expert users, have been developed based on the capabilities of traditional manufacturing processes, and do not sufficiently take fabrication constraints into account. Scientifically, we are facing the fundamental challenge that existing simulation techniques and design approaches for predicting the physical properties of materials and objects at the resolution of modern 3D printers fail to scale well with possible object complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo achieve significant progress, we need a deep understanding of interdisciplinary fundamentals: Shape, Appearance of Shape and Materials, Validated Simulation, and Engineering Design. The purpose of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to bring together leading experts from academia and industry in the area of computer graphics, geometry processing, mechanical engineering, human-computer interaction, material science, and robotics. The goal is to address fundamental questions and issues related to computational aspects of fabrication, build bridges between related fields, and further pioneer this area.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere has been a considerable growth in the number of articles treating aspects of computational fabrication, scattered across multiple disciplines and journals. In this seminar we gathered together these various threads and described the computational accomplishments and outstanding challenges. Researchers from different communities analyzed which existing fabrication workflows could benefit most from computation and identify novel application domains, with the aim of cross-fertilizing ideas between disciplines. The main goal of this seminar was identifying and reporting common grand challenges and developing a roadmap for addressing them. Additionally, the seminar seeked to discuss and establish standards and best practices for sharing research results, code, and hardware prototypes, facilitating reproducibility and reusability of results among disciplines. An important aspect of this was to analyze teaching and learning needs for new students in the field, and coordinating the development of teaching material. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marc Alexa, Jessica K.

            "title": "Foundations of Data Visualization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nData Visualization is the transformation of data, derived from observation or simulation, and models into interactive images. It has become an indispensable part of the knowledge discovery process in many fields of contemporary endeavor. Since its inception about three decades ago, the techniques of data visualization have aided scientists, engineers, medical practitioners, analysts, and others in the study of a wide variety of data, including numerical simulation based on high-performance computing, measured data from modern scanners (CT, MR, seismic imaging, satellite imaging), and survey and sampled data, and metadata about data confidence or provenance. One of the powerful strengths of data visualization is the effective and efficient utilization of the broad bandwidth of the human sensory system in interpreting and steering complex processes involving spatiotemporal data across a diverse set of application disciplines. Since vision dominates our sensory input, strong efforts have been made to bring the mathematical abstraction and modeling to our eyes through the mediation of computer graphics. The interplay between these multidisciplinary foundations of visualization and currently emerging, new research challenges in data visualization constitute the basis of this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe rapid advances in data visualization have resulted in a large collection of visual designs, algorithms, software tools, and development kits. There is also a substantial body of work on mathematical approaches in visualizations such as topological methods, feature extraction approaches, and information theoretical considerations. However, a unified description of theoretical and perceptual aspects of visualization would allow visualization practitioners to derive even better solutions using a sound theoretical basis. There are promising ideas but they need further discussion.  Currently, we employ user studies to decide if a visual design is more effective, but a comprehensive theory would allow visualization researchers to answer why one visual design is more effective than another and how the visual design can be optimized. Furthermore, we usually have an understanding of the role of a specific visualization in a specific analytic workflow, but we would like to formalize the general role of visualization in the analytic workflow. This would also allow for more quantitative measures of visualization quality. In addition, the community needs a deeper, general understanding of the most informative way to conduct perceptual and usability studies involving domain experts. \n</p> \n <p>\nFor this seminar, we chose to take a focused consideration of the foundations of visualization in order to establish an integrated discussion on the fundamental understanding and generic methodologies of data visualization, including theories, models and workflows of data visualization, evaluation metrics, and perceptual and usability studies. We included experts from all areas of visualization such as scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics to allow for an in-depth discussion of our shared research foundations based on a broad expertise. \n</p> \n <p>\nWith the experience of delivering technical advances over the past three decades, it is timely for the visualization community to address these fundamental questions with a concerted effort. Such an effort will be critical to the long-term development of the subject, especially in building a theoretical foundation for the subject. The community needs to develop suitable models for the whole visualization process from cleaning and filtering the data, analysis processing, mapping to graphical scenes, to the interpretation by the human visual system. While there are some methods of evaluation based on user studies and findings in applications, a complete theoretical foundation for evaluations is missing. Modern visualization includes advanced numerical and combinatorial data processing, so the correctness of this processing including a critical look at its assumptions with respect to the application at hand is needed. Only then, visualization can establish strong correlations between visualization algorithms and questions in the application domains. In addition, uncertainty has received attention from the visualization community in recent years, but a full analysis of uncertainty at all stages of the established visualization pipeline is still not available. Theoretical foundations of uncertainty in visualization need to look at uncertainty in the data, errors due to numerical processing, errors due to visual depiction and, finally, uncertainty in the results based on human misinterpretation of interactive visual depictions. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis workshop addressed five important topics:\n</p> \n <p>\nTheory of overall visualization process. A theory of the whole visualization process needs to cover all parts of the visualization pipeline and should be applicable to broad classes of application domains. Of course, it is the ultimate foundation, but there are a few formulation attempts and the seminar discussed them. Such a theory should allow to find optimal visualizations and to quantify the value of visualizations. In addition, it is strongly believed by most experts that such a theory needs to cover the challenge of uncertainty in the data, the processing including visual mapping and potential misinterpretation by human observers.\n</p> \n <p>\nFoundations of evaluation. Evaluation allows designers and analysts to select visualization approaches from among different options for a specific problem. One evaluation method is a user study, usually with a larger group of subjects. Here, it is often a challenge that there is only a very small set of experts available that understand the scientific questions behind the data. Guidelines for user study design in these situations are necessary. In addition, evaluation needs to look at limits of the human visual system. In advanced analytic applications, it is also very important to study the relation between user interest and visualization. There are many open questions in this area that will be discussed in the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nCollaboration with domain experts. Many visualizations address questions and needs from expert researchers, engineers, analysts, or decision makers. Therefore, visualization nearly always involves people outside the visualization community. The seminar included some representatives from large applied research centers so that the discussion about relations between visual data analysis and application semantics was not carried out without domain experts. These participants also commented on methodologies for defining domain requirements and realistic roles of application researchers in evaluation.\n</p> \n <p>\nVisualization for broad audiences.  Visualizations developed for broad audiences involve context and constraints different from those developed for expert domain collaborators. Such visualizations include those for personal information, school use, science centers and other public settings, and communication with a broad general public. Issues with developing visualizations for broad audiences include a higher need for intuitive metaphors and conventions, a larger imperative for drawing participants into interaction, and more requirements for robust interfaces and systems.   \n</p> \n <p>\nMathematical foundations of visual data analysis. There is a rich tradition of mathematical/computational methods used in visualization, such as topological approaches, mathematical descriptions of feature extraction, numerical sampling and reconstruction methods, integration, differential operators, filtering, dimension reduction, and applications of information theory. In addition, we have seen promising attempts to incorporate uncertainty in these mathematical approaches. While all these methods have a solid mathematical foundation, a careful look at the relation between theories in applications and these mathematical approaches in visual data analysis was taken in this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe format of the seminar incorporated several elements: overview talks on each topic, clusters of short talks on a single topic followed by a joint panel discussion, and breakout groups on each of the five topics. Unlike the typical arrangement, all presentations in each session were given in sequence\nwithout a short Q&amp;A session at the end of each talk. Instead, all speakers of a session were invited to sit on the stage after the presentations, and answer questions in a manner similar to panel discussions. This format successfully brought senior and junior researchers onto the same platform, and enabled researchers to seek a generic and deep understanding through their questions and answers. It also stimulated very long, intense, and fruitful discussions\nthat were embraced by all participants. The breakout groups focused on the general themes and are reported in a later section.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Penny Rheingans\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nData visualization is the \"use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognition\" [5]. Visualization can play a crucial role for exploring data and for communicating information as \"a picture is worth a thousand words\". Early research in this field focused on producing static images and quantifying the perception of different visual encodings [6] in these visual representations. The vast majority of research since then focused on designing and implementing novel interfaces and interactive techniques to enable data exploration. Major advances in visual analytics and big data initiatives concentrated on integrating machine learning and analysis methods with visual representations to enable powerful exploratory analysis and data mining [10]. As interactive visualizations play an increasing role in data analysis scenarios, they also started to appear as a powerful vector for communicating information. Stories supported by facts extracted from data analysis proliferate in many different forms from animated infographics and videos [2] to interactive online visualizations on news media outlets. We argue that it is now time for the visualization research community to understand how these powerful interactive visualizations play a role in communicating information. We define this line of research as data-driven storytelling.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe popularity of javascript web technology and the availability of the D3 toolkit [3] enabled a wider range of people to create data visualizations. Being able to easily share interactive data visualizations on the web also increased the democratization of interactive visualizations.  Coupled with the emphasis on data science, these advances raise new practices such as data journalism. Data journalists gather and explore available datasets to extract relevant insights, often conveying their stories via interactive data visualizations [1,9]. The popularity of data-driven stories on New York Times especially, revealed the potential of interactive visualizations as a powerful communication tool [7].\n</p> \n <p>\nCentral to our vision of the convening was that the vast majority of research on data visualization to date has focused on designing and implementing novel interfaces and interactive techniques to enable data exploration. Major advances in visual analytics and big data initiatives have concentrated on integrating machine learning and analysis methods with visual representations to enable powerful exploratory analysis and data mining. But just as interactive visualization plays an important role in data analysis scenarios it is also becoming increasingly important in structuring the communication and conveyance of insights and stories in a compelling format. Visual data-driven stories have proliferated in many different forms, from talks  [8], to animated infographics and videos [1, 9, 7], to interactive online visualizations. \n</p> \n <p>\nData-driven storytelling is also compelling for a wide range of applications. In enterprise scenarios, the output of data analysis (often reports and slide-based presentations) has to be conveyed to decision makers. In scientific research, interactive visualizations are increasingly used to convey data-driven discoveries to peers or used to communicate complex findings to a broader audience. In education scenarios, interactive visualizations are used by teachers to explain mathematical concepts or to illustrate biological or physical mechanisms.\nMany questions arise as interactive visualizations are used beyond data exploration by experts, for communication purposes to a broader audience.  Research on understanding of static images in cognitive psychology and perception must be extended to encompass more advanced techniques (videos and interactive applications). Visualization literacy, defined as the ability to extract, interpret, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an (interactive) data visualization is also a crucial component for data-driven storytelling research. Assessing the visualization literacy of an audience and developing techniques to better teach how to decode interactive visualizations has started to attract the attention of our research community [4] However a plethora of research remains to be done. For example, research on how visualizations can lie [11] or at least how they may introduce bias in the reader\u2019s mind has focused on static visual representations but has not yet been extended to other medium.  Similarly it is crucial for advancing researches in visualization to assess the role data-driven storytelling can play in easing the comprehension of a messages or in increasing their memorability.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe visualization research community needs to reflect on data-driven storytelling and to develop a research agenda to investigate how advanced data-driven stories are understood by the audience, identify factors that makes them compelling as well as factors that can introduce bias in their perception. By learning from master storytellers from other fields (journalism, design, art and education) strategies to craft successful stories, our community will be able to reflect on these questions and eventually build novel consuming tools that engage a broad audience while minimizing perception bias, as well as build novel authoring tools to craft high quality data-driven stories.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne domain where there has been extensive and practical progress on the question of data-driven storytelling is data journalism. News sites like FiveThirtyEight or the New York Times\u2019 The Upshot have seen a recent surge of attention and interest as a means of communicating data-driven news to the public. By carefully structuring the information and integrating explanation to guide the consumer, journalists help lead users toward a valid interpretation of the underlying data. Because of the rapid and practical progress of data-driven storytelling in the domain of journalism, our seminar sought to put some of the top practitioners from that field together with computer science researchers to discuss the challenges and opportunities of data-driven communication. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar was structured to leverage the interdisciplinarity of the attendees by first tapping into a divergent design thinking process meant to enumerate the range of issues that are relevant to data-driven stories. Hundreds of index cards and sticky notes were sacrificed as participants generated ideas (see Figure 1). \n</p> \n <p>We then clustered these ideas to arrived at a set of key themes, including:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Techniques and Design Choices for Storytelling\n</li><li> Exploration and Explanation \n</li><li> From Analysis to Communication\n</li><li> Audience\n</li><li> Evaluation\n</li><li> Devices and Gadgets \n</li><li> Ethics\n</li></ul> \n <p>Groups of participants formed around common interests and each of these major themes were then the focus of discussion. Each work group was geared towards developing an outline and plan to produce a written chapter for a forthcoming edited book on the topic of data-driven storytelling. Some groups met for a day or two and then reformed around other topics, whereas other groups spent the entire week going deep in exploring a single topic. And as if the daytime activities weren\u2019t enough, additional evening breakout groups formed around additional topics of interest like Education in Data Visualization, Urban Visualization, and the Technology Stack for data-driven stories.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn-between the intense, small group sessions the entire group came together daily for five-minute lightning talks on a wide array of relevant topics. These stimulating talks primed the group for approaching data-driven storytelling from different perspectives and were an entertaining and informative way to share creative ideas or results in small and easily digestible nuggets. Among the more than 25 lightning talks, topics ranged from storytelling with timelines, to mobile visualization, the use of data comics, visual literacy, affect and color, data-story design workflows, and even the visualization of data through cuisine. \n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nOur initial goal of the seminar was to have groups work intensively on their chosen topic(s) so that an outline and workplan could be developed to write a contributing chapter to a book on data-driven storytelling. The book is underway and will have contributions on each of the main themes outlined above, as well as an introductory chapter by the editors / organizers of the Dagstuhl seminar. Moreover, our creative contributors at the seminar produced other outputs as well: curated lists of example data driven stories, as well as of storytelling techniques were created and will be published online, and a blog has pulled together some of the formative impressions of participants (<a href=\"https://medium.com/data-driven-storytelling\">https://medium.com/data-driven-storytelling</a>). \n</p> <p>\nBelow we briefly summarize the expected contents of each of the chapters that will form the book. </p> \n <h4>Techniques and Design Choices for Storytelling</h4> \n <p>This chapter will discuss techniques and design choices for visual storytelling grounded in a survey of over 60 examples collected from various online news sources and from award-winning visualization and infographic design work. These design choices represent a middle ground between low-level visualization and interaction techniques and high-level narrative devices or structures. The chapter will define several classes of design choices: embellishment, explanation, exploration, navigation, story presentation, emphasis, focus, and annotation. Examples from the survey for each class of design choices will be provided. Finally, several case studies of examples from the survey that make use of multiple design choices will be developed.\n</p> \n <h4>Exploration and Explanation in Data-Driven Stories</h4> \n <p>\nThis chapter will explore the differences between and integration of exploration and explanation in visual data-driven storytelling. Exploratory visualizations allow for a lot of freedom which can include changing the visual representation, the focus of what is being shown and the sequence in which the data is viewed. They allow readers to find their own stories in the data. Explanatory stories include a focused message which is usually more narrow and guides the reader often in a linear way. Advantages and disadvantages of exploration and explanation as well as dimensions that help to describe and classify data-driven stories will be developed. The space is described by identifying freedom, guidance regarding representation, focus and sequence as well as interpretation as important dimensions of data-driven storytelling and existing systems are characterized along these dimensions. Recommendations will be developed for how to integrate both aspects of exploration and explanation in data-driven stories. \n</p> \n <h4>From Analysis to Communication: Supporting the Lifecycle of a Story</h4> \n <p>\nThis chapter will explore how tools can better support the authoring of rich and custom data stories with natural / seamless workflows. The aim is to understand the roles and limitations of analysis / authoring tools within current workflow practices and use these insights to suggest opportunities for future research and design. First, the chapter will report a summary of interviews with practitioners at the Dagstuhl seminar; these interviews aim to understand current workflow practices for analysis and authoring, the tools used to support those practices, and pain points in those processes. Then the chapter will reflect on design implications that may improve tool support for the authoring process as well as research opportunities related to such tool support. A strong theme is the interplay between analytical and communicative phases during both creation and consumption of data-driven stories.\n</p> \n <h4>The Audience for Data-Driven Stories</h4> \n <p>\nCreators of data-driven visual stories want to be as effective as possible in communicating their message. By carefully considering the needs of their audience, content creators can help their readers better understand their content. This chapter will describe four separate characteristics of audience that creators should consider: expertise and familiarity with the topic, the medium, data, and data visualization; expectations about how and what the story will deliver; how the reader uses the interface such as reading, scrolling, or other interactivity; and demographic characteristics of the audience such as age, gender, education, and location. This chapter will discuss how these audience goals match the goals of the creator, be it to inform, persuade, educate, or entertain. Then it will discuss certain risks creators should recognize, such as confusing or offending the reader, or using unfamiliar jargon or technological interfaces. Case studies from a variety of fields including research, media, and government organizations will be presented. \n</p> \n <h4>Evaluating Data-Driven Storytelling</h4> \n <p>\nThe study of data-driven storytelling requires specific guidelines, metrics, and methodologies reflecting their different complex aspects. Evaluation is not only essential for researchers to learn about the quality of data-driven storytelling but also for editorial rooms in media and enterprises to justify the required resources the gathering, analyzing and presentation of data. A framework will be presented that takes the different perspectives of author, audience and publisher and their correspondent criteria into account. Furthermore it connects them with the methods and metrics to provide a roadmap for what and how to measure if these resulting data-driven stories met the goals. In addition, the chapter will explore and define the constraints which might limit the metrics and methods available making it difficult to reach the goals. \n</p> \n <h4>Devices and Gadgets for Data Storytelling</h4> \n <p>\nThis chapter will discuss the role of different hardware devices and media in visual data driven storytelling. The different form factors offer different affordances for data storytelling affecting their suitability to the different data storytelling settings.  For example, wall displays are well suited to synchronous co-located presentation, while watches and virtual reality headsets work better for personal consumption of pre-authored data stories. \n</p> \n <h4>Ethics in Data-Driven Visual Storytelling</h4> \n <p>\nIs the sample representative, have we thought of the bias of whoever collected or aggregated the data, can we extract a certain conclusion from the dataset, is it implying something the data doesn\u2019t cover, does the visual device, or the interaction, or the animation affect the interpretation that the audience can have of the story? Those are questions that anyone that has produced or edited a data-driven visual story has, or at least should have, been confronted with. After introducing the space, and the reasons and implications of ethics in this space, this chapter will look at the risks, caveats, and considerations at every step of the process, from the collection/acquisition of the data, to the analysis, presentation, and publication. Each point will be supported by an example of a successful or flawed ethical consideration.\n</p> \n <h4>Conclusion</h4> \n <p>\nThe main objective of this Dagstuhl seminar was to develop an interdisciplinary research agenda around data-driven storytelling as we seek to develop generalizable findings and tools to support the use of visualization in communicating information. Productive group work converged to delineate several research opportunities moving forward: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> The need for interfaces that enable the fluid movement between exploratory and communicative visualization so that storytelling workflow is seamless and powerful. \n</li><li>  The need to develop typologies of visual storytelling techniques and structures used in practice so that opportunities for supporting these techniques can be sought through computing approaches.\n</li><li>  The need to develop evaluation frameworks that can assess storytelling techniques and tools both scientifically and critically.\n</li><li>  The need for design frameworks that can guide the structure of visual information for experiences across different output devices, both existing and future.\n</li><li> The need to understand the audience and their role in co-constructing meaning with the author of a data-driven story. \n</li><li> The need for ethical frameworks that should guide tool development for visual data-driven communication. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThese opportunities were productively enumerated at the Dagstuhl seminar and are in the process of being written up as chapters in our book on data-driven storytelling.\n</p> \n <h3>References:</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>\nAll the medalists: Men\u2019s 100-meter freestyle: Racing against history.

            "title": "Provenance and Logging for Sense Making",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSense making is one of the biggest challenges in data analysis faced by both industry and research community. It involves understanding the data and uncovering its model, generating hypothesis, select analysis methods, creating novel solutions, designing evaluation, and the critical thinking and learning wherever needed. Recently many techniques and software tools have become available to address the challenges of so-called `Big Data'. However, these mostly target lower-level sense making tasks such as storage and search. There is limited support for the higher-level sense making tasks mentioned earlier. As a result, these tasks are often performed manually and the limited human cognition capability becomes the bottleneck, negatively impacting data analysis and decision making. This applies to both industry and academia. Scientific research is a sense making process as well: it includes all the sense making tasks mentioned earlier, with an emphasis on the generation of novel solutions. Similar to data analysis, most of these are conducted manually and considerably limit the progress of scientific discovery.\n</p> \n <p><em>Visual Analytics</em> is a fast-growing field that specifically targets sense making [6]. It achieves this by integrating interactive visualization with data analytics such as Machine Learning. It follows a human-centered principle: instead of replacing human thinking and expertise with algorithms and models, it enables the two to work together to achieve the best sense making result. Fast progress has been made in the last decade or so, which is evidenced by the publications in the Visual Analytics conferences such as IEEE VAST (part of IEEE VIS) and the increasing popularity of visual approaches in many other fields such as Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, and Databases.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne recent advance in Visual Analytics research is the capture, visualization, and analysis of <em>provenance</em> information. Provenance is the history and context of sense making, including the \u201c7W\u201d (Who, When, What, Why, Where, Which, and HoW) of data used and the users\u2019 critical thinking process. The concept of provenance is not entirely new. In 1996, Shneiderman recognized the importance of provenance by classifying <em>history</em> as one of the seven fundamental tasks in data visualization [4]. History allows users to review previous actions during visual exploration, which is typically long and complex. Provenance can provide an overview of what has been examined and reveal the gap of unexplored data or solutions. Provenance can also support collaborative sense making and communication by sharing the rich context of what others have accomplished [7].\n</p> \n <p>\nThe topic of provenance has been studied in many other fields, such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), WWW, Database, and Reproducible Science. The HCI research community heavily relies on user information, such as logging and observation, in their study. These closely relate to provenance and share the common goal of making sense of user behavior and thinking. The collaboration between the two fields can potential create novel solutions for some long-standing research challenges. For instance, it has been shown that provenance\ninformation can be used to semi-automate part of the qualitative analysis of user evaluation data [3], which is notoriously time-consuming.\n</p> \n <p>The WWW and Database research community has been actively working on provenance for the last decade or so, with a particular focus on tracking data collection and processing. This has led to the recent publication of the W3C reference model on provenance. A important part of these efforts is to make sense of the source and quality of the data and the analyses base on them, which has a significant impact on their uncertainty and trustworthiness [1]. Similarly, there is a fast growing Reproducible Science community, whose\ninterest in provenance is \u201cimproving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research ... increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery\u201d [2].\n</p> \n <p>\nThere is a trend of cross-community collaboration on provenance-related research, which has led to some exciting outcomes such as the work integrating visualization with reproducible science [5, 8]. However, there are still many challenging research questions and many provenance-related research efforts remain disconnected. This seminar brought together researchers from the diverse fields that relate to provenance. Shared challenges were identified\nand progress has been made towards developing novel solutions.\n</p> \n <p>The main research question that this seminar aims to address is: <b>How to collect, analyze, and summarize provenance information to support the design and evaluation of novel techniques for sense making across related fields</b>. The week-long seminar started with a day of self-introduction, lighting talks, and research topic brain storming. The self-introduction allowed attendees to know each other better, and the lighting talks covered the latest work in the research fields related to provenance. Each participant proposed several research questions, which were then collated and voted on to form the\nbreakout groups. The following are the research areas chosen by the participants:\n</p> <ul>\n<li>Storytelling and narrative;\n</li><li>Provenance standard and system integration;\n</li><li>Task abstraction for provenance analysis;\n</li><li>Machine learning and provenance;\n</li><li>User modeling and intent.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The rest of the week was breakout session, and each participant had the option to change group halfway. The seminar finished with a presentation from each group and discussions on the next steps to continue the collaboration. Many interesting problems were identified, and progress was made towards new solutions. Please refer to the rest of the report for the details on the identified research questions and the progress made by the end of week.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Melanie Herschel and Marcel Hlawatsch.

            "title": "Logic and Random Discrete Structures",
            "data": "\n <h4>Topic and Goals of the Seminar</h4> \n <p>\nThe analysis of large random discrete structures, such as trees, graphs, or permutations, is a focus of research in contemporary discrete mathematics. Logic provides a useful and powerful formalism for expressing and classifying discrete structures; moreover, it is intimately linked to the study of algorithms, computational complexity, and structural graph theory. Over the past several decades, researchers have studied random discrete structures from a logical perspective. The first significant result in this direction was the zero-one law for first-order logic under the uniform measure; this seminal result, was followed by the discovery of \u2018logical limit laws\u2019 or \u2018convergence laws\u2019 for several different models of random discrete structures and for various logics of significance in computer science.\nIn more recent years, a renewed impetus has emerged for research activity on random discrete structures from a logical perspective. This is in part due to the availability of new methods and techniques, including asymptotic enumeration, discrete harmonic analysis, an extension of Gowers norms, and limit structures. Exciting new results on random geometric graphs, graphs on surfaces, classes of sparse graphs, graph limits, and flag algebras have been established. On the computer science side, there has been a systematic exploration of probabilistic databases, which has brought together databases, logic, and random structures.\nThe main aim of this seminar has been to bring together some of the foremost experts from these different fields, as well as junior researchers who may become motivated to work deeper in the frontier of logic and random structures. In addition to making tangible progress on some of the currently outstanding open problems in this area, we wanted to establish new connections between (classical) random discrete structures, flag algebras, and sparse graph limits, both in terms of identifying new research questions and embarking on new collaborations, as well as fruitful interaction between foundational research and different application areas, including probabilistic databases.\n\n</p> \n <h4>Organisation and Activities</h4> \n <p>\nDespite the restrictions and problems caused by corona pandemic, the seminar had originally been intended\nas a non-hybrid event with all participants on site. At the end, however, this turned out to be infeasible; as a result, two of the invited survey talks and a  number of the contributed talks  had to be given remotely via Zoom.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers created a schedule consisting of four invited one-hour survey talks, and more focussed regular contributions proposed by the participants.\nThe survey talks were given by\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Albert Atserias on certifying the chromatic number of a random graph;\n</li><li> Fiona Skerman on the inference of underlying community structures in partially observed graphs;\n</li><li> Dan Suciu on probabilistic databases; \n</li><li> Patrice Ossona de Mendez on limits of graphs.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe talks of Fiona Skerman and  Patrice Ossona de Mendez were given over Zoom.\n</p> \n <p>In addition, there were 18 contributed talks, 11 of which were given on site, and 7 remotely via Zoom.\n</p> \n <p>Overall, the organisers regard the seminar to have been a very successful scientific event.\nThere was a general view shared by all participants\nthat the community working on logic and random structures is in excellent shape, with interesting new developments and\nexciting results in many different directions.\nThe participants clearly expressed the wish to a have a future meeting of this community,\nbe in in Dagstuhl or elsewhere, within the next two to three years.\n</p> \n <p>The organisers are grateful to the Scientific Directorate and to the staff of\nthe Center for their support of this seminar.\n\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Erich Gr\u00e4del, Phokion G.

            "title": "From Theory to Practice of Algebraic Effects and Handlers",
            "data": "\n <p>\nBeing no strangers to the Dagstuhl seminars we were delighted to get the opportunity to organize Seminar 16112. Our seminar was dedicated to algebraic effects and handlers, a research topic in programming languages which has received much attention in the past decade. There are strong theoretical and practical aspects of algebraic effects and handlers, so we invited people from both camps. It would have been easy to run the seminar as a series of disconnected talks that would take up most of people's schedules - we have\nall been to such seminars - and run the risk of disconnecting the camps as well. We decided to try a different format, and would like to share our experience in this executive summary.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the first day we set out to identify topics of interest and organize working groups around them. This did not work, as everybody wanted to be in every group, or was at least worried they would miss something important by choosing the wrong group. Nevertheless, we did identify topics and within them ideas began to form. At first they were very general ideas on the level of major research projects, but soon enough people started asking specific questions that could be addressed at the seminar. Around those questions small groups began to form. Out of initial confusion came self-organization.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe had talks each day in the morning, with the schedule planned two days ahead, except for the first day which started by a tutorial on algebraic effects and handlers. We left the afternoons completely free for people to work in self-organized groups, which they did. The organizers subtly made sure that everybody had a group to talk to. In the evening, just before dinner, we had a \"show &amp; tell\" session in which groups reported on their progress. These sessions were the most interesting part of the day, with everyone  participating: some showing what they had done so far, and others offering new ideas. Some of the sessions were accompanied by improvised short lectures.\n</p> \n <p>\nWork continued after dinner and late at night. One of the organizers was shocked to find, on his way to bed, that the walls of a small seminar room were completely filled with type theoretic formulas, from the floor to the ceiling. He was greatly relieved to hear that the type theory was not there to stay permanently as the Dagstuhl caretakers painted the walls with a special \"whiteboard\" paint. They should sell the paint by the bucket as a\nDagstuhl souvenir.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe are extremely happy with the outcome of the seminar and the way we organized it. An open format that gives everyone ample time outside the seminar room was significantly boosted by the unique Dagstuhl environment free of worldly distractions. We encourage future organizers to boldly try new ways of organizing meetings. There will be confusion at first, but as long as the participants are encouraged and allowed to group themselves, they will do so. If a lesson is to be taken from our seminar, it is perhaps this: let people do what they want, but also make sure they report frequently on what they are\ndoing, preferably when they are a bit hungry.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andrej Bauer, Martin Hofmann, Matija Pretnar, and Jeremy Yallop\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis is the executive summary of Dagstuhl 22102: Computational Models of Human-Automated Vehicle Interaction, which took place March 6-11th 2022 in Hybrid format. The executive summary first summarizes the motivation of the seminar, then gives an overview of the broad challenges that were discussed, it then presents the results of the seminar. As this is only the summary, there are a lot more details about every item and result in other parts of this report, these are therefore referred to. \n</p> \n <p>\nIt has been a fruitful meeting, which sparked many research ideas.

We hope that it is of value to the community, and we can't wait to see what other results follow in the future based on discussions that started at this seminar!\n</p> \n <p>\nChristian Janssen, Martin Baumann, Antti Oulasvirta, and Shamsi Iqbal (organizers)\n</p> \n <h3>Computational Models of Human-Automated Vehicle Interaction: Summary of the field</h3> \n <p>\nThe capabilities of automated vehicles are rapidly increasing, and are changing human interaction considerably (e.g., [4, 6, 29]). Despite this technological progress, the path to fully self-driving vehicles without any human intervention is long, and for the foreseeable future human interaction is still needed with automated vehicles (e.g., [15, 22, 29, 37, 48, 47]). The principles of human-automation interaction also guide the future outlook of the European\nCommission [13, 14]. Human-automated vehicle interaction can take at least two forms. One form is a partnership, in which the human and the automated vehicle both contribute in parallel to the control of the vehicle. Another form is in transitions of control, where the automated system at times takes over full control of the vehicle, but transitions control back to the human when desired by the human, or when required due to system limitations. For both the partnership and the transition paradigm it is beneficial when the car and the\nhuman have a good model of each other\u2019s capabilities and limitations. Accurate models can make clear how tasks are distributed between the human and the machine. This helps avoid misunderstandings, or mode confusion [45], and thereby reduces the likelihood of accidents and incidents. A key tool in this regard is the use of computational (cognitive) models: computational instantiations that simulate the human thought process and/or their interaction with an automated vehicle. Computational models build on a long tradition in\ncognitive science (e.g., [35, 36, 44]), human factors and human-computer interaction (e.g., [10, 39, 27], neuroscience (e.g., [12, 31]), and AI and engineering (e.g., [17, 42]). By now, there are a wide set of varieties that can be applied to different domains, ranging from constrained theoretical problems to capturing real-world interaction [38]. Computational models have many benefits. They enforce a working ethic of \u201cunderstanding by building\u201d and require precision in specification ([34], see also [8, 32, 41]). Models can test the impact of changes in parameters and assumptions, which allows for wider applicability and scalability (e.g., [2, 16, 44]). More generally, this allows for testing \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. For human-automated vehicle interaction in particular, it allows testing of future adaptive systems that are not yet\non the road. Automated driving is a domain where computational models can be applied. Three approaches have only started to scratch the surface. First, the large majority of models focus on engineering aspects (e.g., computer vision, sensing the environment, flow of traffic) that do not consider the human extensively (e.g., [7, 18, 33]). Second, models that focus on the human mostly capture manual, non-automated driving (e.g., [44, 9, 25]). Third, models about human interaction in automated vehicles are either conceptual (e.g. [20, 22]) or qualitative, and do not benefit from the full set of advantages that computational models offer. In summary, there is a disconnect between the power and capabilities that computational models offer for the domain of automated driving, and today\u2019s state-of-the-art research. This is due to a set of broad challenges that the field is facing and that need to be tackled over the next 3-10 years, which we will discuss next.\n</p> \n <h3>Description of the seminar topics and structure of the seminar report</h3> \n <p>The seminar topics were clustered around five broad challenges, for which we provide a brief description and example issues that were discussed addressed. Although the challenges are presented separately, they are interconnected and were discussed in an integrated manner during the seminar. During the seminar, each challenge was discussed in a panel, with all attendees taking part in at least one panel. After each panel, the group was split up in smaller workgroups, and discussed the themes in more lengths. The summary of each panel discussion can be found later in this report under the section \"panel discussions\". The outcomes of the workgroups can be found later in this report under the section \"workgroups\". In addition, all attendees wrote short abstracts that summarized their individual position.\n</p> \n <h4>Challenge 1: How can models inform design and governmental policy?</h4> \n <p>Models are most useful if they are more than abstract, theoretical vehicles. They should not live in a vacuum, but be related to problems and issues in the real world. Therefore, we want to explicitly discuss how models can inform the design of (in-)vehicle technology, and how they can inform policy. As both of these topics can fill an entire Dagstuhl by themselves, our primary objective is to identify the most pressing issues and opportunities. For example, looking at:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Types of questions</em>: what types of questions exist at a design and policy level about human-automated vehicle interaction?\n</li><li><em>How to inform decisions</em>: How can models be used to inform design and policy decisions? What level of detail is needed here? What are examples of good practices?\n</li><li><em>Integration</em>: Integration can be considered in multiple ways. First, how can ideas from different disciplines be integrated (e.g., behavioral sciences, engineering, economics), even if they have at times opposing views (e.g., monetary gains versus accuracy and rigor)? Second, how can models become better integrated in the design and development process as tools to evaluate prototypes (instead of running empirical tests)? And third, how can models be integrated into the automation (e.g., as a user model) to broaden the automation functionality (e.g., prediction of possible driver actions, time needed to take over)?\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Challenge 2: What phenomena and driving scenarios need to be captured?</h4> \n <p>\nThe aim here is to both advance theory on human-automation interaction while also contributing to understanding realistic case studies for human-automation interaction that are faced for example by industry and governments. The following are example phenomena:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Transitions of control and dynamic attention</em>: When semi-automated vehicles transition control of the car back to the human, they require accurate estimates of a user\u2019s attention level and capability to take control (e.g., [22, 49]).\n</li><li><em>Mental models, machine models, mode confusion, and training and skill</em>: Models can be used to estimate human\u2019s understanding of the machine and vice-versa (e.g., [20]). Similarly, they might be used to estimate a human driver\u2019s skill level, and whether training is desired.\n</li><li><em>Shared control</em>: In all these scenarios, there is some form of shared control. Shared control requires a mutual understanding of human and automation. Computational models can be used to provide such understanding for the automation (e.g., [50]).\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Challenge 3: What technical capabilities do computational models possess?</h4> \n <p>A second challenge has to do with the technical capabilities of the models. Although the nature of different modeling frameworks and different studies might differ [38], what do we consider the core functionality? For example, related to:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Compatibility</em>: To what degree do models need to be compatible with simulator software (e.g., to test a \u201cvirtual participant\u201d), hardware (e.g., be able to drive a car on a test track), and other models of human thinking?\n</li><li><em>Adaptive nature</em>: Computational models aim to strike a balance between precise predictions for more static environments and being able to handle open-ended dynamic environments (like everyday traffic). How can precision be guaranteed in static and dynamic environments? How can models adapt to changing circumstances?\n</li><li><em>Speed of development and broader adoption</em>: The development of computational models requires expertise and time. How can development speed be improved? How can communities benefit from each other\u2019s expertise?\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Challenge 4: How can models benefit from advances in AI while avoiding pitfalls?</h4> \n <p>At the moment there are many developments in AI that computational models can benefit from. Three examples are advances in (1) simulator-based inference (e.g., [26]) to reason about possible future worlds (e.g., varieties of traffic environments), (2) reinforcement learning [46] and its application to robotics [30] and human driving [25], and (3) deep learning [17] and its potential to predict driver state or behavior from sensor data. At the same time,\nincorporation of AI techniques also comes with challenges that need to be addressed. For example:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Explainability</em>: Machine learning techniques are good at classifying data, but do not always provide insight into why classifications are made. This limits their explainability and is at odds with the objective of computational models to gain insight into human behavior. How can algorithms\u2019 explainability be improved?\n</li><li><em>Scalability and generalization</em>: How can models be made that are scalable to other domains and that are not overtrained on specific instances? How can they account for future scenarios where human behavior might be hard to predict [5]?\n</li><li><em>System training and corrective feedback</em>: if models are trained on a dataset, what is the right level of feedback to correct an incorrect action to the model? How can important new instances and examples be given more weight to update the model\u2019s understanding without biasing the impact?\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Challenge 5: What insights are needed for and from empirical research?</h4> \n <p>Models are only as good to the degree as they can describe and predict phenomena in the real world. Therefore, empirical tests are an important consideration. Example considerations are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Capturing behavioral change and long-term phenomena</em>: Many current computational models capture the results of a single experiment. However, behavior might change with more exposure to and experience with automated technology. How can such (long-term) behavior change be tested?\n</li><li><em>Capturing unknown future scenarios</em>: Many automated technologies that might benefit from computational models are not yet commercially available. How can these best be studied and connected to computational models?\n</li><li><em>Simulated driving versus real-world encounters</em>: To what degree are simulator tests representative of real-world scenarios (e.g., [19])?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Results</h3> \n <p>The seminar has generated the following results.</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Overview of state-of-the-art technologies, methods, and models.</b> The spectrum of computational modeling techniques is large [38, 21, 24]. Before and during the conference, we have discussed various methods and techniques. In particular, this report contains a dedicated chapter called \u201cRelevant papers for modeling human-automated vehicle interaction\u201d in which we report a long set of papers that the community identified as being relevant to the field. We encourage scholars to take a look at it.\n</li><li><b>List of grand challenges with solution paths.</b> We have identified five grand challenges and discussed those in detail during the panels. Our chapters on \u201cpanel discussions\u201d report the outcomes of these discussions. Moreover, the workgroups further report the in-depth discussions that smaller groups had about these challenges. See the section \u201cworking group\u201d of this report. The results only start to scratch the surface of some of the grand challenges for the application of computational cognitive modeling that need to\nbe faced within the next 3 to 10 years, and their paths to solutions. Based on discussions, groups of authors plan to work on more papers and workshops around topics that they deemed worthy of further discussion. For example, we discussed whether there are specific driving scenarios that a computational model should be able to capture, and how success might be quantified (e.g., whether these challenges should take the form of competitions, akin to DARPA\u2019s Grand Challenge for automated vehicles [11] or \u201cNewell\u2019s test\u201d for cognitive models [3]).\n</li><li><b>Research agenda to further the field.</b> This report also reports a research agenda that is intended to further the field. For each specific grand challenge, we have identified more specific areas of research that need futher exploration. We refer to the dedicated section in this report called \u201cResearch agenda to further the field\u201d. The organizers of the seminar will also organize a dedicated journal special issue around the topic, in which further results that arose from the seminar can be reported.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Amershi, S., Weld, D., Vorvoreanu, M., Fourney, A., Nushi, B., Collisson, P., Iqbal, S.T., and Teevan, J.

            "data": "\n <h3>Overview and Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>Engineering robustness into systems under development has always been\nat the heart of good engineering practice, be it robustness against manufacturing tolerances and against variations in purity of construction materials in mechanical engineering, robustness against concentrations of educts in chemical engineering, against parameter variations in the plant model within control engineering, against\nquantization and measurement noise in signal processing, against faults in computer architecture, against attacks in security engineering, or against unexpected inputs or results in programming. In cyber-physical systems (CPS), all the aforementioned\nengineering disciplines meet, as the digital networking and embedded control involved in CPS brings many kinds of physical processes into the sphere of human and computer control. This convergence of disciplines has proven extremely fruitful in the past, inspiring profound research on hybrid and distributed control, transferring notions and methods for safety verification from computer science to control theory, transferring proof methods for stability from control theory to computer science,\nand shedding light on the complex interplay of control objectives and security threats, to name just a few of the many interdisciplinary breakthroughs achieved\nover the past two decades. Unfortunately, a joint, interdisciplinary approach to robustness remains evasive. While most researchers in the field of CPS concede that unifying notions across the disciplinary borders to reflect the close functional dependencies between heterogeneous components would be of utmost importance, the\ncurrent state of affairs is a fragmentary coverage by the aforementioned\ndisciplinary notions.\n</p> \n <h4>Synergies and research questions</h4> \n <p>The seminar set out to close the gap in the robustness\ninvestigations across the overlapping disciplines under the umbrella\nof CPS by gathering scientists from the entire spectrum of fields\ninvolved in the development of cyber-physical systems and their\npertinent design theories. The seminar fostered interdisciplinary\nresearch answering the following central questions:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>What is the rationale behind the plethora of existing notions of robustness and how are they related?\n</li><li> What measures have to be taken in a particular design domain (e.g., embedded software design) to be faithful to notions of robustness central to another domain it has functional impact on (e.g., feedback control)?\n</li><li> What forms of correctness guarantees are provided by the different notions of robustness and would there be potential for unification or synergy?\n</li><li> What design measures have been established by different disciplines for achieving robustness by construction, and how can they be lifted to other disciplines?\n</li><li> Where do current notions of robustness or current techniques of system design fall short and can this be alleviated by adopting ideas from related disciplines?\n</li></ol> \n <p>The overarching objective of such research would be to establish\ntrusted engineering approaches incorporating methods for producing\ncyber-physical system designs\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>that sustain their correctness and performance guarantees even when used in a well-defined vicinity of their nominal operational regimes, and\n</li><li> that can be trusted to degrade gracefully even when some of the underlying modeling and analysis assumptions turn out to be false.\n</li></ol> \n <p>To satisfy these design objectives, we require notions of robustness that go well beyond the classical impurities of embedded systems, like sampling,\nmeasurement noise, jitter, and machine tolerances, and must draw on concepts of robustness from disparate fields. This seminar identified parallels between related notions of robustness from the many varied domains related to CPS design and\nbridged the divide between disciplines, with the goal of achieving the above \nobjectives.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics of the seminar</h3> \n <p>This seminar aimed to identify fundamental similarities and distinctions between various notions of robustness and accompanying design and analysis methods, with the goal of bringing together disparate notions of robustness from  multiple academic disciplines and application domains. The following is a brief compendium of the robustness notions and application domains that were addressed in\nthis seminar. \n</p> \n <h4>Robustness Notions and Design/Analysis Methods</h4> \n <p>One goal of this seminar was to identify crosscutting frameworks and\ndesign methodologies among the different approaches used to study robustness in the domains of control theory, computer science, and mechanical engineering. We considered the following broad classifications of robustness with the ultimate goal of synergizing the notions and techniques from the various disciplines.</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Input/Output Robustness\n</li><li>\tRobustness with respect to system parameters\n</li><li>\tRobustness in real-time system implementation\n</li><li>\tRobustness due to unpredictable environments\n</li><li>\tRobustness to Faults\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Application Domains</h4> \n <p>The applications for the topics addressed in this seminar include cyber-physical systems for which robustness is a vital concern. The following is a partial list of these application domains.</p> \n <h3>Outcome</h3> \n <p>We summarize the outcomes of the discussions in the break-out sessions that were conducted by forming subgroups among the participants. The topics referred to different approaches and/or applications in the framework of robustness.\nOne of the topics was about robustness for discrete systems. In this session, the need for defining robustness for these systems was extensively discussed, and one of the most relevant challenges identified was to define appropriate metrics on the state-space relevant to the application. Also some specific robustness issues in the domain of medical devices and automotive systems were identified.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother discussion was about guaranteeing robust performance from systems based on machine learning. This issue is a difficult task and it is growing in importance as many new safety critical applications, such as self-driving cars, are being designed using machine learning techniques. A challenge is to develop reliable methodologies for certifying or designing for robust performance for systems based on machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nDiscussions in a third break-out group were centered around the issue of established engineering means for obtaining robustness by design and how to accommodate these in rigorous safety cases or formal proofs of correctness. A finding was that most formal models would currently require rather low-level coding of the dynamic behavior of such mechanisms, thereby requiring them to be re-evaluated on each new design rather than exploiting their guaranteed properties to simplify system analysis, which would be in line with their actual impact on engineering processes.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Fr\u00e4nzle, James Kapinski, and Pavithra Prabhakar\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Beyond-Planar Graphs: Algorithmics and Combinatorics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nRelational data sets, containing a set of objects and relations between them, are commonly modeled by graphs/networks, with the objects as the vertices and the relations as the edges. A great deal is known about the structure and properties of special types of graphs, in particular <em>planar graphs</em>. The class of planar graphs is fundamental for both Graph Theory and Graph Algorithms, and extensively studied. Many structural properties of planar graphs are known and these properties can be used in the development of efficient algorithms for planar graphs, even where the more general problem is NP-hard. \n</p> \n <p>\nMost real world graphs, however, are <em>non-planar</em>. In particular, many scale-free networks, which can be used to model web-graphs, social networks and biological networks, consists of sparse non-planar graphs. To analyze and visualize such real-world networks, we need to solve fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research questions on <em>sparse non-planar</em> graphs, which we call <em>beyond-planar graphs</em>. The notion of beyond-planar graphs has been established as non-planar graphs with topological constraints such as specific types of crossings or with some forbidden crossing patterns, although it has not been formally defined. Examples of beyond-planar graphs include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>k-planar</em> graphs: graphs which can be embedded with at most k crossings per edge.\n</li><li><em>k-quasi-planar</em> graphs: graphs which can be embedded without k mutually crossing edges.\n</li><li><em>bar k-visibility</em> graphs: graphs whose vertices are represented as horizontal segments (bars) and edges  as vertical lines connecting bars, intersecting at most k other bars.\n</li><li><em>fan-crossing-free</em> graphs: graphs which can be embedded without fan-crossings.\n</li><li><em>fan-planar</em> graphs: graphs which can be embedded with crossings sharing the common vertices.\n</li><li><em>RAC (Right Angle Crossing)</em> graphs: a graph which has a straight-line drawing with right angle crossings.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe aim of the seminar was to bring together world-renowned researchers in graph algorithms, computational geometry and graph theory, and collaboratively develop a research agenda for the study of beyond-planar graphs. The plan was to work on specific open problems about the structure, topology, and geometry of beyond-planar graphs. One of the outcomes of the workshop might be an annotated bibliography of this new field of study. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn Sunday afternoon, 29 participants met at Dagstuhl for an informal get-together. Fortunately, there were no cancelations and everybody who registered was able to attend. On Monday morning, the workshop officially kicked off. After a round of introductions, where we discovered that eight participants were first-time Dagstuhl attendees, we enjoyed three overview talks about beyond-planar graphs from three different points of view. First, G\u00e9za T\u00f3th from the R\u00e9nyi Institute in Budapest talked about the combinatorics of beyond-planar graphs in connection to graph theory. Next, Giuseppe Liotta from the University of Perugia gave an overview about the connections between graph drawing and beyond-planar graphs and presented a taxonomy of related topics and questions.\nFinally, Alexander Wolff from the University of W\u00fcrzburg discussed beyond-planar graphs in the context of geometry and geometric graph representations.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn Monday afternoon, we had lively open problem sessions, where we collected 20 problems covering the most relevant topics. The participants split into four groups based on common interest in subsets of the open problems. The last three days of the seminar were dedicated to working group efforts. Most of the groups kept their focus on the original problems as stated in the open problem session, while one group modified and expanded the problems; see Section 4. We had two progress reports sessions, including one on Friday morning, where group leaders were officially designated and plans for follow-up work were made. Work from one of the groups has been submitted to an international conference, and we expect further research publications to result directly from the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nArguably the best, and most-appreciated, feature of the seminar was the opportunity to engage in discussion and interactions with experts in various fields with shared passion about graphs, geometry and combinatorics.  We received very positive feedback from the participants (e.g., scientific quality: 10.5/11, inspired new ideas: 23/25, inspired joint projects: 21/25) and it is our impression that the participants enjoyed the unique scientific atmosphere at the seminar and benefited from the scientific program. \nIn summary, we regard the seminar as a success, and we are grateful for having had the opportunity to organize it and take this opportunity to thank the scientific, administrative, and technical staff at Schloss Dagstuhl. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Seok-Hee Hong, Michael Kaufmann, Stephen G.

            "title": "The Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Complexity and Approximability",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe <em>constraint satisfaction problem</em>, or CSP in short, provides a unifying framework in which it is possible to express, in a natural way, a wide variety of computational problems dealing with mappings and assignments, including satisfiability, graph/hypergraph colorability, and systems of equations. The CSP framework originated around 40 years ago independently in artificial intelligence, database theory, and graph theory, under three different guises, and it was realised only in the late 1990s that these are in fact different faces of the same fundamental problem. Nowadays, the CSP is extensively used in theoretical computer science, being a mathematical object offering a good balance between generality and structure that provides an excellent laboratory both for classification methods and for algorithmic techniques, while in AI and\nmore applied areas of computer science this framework is widely regarded as a versatile and efficient way of modelling and solving a variety of real-world problems, such as planning and scheduling, software verification and natural language comprehension, to name just a few. An instance of CSP consists of a set of variables, a set of values for the variables, and a set of constraints that restrict the combinations of values that certain subsets of variables may take. Given such an instance, the possible questions include (a) deciding  whether there is an assignment of values to the variables so that every constraint is satisfied, or optimising such assignments in various ways, or (b) finding an assignment satisfying as many constraints as possible. There are many important modifications and extensions of this basic framework, e.g., those that deal with counting assignments or involve soft or global constraints.\n</p> \n <p>\nConstraint satisfaction has always played a central role in computational complexity theory; appropriate versions of CSPs are classical complete problems for most standard complexity classes. CSPs constitute a rich and yet sufficiently manageable class of problems to give a good perspective on general computational phenomena. For instance, they help to understand which mathematical properties make a problem tractable (in a wide sense, e.g., polynomial-time solvable or non-trivially approximable, fixed-parameter tractable or definable in a weak logic). One of the most striking features of this study is the variety of different branches of mathematics (including universal algebra and logic, combinatorics and graph theory, probability theory and mathematical programming) that are used to achieve deep insights into CSP, and this Dagstuhl Seminar aims to contribute towards further synergy in the area.\n</p> \n <p>\nAfter about 15 years of intense research activity and hugely impressive\nprogress, the culmination of the algebraic-approach to fixed-template CSPs was\nthe resolution of the Feder-Vardi conjecture independently by Bulatov and Zhuk\nin 2017. While some fundamental questions (such as a fine-grained understanding\nof tractable CSPs) remain open, new research directions on generalizations of\nCSPs started emerging. The fixed-template promise CSP (PCSP) is among the most\npromising new directions of research motivated by better understanding\ncomputational hardness or tractability. PCSPs are a vast generalization of CSPs\nwhere each predicate has a strong and a weak form and given a CSP instance, the\nobjective is to distinguish if the strong form can be satisfied vs. even the\nweak form cannot be satisfied. A prime and well-known example is the approximate\ngraph coloring problem: distinguish k-colorable graphs from graphs that are not\neven \u2113-colorable, for some fixed k&lt;\u2113. The main topic of this seminar is PCSPs,\na highly ambitious research direction with intriguing connections to both old\nopen problems (such as the approximate graph coloring problem) and new research\ndirections (such as generalizations of submodularity, a key concept in\noptimization).\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Concluding remarks and future plans.</b> The seminar was well received as witnessed by the high rate of accepted invitations and the great degree of involvement by the participants. Because of a multitude of  impressive results reported during the seminar and active discussions between researchers with different expertise areas, the organisers regard this seminar as a great success. With steadily increasing interactions\nbetween such researchers, we foresee another seminar focusing on the interplay between different approaches to studying the complexity and approximability of the CSP. Finally, the organisers wish to express their gratitude to the Scientific Directors of the Dagstuhl Centre for their support of the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Description of the Topics of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nWith the resolution of the Feder-Vardi conjecture on finite-domain CSPs by Bulatov and Zhuk in 2017, the field has moved on to more generalizations of finite-domain decision CSPs. One of the main emerging areas is that of Promise CSPs (PCSPs), which are a huge generalization of CSPs.\n</p> \n <h4>Promise CSPs</h4> \n <p>\nThe study of PCSPs is about approximability of perfectly satisfiable instances.\nThis exciting area been the main theme of this workshop, with about half of the\ntalks on PCSPs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe workshop started with a 2-hour tutorial on the basics of PCSPs.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> In the first part, Opr\u0161al talked about basic tools used in the\n    complexity analysis of PCSPs, namely minions and free structures.</li>\n<li> In the second part, Opr\u0161al talked about an application of topology\n    in the study of complexity of graph colorings.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThere were three topologists attending the seminar and one of them\ngave a talk.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Kozlov gave a talk on uses of topology in theoretical computer science\n    and homomorphism questions in particular.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>There were 9 contributed talks on recent results on PCSPs.</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Barto talked about his work on \"baby PCP\", which is a\n    combinatorial variant of a (weaker version of) the PCP theorem.</li>\n<li> Brakensiek gave two talks: one on minions related to SDP relaxations\n    for PCSPs, and one on very recent results on robust solvability of certain\n    PCSPs.</li>\n<li> Butti gave a talk about Sherali-Adams relaxations for valued PCSPs.</li>\n<li> Ciardo gave a talk about Sherali-Adams relaxations for PCSPs, and more\n    generally about studying hierarchies of convex relaxations via\n    tensorisation.</li>\n<li> Dalmau gave a talk about his work on a condition that PCSPs\n    solvable by local consistency algorithms have to satisfy.</li>\n<li> Kompatscher gave an overview of existing results on finite tractability\n    of PCSPs.</li>\n<li> Mottet gave a talk about his very recent work on first-order definable\n    PCSPs and a relationship to PCSPs solved by local consistency algorithms.</li>\n<li> Nakajima gave a talk on the complexity of linearly-ordered colorings.</li>\n</ul> \n <h4>Approximability of CSPs</h4> \n <p>\nThe second main theme of the seminar was recent progress in the area of approximability of CSPs. This part of the programme started with a 2-hour tutorial: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Tulsiani gave a tutorial on how to approximate CSPs via the Sum of\n    Squares hierarchy of SDP relaxations, including related work on\n    high-dimensional expanders.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThree participants gave talks on approximability of CSPs.</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Bhangale gave a talk on approximability of solvable linear equations over non-Abelian groups.</li>\n<li> Kothari presented a refutation algorithm for unsatisfiable instances of SAT and CSP.</li>\n<li> Potechin talked about an algorithm for Max NAE-SAT with clauses of lengths 3 and 5.</li>\n</ul> \n <h4>Infinite-domain CSPs</h4> \n <p>\nThe area of infinite-domain CSPs has seen some exciting progress in last few\nyears with new techniques being developed. </p> \n <ul>\n<li> Bodirsky talked about methods for transferring complexity classification result between different classes of infinite-domain CSPs.</li>\n<li> Nagy talked about the complexity of CSPs over random hypergraphs.</li>\n<li> Pinsker gave an overview of recent developments around the dichotomy conjecture for infinite-domain CSPs.</li>\n</ul> \n <h4>Generalisations of CSPs</h4> \n <p>\nThere are several interesting research directions related to CSPs, including the\nnumber of solutions, CSPs with a bound on the number of occurrences for each\nvariable, quantified CSPs, a generalisation to the ideal membership problem,\netc. The seminar featured 5 talks on these topics.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Austrin presented an algorithmic lowerbound for perfect matching on random graphs, a canonical example of an edge CSP.</li>\n<li> Bulatov gave a talk the ideal membership problem.</li>\n<li> Chen presented his results on property testing of homomorphism inadmissibility.</li>\n<li> Kazeminia presented a classification of counting graph homomorphism modulo 2.</li>\n<li> Zhuk presented a complexity classification of quantified CSPs.</li>\n</ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Grohe, Venkatesan Guruswami, D\u00e1niel Marx, and Stanislav \u017divn\u00fd\n                </div> \n",

Martin's vision and ideas have shaped our community and the way resource analysis is performed and thought about. We are grateful for the time we spent with him and we will sorely miss his ingenuity, kindness, and enthusiasm.\n</em>\n</p> \n <p>There are great research opportunities in combining the three aforementioned approaches to resource bound analysis.  The goal of the Dagstuhl seminar was to bring together leading researchers with different backgrounds in these three areas to address challenging open problems and to facilitate communication across research areas. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo this end, the program included seven tutorials on state-of-the-art techniques in the different communities, and short talks on concrete topics with potential for cross\u2013fertilization. This included combining WCET analysis with higher-level bound analysis techniques, hardware-specific refinement of high-level cost models, and interaction of resource analysis with compilation. Additionally, the seminar included two tools sessions: the first was a presentation of the aiT tool of AbsInt by Simon Wegener; the second was a session with presentations of different tools from different participants. Finally, the seminar included a discussion on open problems in the different areas as well as open problems for cross-fertilization.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe tutorials, the talks solicited from the participants, and the tool and discussion sessions allowed us to identify topics which are of common interest to the three different communities. Some of these topics are \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> invariant and flow analysis, \n</li><li> constraint solving and \n</li><li> formalisms and logics for resource bounds.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Supporting information about program invariants and the possible control flow are often required by a resource analysis, e.g., the maximal value of a loop counter, or the infeasibility of a program path. The actual resource analysis is often reduced to solving a constraint system, e.g., using techniques from linear programming or recurrence equations. Verification logics for resource bounds as well as programming language formalisms are of common interest as they allow to specify or to guarantee that a program satisfies a required worst case resource bound. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe that the further study of these topics promises to increase the connections and to leverage the synergies between the different communities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marco Gaboardi, Jan Hoffmann, Reinhard Wilhelm, and Florian Zuleger\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nIn recent years, various concepts of enumeration have arisen in the\nfields of Databases, Computational Logic, and Algorithms, motivated by\napplications of data analysis and query evaluation.  Common to all\nconcepts is the desire to compute a stream of items with as small as\npossible waiting time between consecutive items, referred to as the\n\"delay.\" Alongside each concept, there evolved algorithmic\ntechniques for developing solvers, and proof techniques for\nestablishing complexity bounds.  In addition to the traditional\nguarantees of \"polynomial delay\" and \"incremental polynomial,\"\nresearchers have been pursuing stronger guarantees such as \"constant\ndelay\" in the context of logical query evaluation, \"dynamic\ncomplexity\" of incremental maintenance, and \"factorized databases.\"\nThe growing interest and rapid evolution of the associated research\nbrings up opportunities of significantly accelerating the computation\nof big results, by devising and adopting general-purpose\nmethodologies.\n</p> \nIn Dagstuhl Seminar 19211 on \u201cEnumeration in Data Management,\u201d key researchers from relevant communities have gathered to gain a better understanding the recent developments, lay out the important open problems, and join forces towards solutions thereof.

            "title": "Computational Music Structure Analysis",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIn this executive summary, we start with a short introduction to computational\nmusic structure analysis and then summarize the main topics and questions raised\nin this seminar. Furthermore, we briefly describe the background of the\nseminar's participants, the various activities, and  the overall organization.\nFinally, we reflect on the most important aspects of this seminar and\nconclude with future implications and acknowledgments.\n</p> \n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nOne of the attributes distinguishing music from other types of\nmultimedia data and general sound sources are the rich, intricate, and\nhierarchical structures inherently organizing notated and performed music.\nOn the lowest level, one may have sound events such as individual notes,\nwhich are characterized by the way they sound, i.e., their timbre, pitch\nand duration. Such events form larger structures such as\nmotives, phrases, and chords, and these elements again form larger\nconstructs that determine the overall layout of the composition.\nThis higher structural level is specified in terms of musical parts and\ntheir mutual relations. The general goal of <em>music structure analysis</em>\nis to segment or decompose  music into patterns or units that possess some semantic relevance and then to group these units into musically meaningful categories.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile humans often have an intuitive understanding of musical patterns and their relations, it is generally hard to explicitly describe, quantify, and capture musical structures. Because of different organizing principles and the existence of temporal hierarchies,  musical structures can be highly complex and ambiguous. First of all, a temporal segmentation of a musical work may be based on various properties such as homogeneity, repetition, and novelty.\nWhile the musical structure of one piece of music may be explained by repeating melodies, the structure in other pieces may be characterized by a certain instrumentation or tempo. Then, one has to account for different musical dimensions, such as melody, harmony, rhythm, or timbre. For example, in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony the \"fate motive\" is repeated in various ways -- sometimes the motive is shifted in pitch, sometimes only the rhythmic pattern is preserved. Furthermore, the segmentation and structure will depend on the musical context to be considered; in particular, the threshold of similarity may change depending on the timescale or hierarchical level of focus.\nFor example, the recapitulation of a sonata may be considered\na kind of repetition of the exposition on a coarse temporal level\neven though there may be significant modifications in melody and harmony.\nIn addition, the complexity of the problem can depend on how the music is represented. For example, while it is often easy to detect certain structures\nsuch as repeating melodies in symbolic music data, it is often much harder to\nautomatically identify such structures in audio representations.\nFinally, certain structures may emerge only in the aural communication\nof music. For example, grouping structures may be imposed by accent patterns introduced in performance. Hence, such structures are the result of a creative or cognitive process of the performer or listener rather then being an objective, measurable property of the underlying notes of the music.\n</p> \n <h3>Main Topics and Questions</h3> \n <p>In this seminar, we brought together experts from diverse fields including psychology, music theory, composition,\ncomputer science, music technology, and engineering.\nThrough the resulting interdisciplinary discussions, we aimed to better understand\nthe structures that emerge in composition, performance, and listening,\nand how these structures interrelate. For example,\nwhile there are certain structures inherent in the note content of music,\nthe perception and communication of structure are themselves also creative acts subject to interpretation.\nThere may be some structures intended by the composer or improviser,\nwhich are not fully communicated by symbolic descriptions such as musical score notation.\nThe performer, if different from the composer, then must interpret structures from the score,\nand decide on the prosodic means by which to convey them.\nWhen a listener then tries to make sense of the performed piece,\nthat act of sense-making, of constructing structure and meaning from an auditory\nstream is also a creative one. As a result, different people along this communication chain\nmay come up with different solutions, depending on their experiences, their musical backgrounds,\nand their current thinking or mood.\n</p> \n <p>\nBased on our discussions of various principles and aspects that are relevant\nfor defining musical patterns and structures, the following questions were raised.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>In which way do these notions depend on the music style and tradition?\n</li><li> How can one account for the relations within and across different hierarchical levels of structural patterns?\n</li><li> How can long-term structures be built up from short-term patterns, and, vice versa, how can\nthe knowledge of global structural information support the analysis of local events?\n</li><li> How can information on rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, or dynamics be fused within\nunifying structural models?\n</li><li> How can the relevance of these aspects be measured?\n</li><li> How do computational models need to be changed to account for human listeners?\n</li></ul> \n <p>By addressing such fundamental questions, we aimed for a better understanding of the principles and model assumptions on which current computational procedures are based, as well as the identification of the main challenges ahead.</p> \n <p>\nAnother important goal of this seminar was to discuss how computational structure analysis methods may open up novel ways for users to find and access music information in large, unstructured, and distributed multimedia collections. Computational music structure analysis is not just an end in itself; it forms the foundation for many music processing and retrieval applications. Computational methods for structuring and decomposing digitized artifacts into semantically meaningful units are of fundamental importance not only for music content but also for general multimedia content including speech, image, video, and geometric data. Decomposing a complex object into smaller units often constitutes the first step for simplifying subsequent processing and analysis tasks, for deriving compact object descriptions that can be efficiently stored and transmitted, and for opening up novel ways for users to access, search, navigate, and interact with the content. In the music context, many of the current commercially available services for music recommendation and playlist generation employ <em>context-based</em> methods, where textual information (e.g., tags, structured metadata, user access patterns) surrounding the music object are exploited. However, there are numerous data mining problems for which context-based analysis is\ninsufficient, as it tends to be low on specifics and unevenly distributed across artists and styles. In such cases, one requires <em>content-based</em> methods, where the information is obtained directly from the analysis of audio signals, scores and other representations of the music. In this context, the following questions were raised.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How can one represent partial and complex similarity relations within and across music documents?\n</li><li> What are suitable interfaces that allow users to browse, interact, adapt, and understand musical structures?\n</li><li> How can musical structures be visualized?\n</li><li> How can structural information help improve the organizing and indexing of music collections?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Participants, Interaction, Activities</h3> \n <p>In our seminar, we had 31 participants, who came from various\nlocations around the world including North America (8 participants from the U.S.), Asia (2 participants from Japan), and Europe (21 participants from Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom).\nMany of the participants came to Dagstuhl for the first time and expressed enthusiasm about the open and retreat-like atmosphere. Besides its  international character, the seminar was also highly interdisciplinary. While most of the participating researchers are working in the fields of music information retrieval, we have had participants with a background in musicology, cognition, psychology, signal processing, and other fields.\nThis led to the seminar having many cross-disciplinary intersections and provoking discussions as well as numerous social activities including playing music together. One particular highlight of such social activities was a concert on Thursday evening, where various participant-based ensembles performed a wide variety of music including popular music, jazz, and classical music. Some of the performed pieces were original compositions by the seminar's participants.\n</p> \n <h3>Overall Organization and Schedule</h3> \n <p>Dagstuhl seminars are known for having a high degree of flexibility and\ninteractivity, which allows participants to discuss ideas and to raise\nquestions rather than to present research results. Following this tradition, we fixed the schedule during the seminar asking for spontaneous contributions with future-oriented content, thus avoiding a conference-like atmosphere, where the focus tends to be on past research achievements. After the organizers have given an overview of the Dagstuhl concept and the seminar's overall topic,\nwe started the first day with self-introductions, where all participants\nintroduced themselves and expressed their expectations and wishes for the seminar. We then continued with a small number of ten-minute stimulus talks,\nwhere specific participants were asked to address some critical questions\non music structure analysis in a nontechnical fashion. Each of these\ntalks seamlessly moved towards an open discussion among all participants,\nwhere the respective presenters took over the role of a moderator. These discussions were well received and often lasted for more than half an hour. The first day closed with a brainstorming session on central topics covering the participants' interests while shaping the overall schedule and format of our seminar. During the next days, we split into small groups, each group  discussing a more specific topic in greater depth. The results and conclusions of these parallel group sessions, which lasted between 60 to 90 minutes, were then presented to, and discussed with, the plenum. Furthermore, group discussions were interleaved with additional stimulus talks spontaneously given by participants. This mixture of presentation elements gave all participants the opportunity for presenting their ideas to the plenum while avoiding a monotonous conference-like presentation format. Finally, on the last day, the seminar concluded with a session we called \"self-outroductions\" where each participant presented his or her personal view of the main research challenges and the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusions and Aknowledgement</h3> \n <p>Having the Dagstuhl seminar, our aim was to gather researchers from different fields\nincluding information retrieval, signal processing, musicology\nand psychology. This allowed us to approach the problem of music structure analysis by looking at a broad spectrum\nof data analysis techniques (including signal processing, machine learning, probabilistic models, user studies),\nby considering different domains (including text, symbolic, image, audio representations), and\nby drawing inspiration from creative perspectives of the agents (composer, performer, listener) involved.\nAs a key result of this seminar, we achieved some significant progress towards understanding,\nmodeling, representing, extracting, and exploiting musical structures. In particular,\nour seminar contributed to further closing the gap between music theory, cognition, and the computational sciences.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar gave us the opportunity for having interdisciplinary discussions in an inspiring and retreat-like atmosphere. The generation of\nnovel, technically oriented scientific contributions was not the focus\nof the seminar. Naturally, many of the contributions and discussions were\non a rather abstract level, laying the foundations for future projects and\ncollaborations. Thus, the main impact of the seminar is likely to take place\nin the medium to long term. Some more immediate results, such as plans to\nshare research data and software, also arose from the discussions.\nAs measurable outputs from the seminar, we expect to see several joint papers\nand applications for funding.\n</p> \n <p>\nBeside the scientific aspect, the social aspect of our seminar was\njust as important. We had an interdisciplinary, international, and\nvery interactive group of researchers, consisting of leaders and future leaders in our field. Many of our participants were visiting Dagstuhl for the first time and enthusiastically praised the open and inspiring setting.\nThe group dynamics were excellent with many personal exchanges\nand common activities. Some scientists expressed their appreciation for\nhaving the opportunity for prolonged discussions with researchers from\nneighboring research fields -- some thing that which is often impossible during\nconference-like events.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, our expectations of the seminar were not only met but\nexceeded, in particular with respect to networking and community building.\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the Dagstuhl board for giving us the opportunity to organize this seminar, the Dagstuhl office for their exceptional support in the organization process, and the entire Dagstuhl staff for their excellent service during the seminar.\nIn particular, we want to thank Susanne Bach-Bernhard, Roswitha Bardohl, Marc Herbstritt, and Sascha Daeges for their assistance during the preparation and organizing of the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Juan Pablo Bello, Elaine Chew, and Meinard M\u00fcller\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Ambient Notification Environments",
            "data": "\n <p>\nReports indicate that many users interact with their smartphone and wearable devices more than 100 times per day. Oftentimes, these interactions result from direct notifications, presented on the screen or via sounds. New communication applications (e.g. from email to WhatsApp) has increased the frequency of notifications, while social media applications are inherently motivated to entice repeat visits and interactions. The end result is that more and more systems as well as applications compete for the user\u2019s attention using notifications. Projecting this into the future, it is apparent that current implementation schemes that rely on direct notifications will not scale. A simple extrapolation of the rate in notifications suggests that a near future whereby users will only attend to notifications with no time leftover for productive work. Therefore, a radical restructure of notification delivery is necessary - specifically, one that keeps the user in-the-loop without consuming all of the user\u2019s attention. This is a key challenge. If no alternatives to direct notifications can be realized, current visions of ubiquitous computing and smart environments are likely to be unrealistic, given their anticipated undesirability to the end-user.\nIn the Dagstuhl Seminar 17161 \"Ambient Notification Environments\", we looked at how novel approaches to notification delivery can address the above issue. We brought together researchers and experts that understand the technical, psychological, and social aspects of notification systems. This facilitated a broad discussion that was fuelled by the discussants\u2019 joint expertise in mobile and smart home technologies, in ambient sensing and presentation, and psychological models of human attention, to name a few. This discussion brought to the foreground, many of the underlying challenges that deserves further research. On the hand, a technological push in novel communication and smart devices drives an immediacy in user interaction. On the other hand, this will result in a higher demand on human attention. In the current report, we document the diverse approaches that were proposed as an alternative means towards notifications that are more personalized and contextualized, with the express purpose of reducing user effort. \nThe central aim of the seminar was to understand the challenges and questions that we face when designing future interactive systems and to overcome the mounting notification problem. In addition to the ideas raised in the individual presentations and the group sessions, we jointly identified the following research questions and challenges:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>How can notifications be designed to be simultaneously non-intrusive and yet noticeable?\n</li><li> How can artificial intelligence be designed to provide effective context-aware notifications?\n</li><li> What is a suitable notification architecture for integrating user devices, smart (shared) environments, and personal data without compromising personal privacy? \n</li><li> What is a suitable conceptualization for notification systems and how will a taxonomy for classifying notification delivery that is centered on user preferences and privacy look like?\n</li></ol> \n <p>Overall, the seminar contributed to a common vision of how interactions between human and systems can and ought to progress - one where technological progress does not necessitate an ever growing burden on the user\u2019s attention. In this report, we balance an analysis of the underlying drivers and problems, ideas for novel conceptual and technical approach, and  most importantly a set of questions and research challenges in this domain that merit the attention of like-minded researchers. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Albrecht Schmidt\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Visualization of Biological Data \u2013 Crossroads",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe rapidly expanding application of experimental high-throughput and high-resolution methods in biology is creating enormous challenges for the visualization of biological data. To meet these challenges, a large variety of expertise from the visualization, bioinformatics and biology domains is required. These encompass visualization and design knowledge, algorithm design, strong implementation skills for analyzing and visualizing big data, statistical knowledge, and specific domain knowledge for different application problems. In particular, it is of increasing importance to develop powerful and integrative visualization methods combined with computational analytical methods. Furthermore, because of the growing relevance of visualization for bioinformatics, teaching visualization should also become part of the bioinformatics curriculum.\n</p> \n <p>\nWith this Dagstuhl Seminar we wanted to continue the process of community building across the disciplines of biology, bioinformatics, and visualization. We aim to bring together researchers from the different domains to discuss how to continue the BioVis interdisciplinary dialogue, to foster the development of an international community, to discuss the state-of-the-art and identify areas of research that might benefit from joint efforts of all groups involved.\n</p> \n <p>\nBased on the topics identified in the seminar proposal, as well as the interest and expertise of the confirmed participants, the following four topics were chosen as focus areas for the seminar, in addition to the overarching topic of collaboration  between the data visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities: \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Visualization challenges related to high-dimensional medical data.</b> Patient data is increasingly available in many forms including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, histologic, radiologic, and clinical, resulting in large (100s of TBs, 1000s of patients), heterogeneous (dozens of data types per patient) data repositories. Repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) contain a multitude of patient records which can be used for patient stratification, for high-risk group and response to treatment discoveries, or for disease subtype/biomarker discoveries. Still, patient records from the clinic are used singularly to diagnose patients in the clinic without including likely insights from other sources. Similarly, molecular expression signatures from the omic sources barely impinge on the clinical observations. There is an urgent need to bridge the divide the precision medicine gap between the laboratory and the clinic, as well as a need to bridge the quantitative sciences with biology. Additionally, many precision medicine studies plan to include sensor data (e.g. physical activity, sleep, and other patient-worn sensors) that will add another dimension of complexity that analysis and visualization tools need to take into account. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis highly relevant topic focused on visual analytic tools and collaborations that will promote and leverage notions of patient similarity across the phenotypical scales. Scalable and robust machine learning methods will need to work synergistically to integrate evidence of similarity while meaningful visual encodings should simultaneously summarize and illuminate patient similitude at the individual and group level. This topic is closely related to some of the topics below.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Visualization of biological networks.</b> Modeling the stochasticity of genetic circuits is an important field of research in systems biology, and can help elucidate the mechanisms of cell behavior, which in turn can be the basis of diseases. These models can further enable predictions of important phenotypic cellular states. However, the analysis of stochastic probability distributions is difficult due to their spatiotemporal and multidimensional nature, and due to the typically large number of simulations run under varying settings. Moreover, stochastic network researchers often emphasize that what is of biological significance is often not of statistical significance -- numerical analyses often miss small or rare events of particular biological relevance. A visual approach can help, in contrast, in mining the network dynamics through the landscape defined by these probability distributions. \n</p> \n <p>\nAnother major challenge relates to finding \"stable behavior\" of networks, including those recruited in signal transduction. Multistability and bistability have been often studied in metabolic chemically reactive networks. Necessary conditions have been formulated to imply the emergence of stable phenotypes. However, these methods have been deployed on small networks. Recently many groups have recognized that scalable methods can be explored using steady state or quasi steady state models that are derived from stoichiometry and rate-action kinetics. These unfortunately suffer from the lack of methods that will examine the large parametric space. Consider this: N interacting molecules imply N2 interactions and in turn the same order of the governing \"parameters\" (activation rates and abundances). For even mid-size portions of salient pathways (EGFR, B-cell Receptor activation, etc.) finding stable states is challenging. It is certainly the case that a complete graph is never realized and sparsity and network mining can be used to glean the necessary structure. Design of experiments followed by visualization of parametric spaces will be required to search for these stable points. Furthermore, the huge size of this space needs possibly new scalable approaches for the visualization.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Visualization for pan-genomics.</b> With the advent of next-generation sequencing we can observe the increase of genome data both in the field of metagenomics (simultaneous assessment of many species) as well as within the field of pan-genomics. In metagenomics, the aim is to understand the composition and operation of complex microbial consortia in environmental samples. On the other hand in pangenomics genomes within a species are studied. While originally a pan-genome has been referred to as the full complement of genes in a clade (mainly a species in bacteria or archaea), this has recently been generalized to considering a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference rather than a single genome. \n</p> \n <p>    \nIn bioinformatics, both topics impose a number of computational challenges. For example, a recent review paper by Marschall et al. on \"Computational Pan-Genomics: Status, Promises and Challenges\"  (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbw089\">DOI: 10.1093/bib/bbw089</a>) addresses current efforts in this sub-area of bioinformatics. This area needs novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms. While the development of new promising computational methods and new data structures both in metagenomics and pangenomics can be observed, a number of open challenges exist. One of them in the area of pangenomics is for example the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. However, the important topic of pangenome visualization has not been addressed in the aforementioned review. Interestingly this has been taken up in a break-out session in a recent Dagstuhl seminar on \"Next Generation Sequencing - Algorithms, and Software For Biomedical Applications\", and identified as a topic of urgent interest and demand. One observation for example is that in pan-genomes there are segments of conserved regions interspersed by highly variable regions.  Open question here is how to visualize the highly variable regions, or how to interpret its content in the context of its neighborhood. Other open visualization topics involve the visual representation of the graph structure underlying pangenomes. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the field of metagenomics some common visualization approaches, such as heatmaps or scatter plots in combination with principal component analyses, are used, however, many open challenges exist. In particular those visualization tools that are developed for genomics studies fall short in representing large-scale, high dimensional metagenomics studies. Especially the magnitude of the data presents a challenge to meaningfully represent biologically valuable information from complex analysis results. Thus also in this topic the question of large-scale and heterogeneous data visualization is of central importance.\n </p> \n <p>\n<b>Curriculum development of biological data visualization.</b> Parallel to the recognized need to teach bioinformatics students about big data in biology, there is a growing need to familiarise students with modern visual analytics methodologies applied to biological data, and to provide hands-on training. While several community members are teaching summer camps, tutorials, and workshops on biological data visualization, many of these educational sessions take the form of an introduction to specific tools. We find ourselves handling similar questions: what is exploratory data visualization, what is visual analytics, which frameworks to think about visualization exist, how can we explore design space, and how can we visualise biological data to gain insight into them, so that hypotheses can be generated or explored and further targeted analyses can be defined? \n</p> \n <p>    \nDespite the increasing importance of visualization for bioinformatics, there is currently a general lack of integration into the bioinformatics education, and a useful and appropriate curriculum has not yet been developed. In this topic the following questions will be addressed: What should a modern and seminal curriculum for visualization in bioinformatics look like? How far along the introductory visualization courses should this curriculum go, while allowing biological data topics as well? What are the essential topics, and how can comprehensive training be achieved?\n</p> \n <p>\nThe schedule for the seminar was developed by the organizers based on previous successful Dagstuhl seminars. Emphasis was given to a balance between prepared talks and panels and break groups for less structured discussions focused on a selection of highly relevant topics. Three types of plenary presentations were available to participants who had indicated interest in presenting during the seminar: overview talks (20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions), regular talks (10 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions), and panel presentations (5 minutes per speaker followed by a 20 -- 25 minute discussion). The break out groups met multiple times for several hours during the week and reported back to the overall group on several occasions.  This format successfully brought bioinformatics and visualization researchers onto the same platform, and enabled researchers to reach a common, deep understanding through their questions and answers. It also stimulated very long,\nintense, and fruitful discussions that were deeeply appreciated by all participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis report describes in detail the outcomes of this meeting. Our outcomes include a set of white papers summarizing the breakout sessions, overviews of the talks, and a detailed curriculum for biological data visualization courses.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jan Aerts, Nils Gehlenborg, Georgeta Elisabeta Marai, and Kay Katja Nieselt\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe complexity class P (polynomial time) contains a vast variety of problems of practical interest and yet relatively little is known about the structure of P, or of the complexity of many individual problems in P. It is known that there exist contrived problems requiring Omega(n1.5) time or Omega(n2) time, and yet to date no unconditional nonlinear lower bounds have been proved for any problem of practical interest. However, the last few years have seen a new resurgence in conditional lower bounds, whose validity rests on the conjectured hardness of some archetypal computational problem. This work has imbued the class P with new structure and has valuable explanatory power.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo cite a small fraction of recent discoveries, it is now known that classic dynamic programming problems such as Edit Distance, LCS, and Fr\u00e9chet distance require quadratic time (based on the conjectured hardness of <em>k</em>-CNF-SAT), that the best known triangle enumeration algorithms are optimal (based on the hardness of 3-SUM), that Valiant's context-free grammar parser is optimal (based on the hardness of <em>k</em>-CLIQUE), and that the best known approximate Nash equilibrium algorithm is optimal (based on the hardness of 3-SAT).\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar will bring together top researchers in diverse areas of theoretical computer science and include a mixture of both experts and non-experts in conditional lower bounds. Some specific goals of this seminar are listed below.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>  Numerous important problems (such as Linear Programming) seem insoluble in linear time, and yet no conditional lower bounds are known to explain this fact. A goal is to discover conditional lower bounds for key problems for which little is currently known.\n</li><li> Recent work has been based on both traditional hardness assumptions (such as the ETH, SETH, 3SUM, and APSP conjectures) and a variety of newly considered hardness assumptions (such as the OMv conjecture, the k-CLIQUE conjecture, and the Hitting Set conjecture). Almost nothing is known about the relative plausibility of these conjectures, or if multiple conjectures are, in fact, equivalent. A goal is to discover formal relationships between the traditional and newer hardness assumptions.\n</li><li> A key goal of the seminar is to disseminate the techniques used to prove conditional lower bounds, particularly to researchers from areas of theoretical computer science that have yet to benefit from this theory. To this end the seminar will include a number of tutorials from top experts in the field.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Moshe Lewenstein, Seth Pettie, and Virginia Vassilevska Williams\n                </div> \n",

The seminar explored research challenges at the interface of computing and game theory. This area has seen fervent\nresearch activity in recent times. Specifically, game theoretic\nideas have found currency in three key areas of computer science: in\nthe <em>algorithms</em> community, algorithmic game theory is now a\nwell-established sub-field; in <em>formal methods</em>, model checking and\nsynthesis problems have been studied using game-theoretic concepts;\nand in <em>artificial intelligence</em>, game theory has come to provide the\nfundamental conceptual vocabulary for the field of multi-agent\nsystems. Despite this manifest common interest, there is surprisingly\nlittle trade between game-theoretic approaches in these different subfields of computer\nscience. Our aim in this seminar was to start to build some bridges\nbetween these three areas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Swarat Chaudhuri, Sampath Kannan, Rupak Majumdar, and Michael J.

A particular difficulty in planning the agenda (see Fig. 1) arose due to the different time zones of the individual participants. It was especially important to us to offer at least some of the program items together to all participants (Opening and Group Work on Day 1, Summit and Closing on the last day). On the other days, we planned different activities in smaller (2-3 people) and larger (up to half of the participants) groups to better accommodate the participants based on their time zones.\n\n<a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4738/schedule.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Compact overview of the agenda for the week including different geographical zones (for better planning with participants from all-over the world).\" src=\"/storage/media/0004/4739/schedule.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a>\n</p> <caption><b>Figure 1</b> Compact overview of the agenda for the week including different geographical zones (for better planning with participants from all-over the world)</caption> \n <ul>\n<li>Monday, June 6: The seminar was opened and its main goals introduced by the seminar co-organizers Stephen Brewster, Andrew Kun, Andreas Riener and Orit Shaer.

After a social \"warm-up\" activity, Pecha Kucha presentations of all participants followed. During the presentations, all participants were instructed to collect questions, ideas, thoughts, etc. on a Miro-board; The items were clustered by the organizers (in a short coffee break) and after that, a voting of topics to be picked-up/focusing on in the next days of the seminar (see Fig. 2) followed. This activity ended day 1.\n\n<a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4740/day1miroideas.png\"><img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4741/day1miroideas.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a>\n<a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4742/day1summaryvoting.png\">\n<img alt=\"Figure 2 Group activities on day 1: Collecting of ideas, thoughts, questions from the individual presentations; Majority voting after clustering of collected items.\" src=\"/storage/media/0004/4743/day1summaryvoting.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a>\n<caption><b>Figure 2 </b> Group activities on day 1: Collecting of ideas, thoughts, questions from the individual presentations; Majority voting after clustering of collected items.</caption>\n</li>\n<li>Tuesday, June 7: The second day of the seminar was dedicated to the \u201cWork(shop) for the Future of Work and Mobility in Automated Vehicles\u201d. In this workshop, participants (see Fig. 3) worked together on user needs and how to fulfill them during shared or private automated mobility. The workshop was conducted twice \u2013 each with half of the participants and lasted for about two hours including a short coffee break. In order to get all participants in the mood for the workshop and to allow them to reflect on the topic from their personal point of view, we invited everybody to complete a brief ( 10 min.)\n\u201cpre-questionnaire\u201d before the workshop (Link: <a href=\"https://thimib.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_03eUqLNatcDgzs2\">https://thimib.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_03eUqLNatcDgzs2</a>).

Furthermore, it seems\nnecessary to think about using the Internet itself more intensively to\ndevelop new educational materials. In order to start a discussion of\nsuch educational aspects, a Dagstuhl seminar titled \"Using Networks to Teach About Networks\" has been organized. Some questions discussed during the\nseminar were:\n</p> <ul>\n<li>Which topics should be taught in a typical undergraduate course?\n  What are the essential basic principles that need to be understood?\n  Which topics should be covered in a typical graduate course? How to\n  deal with the fact that architectural concepts are often violated in\n  real networks?\n</li><li>How should topics be taught? How to best use the Internet for\n  teaching how the Internet works? How can we more easily \u2019mesh\u2019\n  teaching materials? Can we better organize the sharing of video\n  content, assignments, or experimental setups? Do we need an open\n  source platform for teaching materials? What about open source books\n  on computer networks replacing traditional textbooks?\n</li><li>What is the experience with modern teaching styles, such as pure\n  online courses like MOOCs or flipped classrooms?

Much of econometrics is about handing data and deriving understanding from data.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the AGT context, this would seem to apply most readily to data emanating\nfrom \"economic\" sources, and of course there are plenty of examples.\nThe most notable of these is learning user preferences from examples.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere have been workshops at the AGT/Machine Learning interface in the ACM-EC conference (the 2017 EC held the 3rd workshop on Algorithmic Game Theory and Data Science) but there is clearly space for more meetings on this topic, and this is the first one to take place at Dagstuhl. \nAs such, it contributed to the development of the European community in this research area (noting that ACM-EC is usually held in the USA).\n</p> \n <p>\nIt was pleasing that the seminar attracted quite a high proportion of participants who were visiting Dagstuhl for this first time, alongside others who have made multiple visits. \nThere was a good balance amongst representatives of Algorithmic\nGame Theory, Machine Learning, and Economics.\n</p> \n <p>One can classify the AGT/Machine Learning topics as follows.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Usage of ML ideas (reinforcement learning, multi-arm bandits, etc.) into decision making under uncertainty (and the search for game-theoretic solution notions such as equilibria)\n</li><li>usage of game-theoretic tools into machine learning approaches (as in Generative Adversarial Nets). \n</li><li>A basic test case is learning user valuations from historical data. For example, given the outcome of previous auctions to learn the distribution of the users' valuations and the goal is to define near optimal mechanisms. (This is also an aspect in learning \"revealed preferences\".)\n</li><li>Query complexity of solution concepts of games, aspects of which are\napplicable to learning adversary preferences in the context of\nsecurity/patrolling games.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar was structured around longer invited/tutorial talks (typically lasting 1.5-2 hours), one or two such talks taking place each day. These were followed by shorter contributed talks.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe thank Argy Deligkas for serving as collector of the abstracts.\n</p> \n <h4>Keynote/tutorial talks</h4> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Monday</b> Sven Seuken, University of Zurich\nDesign of Machine Learning-Based Mechanisms;\nYaron Singer, Harvard University: Learning, Optimization, and Noise\n</li><li><b>Tuesday</b> Claudio Gentile, Universita dell\u2019Insubria:\nNo Regret and Sequential Prediction\n</li><li><b>Wednesday</b> Denis Nekipelov, University of Virginia:\nRobust Inference for Non-Robust Models\n</li><li><b>Thursday</b> Jamie Morgenstern, University of Pennsylvania:\nThe Sample Complexity of Single-Parameter Auction Design\n</li><li><b>Friday</b> Yakov Babichenko, Technion:\nInformational Bounds on Equilibria, and its Relation to Learning\n</li></ul> \n <h4>Related topics not covered</h4> \n <p>There is ongoing work at the intersection of macroeconomics and machine-learning\ntechniques, that was out of scope of this meeting but may be of interest\nlater. For example, ongoing work on Vector Autoregressive models in\nthe context of multivariate time series modelling, which may later lead to\ninteresting problem in computational learning theory. Another topic that\nwas only touched-on is agent-based models of macroeconomics.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Paul W.

            "title": "Computational Counting",
            "data": "\n <p>\nComputational counting problems arise in practical applications in many fields such as statistical physics, information theory and\nmachine learning. In such a problem, the goal is to compute or to estimate a weighted sum. Some typical computational counting problems include evaluating a probability, the expectation of a random variable, a partition function, or an integral.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe study of the computational complexity of counting problems requires a coherent set of techniques which are different in flavour from\nthose employed in other algorithmic branches of computer science. Relevant techniques include the analysis of Markov chains, the\nanalysis of correlation decay, parameterised algorithms and complexity, and dichotomy techniques for constructing detailed\nclassifications.\n</p> \n <p>\nMost computational problems are intractable when considered from the perspective of classical complexity, so it is important to find ways to cope with intractability. These include approximation, randomisation, as well as viewing computational counting through the lens of parameterised complexity, where the goal is to find algorithms that are efficient when some key parameter is \"small\".\nIntractability thresholds often relate to \"phase transitions\" as these key parameters vary.  Great progress has been made in recent years towards understanding the complexity of approximate counting, based largely on a connection with these phase transitions. \n</p> \n <p>\nSpecific themes identified for consideration at the meeting included:\n</p> <ul>\n<li><em>Exact counting</em>, including classifications, quasi-polynomial and/or  moderately exponential algorithms for intractable problems, and parameterised algorithms;  also complexity-theoretic limitations to obtaining exact solutions.\n</li><li><em>Approximate counting</em> including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (<em>MCMC</em>) algorithms, and algorithms based on decay of correlations; also complexity-theoretic limitations to obtaining approximate solutions.\n</li><li>The interplay between <em>phase transitions</em> and computational tractability.\n</li><li><em>Constraint satisfaction</em> problems and the more general <em>Holant</em> framework. The partition functions of many models in statistical physics are included within this setting.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn the event, the talks ranged more widely than this list suggests.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough the topic of Computational Counting has been explored at various meetings, including at Dagstuhl, for a number of years, it continues to retain its freshness.  New approaches are found, new insights are gained, and new connections drawn with other areas both inside and outside computer science.  Among the new directions that have emerged since the previous Dagstuhl Seminar in this series are the following.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Results from quantum information theory applied to the apparently unrelated task of classifying the complexity of Holant problems. (Refer to the talk by Miriam Backens.)\n</li><li> A new paradigm for designing polynomial-time algorithms for approximating partition functions with complex parameters. This is based on Taylor expansion in a zero-free region of the parameter space combined with an ingenious approach to enumerating small substructures. (Refer to talks by Alexander Barvinok, Jingcheng Liu, Viresh Patel and Guus Regts.)\n</li><li> Emerging connections between the Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma - specifically the Shearer condition and the Moser-Tardos algorithmic version - and sampling and approximate counting.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe rise of technology that supports a partnership between user and computer highlights an opportunity for a new era of \"human-computer integration\", contrasting the previously dominant paradigm of computers functioning as tools. However, most work around these technologies only focused on the instrumental perspective to achieve extrinsic performance objectives. However, phenomenology emphasizes that it is also important to support the experiential perspective, which indicates that technology should also help people pay attention to their lived experiences and personal growth in order to deepen their understanding of their own bodies. This seminar focuses on embodied integration, where a computer tightly integrates with the person's body. Although an increasing number of systems are emerging, a thorough understanding of how to design such systems is notably absent. The reason for this is the limited knowledge about how such embodied partnerships unfold, and what underlying theory could guide such developments. This seminar brought together leading experts from industry and academia, including those who are central to the development of products and ideas such as wearables, on-body robotics, and exertion systems. The goal was to address key questions around the design of embodied integration and to jump-start collaborations to pioneer new approaches for a human-computer integrated future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Florian Mueller, Jonathan Grudin, Pattie Maes, Zhuying Li\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Software Protection Decision Support and Evaluation Methodologies",
            "data": "\n <h3>Overview and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\n\nThe area of Man-At-The-End (MATE) software protection is an evolving battlefield on which attackers execute white-box attacks: They control the devices and environments and use a range of tools to inspect, analyze, and alter software and its assets. Their tools include disassemblers, code browsers, debuggers, emulators, instrumentation tools, fuzzers, symbolic execution engines, customized OS features, pattern matchers, etc.\n\nTo meet the security requirements of assets embedded in software, i.e., valuable data and code, many protections need to be composed. Those requirements include the confidentially of secret keys and software IP (novel algorithms, novel deep learning models, ...), and the integrity of license checking code and anti-copy protections. Attackers attack them through reverse engineering and tampering, for which they use the aforementioned tools and for which they often can afford spending time and effort on executing many, highly complex and time-consuming, manual and automated analyses. The need for composing many protections follows from the fact that advanced attackers can use all the mentioned tools and try many different approaches. In other words, to be effective, the deployed protections need to protect against all possible attack vectors. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs all protections come with overhead, and as many of them have downsides that complicate various aspects of the software development life cycle (SDLC), the users of a software protection tool cannot simply deploy all available protections. Instead, they have to select the protections and their parameters for every single asset in a program, taking into account non-functional requirements for the whole program and its SDLC. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers of this workshop, and many experts in their network, consider the lack of automated decision support for selecting the best protections, and the lack of a generally accepted, broadly applicable methodology to evaluate and quantify the strength of a selected combination, the biggest challenges in the domain of software protection. As a result, the deployment of software protection is most often not trustworthy, error-prone, not measurable, and extremely expensive because experts are needed and they need a lot of time, increasing the time to market.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis situation is becoming ever more problematic. For example, connected intelligent vehicles are quickly being deployed in the market now and autonomous vehicles are going to be deployed in 3-5 years. Software protection evaluation and measurement research and development must match up that pace to provide enough technology support for controllable and scientific methods to manage the quality of automotive security as key part of vehicle reliability and safety. There is hence a huge need to make progress w.r.t. software protection decision support and evaluation methodologies, the topic of the proposed seminar. \n</p> \n <h3>Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>Following a pre-seminar survey among the registered participants to focus the seminar and to select the highest priority objectives among the many possible ones, the primary goal of the seminar was determined to be the foundations of a white paper on software protection evaluation methodologies, to be used as a best practices guideline by researchers and practitioners when they evaluate (combinations of) defensive and/or offensive techniques in the domain of MATE software protection. This can also serve as a guideline to reviewers of submitted journal and conference papers in which novel techniques are proposed and evaluated. A secondary goal was the establishment of good benchmarking practices, including the choice of suitable benchmarks and the selection and generation thereof for use in future research in MATE software protection. A third goal was to collect feedback and ideas on how to push the state of the art in decision support systems. \n</p> \n <h3>Week Overview</h3> \n <h4>Preparation</h4> \n <p>Prior to the seminar, the organizers set up a survey to collect the necessary information for a seminar bundle that provided background information about and to all participants. Moreover, they collected information regarding the potential outcomes that participants were most interested in, to which ones they could likely contribute, and which potential outcomes they considered most likely to make progress on. Furthermore, a reading list was presented to the participants with the goal of getting everyone on the same page as much and as soon as possible [1--8].\n</p> \n <p>\nWhereas the schedule for the first two days was mostly fixed a priori, the schedule for later days was more dynamic, as it was adapted to the feedback obtained by the organizers during the early days, and to the outcomes of different sessions.\n</p> \n <h4>Monday</h4> \n <p>The first day was devoted to setting the scope of the seminar, and clarifying the seminar goals, strategy, and plan.\nIn the morning, three overviews were presented of man-at-the-end software protection techniques in the scope of the seminar, as well as some attacks on them. These presentations focused on obfuscation vs. static analysis, (anti-)tampering in online games, and additional protections beyond the ones discussed in the first two presentations.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the early afternoon, four deeper technical introductions were presented of four more concrete classes of defensive and corresponding offensive techniques that would serve as case studies throughout the seminar: 1) virtual machine obfuscation, 2) (anti-)disassembly, 3) trace semantics based attacks, and 4) data obfuscation. The strategy for the week was to brainstorm about these concrete techniques first, in particular on how the strength of these techniques are supposed to be evaluated, e.g., in papers that present novel (combinations of) techniques, or in penetration tests. Later, the concrete results for the individual case studies would then be generalized into best practices and guidelines for software protection evaluation methodologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhereas the morning presentations and most of the case studies focused mostly on defensive techniques, three presentations in the afternoon provided complementary insights about offensive techniques, ranging from more academic semantics-based attack techniques, over an industrial case study of deobfuscation of compile-time obfuscation, and offensive techniques in binary analysis.\n</p> \n <p>\nThus, the scene was set in terms of both defensive and offensive techniques, and all participants to a large degree spoke the same language before starting the brainstorm sessions in the rest of the week. \n</p> \n <h4>Tuesday</h4> \n <p>Tuesday focused mostly on the seminar track of software protection evaluation methodologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the early morning, additional input was provided on existing, already studied aspects relevant to such methodologies. This included software protection metrics, empirical experiments to assess protections, and security economics. These presentations provided useful hooks for the next session, which consisted of parallel, small break-out brainstorm sessions (three groups per case study) on the first two case studies. In these brainstorm sessions, the goal was to provide answers to questions such as the following:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>What would a document similar to the SIGPLAN empirical evaluation checklist look like for papers presenting new VM-based protections?\n</li><li> Which requirements or recommendations can we put forward with respect to the protected objects (i.e., benchmarks) and their treatment (i.e., how they are created, compiled, ...) for the evaluation?\n</li><li> What aspects of the attack models and which assumptions should be made explicit, which ones should be justified, e.g., regarding attacker goals and attacker activities.\n</li><li> How should sensitivity to different inputs (e.g., random generator seeds, configuration options, features of code samples, ...) be evaluated and discussed?\n</li><li> What threats to validity should be discussed?\nitem What aspects of the protection should be evaluated (potency, resilience, learnability, usability, stealth, renewability, different forms of costs, ...)?\n</li><li> Under what conditions would you consider the protection to be ``real world'' applicable?\nitem What flaws (e.g., unrealistic assumptions) have you seen in existing papers that should be avoided?\n</li><li> What are (minimal) requirements / recommendations regarding reproducibility?\n</li><li> What pitfalls can you list that we should share with people?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAfter the independent brainstorms in small groups and following lunch, the three groups per case study came together to merge the results of their brainstorms, after which the merged results were shared in a plenary session. \n</p> \n <p>\nLater in the afternoon, additional ideas were presented on topics relevant for software protection evaluation methodologies. The covered topics were benchmark generation, security activities in protected software product life cycles, the resilience of software integrity protection (work in progress), and a (unified) measure theory for potency. These topics were presented after the initial brainstorms not to bias those brainstorms. Their nature was more forward looking, covering a number of open challenges as well as potential directions for future research. They offered the speakers a sound board to get feedback and could serve as the starting point of informal discussions later in the seminar. \n</p> \n <p>\nWhile the practice is discouraged by the Dagstuhl administration, we still decided to organize an evening session on Tuesday. Afterwards, we realized that this made the seminar a bit too dense, but it did serve the useful purpose of introducing the participants to the seminar track on decision support tools for software protection early enough in the seminar to allow enough time for informal discussions with and between researchers active on this topic during the remainder of the week. This was especially useful to allow those academic researchers to check the validity of some of their assumptions about real-world aspects with the present practitioners from industry and with researchers from other domains.\n</p> \n <p>\nBesides an overview of an existing design and implementation of a software\nprotection decision support system, a hands-on walk through of a practical\nattack on a virtual machine protection (as in one of the case studies) was\npresented, as well as some ideas to make such protection stronger.\n</p> \n <h4>Wednesday</h4> \n <p>Early on Wednesday morning, the focus shifted towards decision support tools, with three presentations by practitioners in companies that provide software protection solutions. These presentations focused on the support they provide to help their customers use their tools.\n</p> \n <p>\nLater in the morning, case studies 3 and 4 were discussed in another round of parallel, small group break-out brainstorm sessions.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the afternoon, the social outing took place, which consisted of a visit to Trier and a wine tasting at a winery where we also had dinner.\n</p> \n <h4>Thursday</h4> \n <p>On Thursday morning, another round of break-out sessions was organized to structure the outcomes of the first round. Based on inputs collected during the first three days, the organizers drafted a structure for a white paper on software protection methodologies. In 4 parallel sessions, the participants brainstormed on how to fit the results of the first round (i.e., bullet points with concrete guidelines and considerations for each case study) into that structure, and which parts of those results could be generalized beyond the individual case studies. In a plenary session, the results of these break-outs were then presented.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition, the specific topic of benchmarking was discussed, focusing on questions regarding the required features of benchmarks (e.g., should or should they not contain actual security-sensitive assets) as well as potential strategies to get from the situation today, in which very few benchmarks used in papers are available for reproducing the results, to a situation in which a standard set of benchmarks is available and effectively used in studies. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the afternoon, several demonstrations of practical tools were given, including the already mentioned decision support system of which the concepts had been presented on Tuesday evening and the Binary Ninja disassembler that is rapidly gaining popularity. Two presentations were also given on usable security and challenges and capabilities of modern static analysis of obfuscated code. There provided additional insights useful for both designers of decision support tools and evaluation methodologies. \n</p> \n <h4>Friday</h4> \n <p>The last morning started off with a potpourri of interesting topics that did not fit well in the main tracks of general evaluation methodologies and decision support on the one hand, and benchmarking on the other. Given the availability of many experts in the domain of software protection, we decided that everyone that wanted to launch new ideas or collect feedback on them in the broad domain of the seminar should have that chance. So the day started with short presentations on the protection of machine learning as a specific new type of application, on security levels for white-box cryptography, and on hardware/software binding using DRAM.\n</p> \n <p>\nLater in the morning, the seminar was wrapped up with a discussion of the outcomes so far, and an agreement on plans to continue the work on the software protection evaluation methodology white paper and the assembly of a benchmark collection. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>S.

            "data": "\n <p>The Dagstuhl Seminar 21452 \u201cUnambiguity in Automata Theory\u201d was a seminar of five days that took place from November 7th to 12th, 2021, organized by Thomas Colcombet, Karin Quaas, and Micha\u0142 Skrzypczak. A general goal of the seminar was to bring together experts from different fields of automata theory, to stimulate an exchange of recent results and new proof techniques concerning unambiguity and related topics from automata theory. There were 26 on-site participants from nine different countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, UK), and further 10 remote participants from seven countries (France, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA). The central topic of the seminar was unambiguous automata. An automaton is unambiguous if it can make nondeterministic choices, but it is guaranteed that for every input there\nis at most one accepting run. There have recently been numerous new results concerning unambiguous automata; at the same time, a lot of natural and interesting problems have been\nopen for decades. Before the seminar, we identified the following key topics/open problems:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Unambiguous Finite Automata</b> What is the state complexity of the complementation of unambiguous automata? Here, the state complexity refers to how the number of states of the resulting automaton depends on the number of states of the original automaton.\n</li><li><b>Unambiguous versions of infinite state systems, such as vector addition systems with states (VASS) or register automata</b> Open problems concerning such systems are, for instance: What can be new techniques for proving lower bounds for the containment problem? Are languages accepted by unambiguous register automata with guessing closed under complement?\n</li><li><b>Unambiguous tree automata</b> One of the most important open questions is how to decide whether a given tree-regular language is recognizable by an unambiguous automaton.\n</li><li><b>B\u00fcchi automata and probabilistic automata</b> What is the computational complexity of the containment of unambiguous B\u00fcchi automata? Tropical automata For this class of weighted automata one of the most important and long standing open questions is whether a given series is polynomially ambiguous.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar was planned to consist of talks and working group sessions, where participants could work on-site on open problems. \nIn order to integrate all participants and to initiate new collaborations, we started the seminar on Monday with introductory talks, where every participant shortly introduced herself to the group. In these introductory sessions, it was also possible to announce open problems the participants were interested to work on during the seminar. We had additionally collected such open problems before the seminar to make them available to the participants in advance. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe second day of the seminar (Tuesday) was dedicated to presentations given by the participants. This day started with an invited talk by Denis Kuperberg on  good-for-games automata. Later the day, eight participants of the seminar presented short contributed talks on topics related to unambiguity.\n</p> \n <p>\nWednesday began with the invited talk by Gabriele Puppis on register automata. Later, a single contributed talk was given and the whole afternoon was devoted to an excursion and group work. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn Thursday morning, Wojtek Czerwi\u0144ski gave an invited talk on future-determinisation. After that, four contributed talks were given, and the late afternoon was devoted to work in subgroups.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, on Friday morning we held a closing ceremony. The rest of the day was left to participants to summarise their discussions in subgroups and prepare for departure.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring all days, we have used Schloss Dagstuhl's excellent technical facilities to connect and communicate to remote participants of the seminar. Our experiences regarding such a hybrid Dagstuhl seminar are twofold. On the one hand, it is practical to give remote participants the opportunity to follow the on-site presentations (and Sylvain Lombardi also gave a remote talk). On the other hand, our main aim was to bring together researchers to actually work on concrete problems. It was difficult to integrate participants in group work, when groups gather at different places in the facilities, or when important discussions are led during the excursion or the dinner. We appreciated very much the opportunity to gather on-site at Schloss Dagstuhl after a long time of only non-physical meetings due to the Covid pandemics. As summarized in Session 4, several new collaborations between participants of the seminar have been initiated. We hope that the seminar has inspired new ideas, and interesting new results will be published by the participants. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe would like to warmly thank Schloss Dagstuhl for making this seminar possible. We especially would like to thank for the great help and support in the organization before and during the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Thomas Colcombet, Karin Quaas, and Michal Skrzypczak\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Inter-Vehicular Communication Towards Cooperative Driving",
            "data": "\n <p>\nLooking back at the last decade, one can observe enormous progress in the domain of vehicular networking. In this growing community, many ongoing activities focus on the design of communication protocols to support safety applications, intelligent navigation, multi-player gaming and others. Very large projects have been initiated to validate the theoretic work in field tests and protocols are being standardized. With the increasing interest from industry, security and privacy have also become crucial aspects in the stage of protocol design in order to support a smooth and carefully planned roll-out. We are now entering an era that might change the game in road traffic management. This is supported by the U.S. federal government announcement in December 2016 that National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) plans to make V2V devices in new vehicles mandatory. This coincides with the final standardization of higher layer networking protocols in Europe by the ETSI.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe vehicular networking research also complements the ongoing activities towards automated driving. Very successful activities started with the Google and lead to first projects on the road such as the Singapore driverless taxi service or the platooning experiments in Scandinavia and now Germany.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe management and control of network connections among vehicles and between vehicles and an existing network infrastructure is currently one of the most challenging research fields in the networking domain. Using the terms Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC), Car-2-X (C2X), or Vehicle-2-X (V2X), many applications \u2013 as interesting as challenging \u2013 have been envisioned and (at least) partially realized.  In this context, a very active research field has developed. There is a long list of desirable applications that can be grouped into four IVC categories:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> eSafety applications that try to make driving safer, e.g. road hazard warning;\n</li><li> traffic efficiency applications aiming at more efficient and thus greener traffic, e.g., detection of traffic jams;\n</li><li> manufacturer oriented applications, e.g., automatic software updates; and\n</li><li> comfort applications, e.g. automatic map updates.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nIn 2010, a first Dagstuhl Seminar (10402) was organized on the topic of inter-vehicular communication. The motivation was to bring together experts in this field to investigate the state of the art and to highlight where sufficient solutions already existed. The main outcome of this very inspiring seminar was that there are indeed areas within this research where scientific findings are being consolidated and adopted by industry. This was the consensus of quite intriguing discussions among participants from both industry and academia. Yet, even more aspects have been identified where substantial research is still needed. These challenges have been summarized in the following IEEE Communications Magazine article [1].\n</p> \n <p>\nA follow-up seminar (13392) was organized in 2013. The goal was to again bring together leading researchers both from academia and industry to discuss if and where the previously identified challenges have been adequately addressed, and to highlight where sufficient solutions exist today, where better alternatives need to be found, and also to give directions where to look for such alternatives. Furthermore, it was the goal of this workshop to go one step beyond and identify where IVC can contribute to the basic foundations of computer science or where previously unconsidered foundations can contribute to IVC. It turned out that quite a number of research questions were still open or insufficiently addressed. This particularly included scalability and real-time capabilities. These challenges have been summarized in the following IEEE Communications Magazine article [2].\n</p> \n <p>\nWe now shifted the focus of this seminar from basic networking principles to networked control applications. We were particularly interested in the first two IVC categories that are thought to yield substantial benefits for the emerging \"cooperative automated driving\" domain. It is of utmost importance to bring together expertise from classical computer science (computer networking, simulation and modeling, operating system design), from electrical engineering (digital signal processing, communication networks), as well as from automated driving (mechanical engineering, image processing, control theory). Building upon the great success of the first two seminars, with this follow-up seminar, we aimed to again bring together experts from all these fields from both academia and industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar focused intensively on discussions in several working groups. To kick-off these discussions, we invited two keynote talks \"Cooperative Driving A Control of a Networking Problem?\" by Renato Lo Cigno and \"Cooperative driving \u2013 maneuvers, perception, and IVC\" by Lars Wolf. These keynotes were complemented by four additional talks: Human-in-the-Loop: Towards Deeply Integrated Hybridized Systems (Falko Dressler), Machine Learning for Cooperative Driving (Geert Heijenk), Measuring Privacy in Vehicular Networks (Isabel Wagner), and Predictable V2X Networking for Application-Networking Co-Design (Hongwei Zhang). We finally organized the following working groups on some of the most challenging issues related to inter-vehicular communication and cooperative driving:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency and Heterogeneous V2X Networking,\n</li><li> Human-in-the-Loop,\n</li><li> Safety-critical Vehicular Network Applications,\n</li><li> Security and Privacy,\n</li><li> Network and Cloud based Control, and\n</li><li> Sensing and Data Management.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nFor most of these working groups, we provide in-depth feedback from the experts in this report.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Falko Dressler, Hannes Hartenstein, Onur Altintas, and Ozan K.

            "title": "SAT and Interactions",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe problem of deciding whether a propositional formula is satisfiable (SAT) is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science, both theoretically and practically. Its theoretical significance derives from the Cook-Levin Theorem, identifying SAT as the first NP-complete problem. Since then SAT has become a reference for an enormous variety of complexity statements, among them the celebrated Pe vs NP problem: one of seven million-dollar Clay Millennium Problems. Due to its NP hardness, SAT has been classically perceived as an intractable problem, and indeed, unless Pe=NP, no polynomial-time algorithm for SAT exists. \n</p> \n <p>\nThere are many generalisations of the SAT problem to further logics, including quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) and modal and temporal logics. These logics present even harder satisfiability problems as they are associated with complexity classes such as PSPACE, which  encompasses NP. However, QBFs, modal and temporal logics can express many practically relevant problems far more succinctly, thus applying to more real-world problems from artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, verification, and planning.\n</p> \n <p>\nDue to its practical implications, intensive research has been\nperformed on how to solve SAT problems in an automated\nfashion. The last decade has seen the development of practically\nefficient algorithms for SAT, QBFs and further logics and their implementation as solvers, which successfully solve huge industrial instances.\n</p> \n <p>\nVery often, these developments take place within different communities, e.g., there has been almost no interaction between the areas of SAT/QBF solving and solving for modal logics.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThe main aim of the proposed Dagstuhl Seminar therefore was to bring\ntogether researchers from proof complexity and proof theory, SAT, MaxSAT and QBF solving, and modal logics so that they can communicate state-of-the-art advances and embark on a systematic interaction that will enhance the synergy between the different areas. As such the seminar was the first workshop (in Dagstuhl and elsewhere) to unite researchers working on both theory and practice of propositional SAT, QBF, and modal logics. One of the specific aims was to foster more interaction between these different communities with the goal to transfer the success of theoretical research on SAT to further logics\nand SAT problems. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo facilitate such interactions, the seminar included a number of survey talks to introduce neighbouring communities to the main notions, results, and challenges of the represented areas.  The following survey talks were given during the seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Massimo Lauria: Proof Complexity: A Survey,\n</li><li>Lutz Stra\u00dfburger: Introduction to Deep Inference,\n</li><li>Vijay Ganesh: Machine Learning and Logic Solvers: The Next Frontier,\n</li><li>Mikol\u00e1\u0161 Janota: QBF Solving and Calculi: An Overview,\n</li><li>Jo\u00e3o Marques-Silva: Practical MaxSAT Solving: A Survey,\n</li><li>Cl\u00e1udia Nalon: Modal Logics: An Overview.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Each of these surveys was accompanied by one or more sessions with contributed talks dedicated to recent specific results of the field. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar also included an open discussion session on `Future Directions of Research', where ideas for a closer interaction between theoretical fields such as proof theory and proof complexity and practical fields such as SAT/QBF and modal solving were discussed.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organisers believe that the seminar fulfilled their original high goals: most talks were a great success and many participants reported about the inspiring seminar atmosphere, fruitful interactions, and a generally positive experience. The organisers and participants wish to thank the staff and the management of Schloss Dagstuhl for their assistance and excellent support in the arrangement of a very successful and productive event.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Olaf Beyersdorff, Uwe Egly, Meena Mahajan, and Claudia Nalon\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar, initially planned in May 2020, took place as a hybrid conference in November 2021. Eighteen participants were on site, and thirty three participated remotely out of which five from East Asia and twelve from America. \n</p> \n <p>\nDue to the pandemic, getting together for a conference has been an important event, and an outstanding exchange time between researchers (compared to a two years pandemic context where interaction has greatly been reduced). In particular, having a significant part of the participants on site has been a real asset compared to the full online conferences. Note also that this has been particularly true for young researchers that are in the process of developing networks and developing collaborations. \n</p> \n <p>\n48 talks were given including 18 on site and 30 remotely. The program was organized into topics and structured to the extent possible to minimize the challenges posed by the time difference between on-site and remote participants. Speakers from East-Asia were assigned time slots in the morning and speakers from America in the afternoon. The beginning of the afternoon was a privileged time for all participants to meet. The social afternoon was canceled, as it would not have been inclusive for remote participants. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe time freed allowed us to extend the time assigned to topic focused groups sessions. This triggered, under the supervision of five on-site participants, development of topic focused reports. Two of these reports, <em>The Future of CAD</em> (group led by Tom Grandine) and <em>Design Optimization</em> (group led by Konstantinos Gavriil) address the evolution of the application fields in Geometric Modeling, closely linked to its use in Industry. Three other reports on emerging topics have also been based on the group working sessions. <em>Additive Manufacturing</em> (a group led by Sylvain Lefebvre) has been identified as a disruptive technology and has triggered the emergence of new geometric models and materials. <em>Isogeometric Analysis</em> (group led by Carla Manni) addresses how the gap between geometric modeling and simulation can be bridged by replacing the traditional shape functions of Finite Element Analysis by B-splines that cross element boundaries. It thus supplies continuous models connecting the representations of Computer Aided Design and Finite Element Analysis. <em>Geometric Machine Learning</em> (group led by Rene Hiemstra) is a fast evolving domain. Deep learning approaches have already changed the field of Computer Vision, and the contribution into Geometric Modeling is becoming more pregnant. These reports offer to the participants, and beyond, a perspective of the coming challenges in the field of Geometric Modeling.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn top of the communications done in Dagstuhl, a special issue of the journal Graphical Models, has been planned.

            "title": "Computational Challenges in Cooperative Intelligent Urban Transport",
            "data": "\n <p>\nFollowing the history of two Dagstuhl seminars on Computational Issues in Transportation in 2010 and 2013, the organizers of this follow-up seminar concentrated on upcoming, data-driven challenges in the area of urban transport. In recent years, urban transportation networks have become more diverse, with a growing mix of public and private operators providing disaggregated services and information. The resulting multitude of transportation options includes non-traditional modes and services such as car and bike sharing in addition to established public transport and individual car options. So far, it is challenging to combine detailed operational data automatically arising from these services, since these data are generated both from service operation and from the users of services via crowdsourcing. The seminar aimed to discuss how data sources can be made available for individual planning and system-wide coordination of urban transportation using an approach from distributed computing, i.e., getting all involved parties to cooperate in providing relevant spatial and temporal information in a timely fashion. It was not clear how to derive reliable information for planning and control approaches, or how to adapt optimization methodologies to make urban transportation more cooperative and intelligent. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe aims of the seminar were to extend the existing network in disciplines such as Computational Traffic Science, Optimization, Autonomic Computing and Artificial Intelligence for discussing computational challenges in cooperative intelligent urban transportation, mesh communities by collecting suggestions for (partial) solutions for burning issues in urban transportation and discussing the prerequisites for merging into interdisciplinary approaches,\ndocument the state of the art and current computational challenges in cooperative intelligent transportation. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo this end, an interdisciplinary group from areas such as computer science, geography, applied optimization and traffic engineering met at Dagstuhl. The number of attendees was advantageous for group discussions, not too small for breakout groups but also not too large for meaningful discussions in the plenum. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe started on Sunday evening with a game (\"Cards Against Urbanity -- special issue for this seminar\") specifically designed for this event by Ms. Cottrill. The game was a great success as icebreaker and helped bringing together the participants with their various backgrounds. Monday was opened with a keynote by Vonu Thakuriah, who discussed examples, prospects and challenges of emerging forms of data in transportation research and applications. The participants introduced themselves, bringing a significant object describing their relationship with the seminar\u2019s topic.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor the remaining seminar time, the participants were asked to contribute to the seminar\u2019s content by one of the following options: they could give an overview talk of an emerging area (20 minutes), a research statement on what they have been working on in their particular area (5 minutes), and they were asked to come together in groups that were defined dynamically on Monday afternoon. The resulting abstracts can be found in this report. Based on the participants\u2019 interests, groups discussing the topics of online simulation, pedestrian behavior, autonomous transportation, smart cities, and benchmark data emerged. On Wednesday afternoon, the participants went on a \u2018field trip\u2019 to the retail lab by DFKI in St. Wendel, where the future of retail can be explored hands-on. Since there was a significant interest in the provision of benchmark data for urban transport, there was a special session and group work devoted to this topic on Thursday afternoon. Friday morning was meant for collecting the results of the group work and collecting open challenges for future seminars.            \n</p> \n <p>\nSummarizing, the seminar identified computational challenges to cooperative intelligent urban transport, among others notably research on opportunistic groups in public transport (i.e., people sharing tickets and or trajectories in an ad-hoc fashion), freight pods attached to light rail (i.e., mixing of freight and passenger transportation), define a common language for sharing complex knowledge and real-time data in smart cities and creating benchmark datasets for different modelling purposes and at different scales. We think that the seminar was quite successful in extending the existing networks by bringing together researchers from many different disciplines relevant for the future of urban transport. Some of the groups are planning to write proposals for the appropriate EU calls coming out in October, while others have started to work on position papers describing the state of the art as well as resulting future challenges of the field.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Caitlin Doyle Cottrill, Jan Fabian Ehmke, Franziska Kl\u00fcgl, and Sabine Timpf\n                </div> \n",

It had 36 participants, who were researchers\nin theoretical computer science, combinatorics, and molecular biology. It was a geographically diverse group, with \nparticipants coming from the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Slovakia, \nHungary and New Zealand. The seminar featured 18 talks, three of which were hourlong talks, and an open problem session. \n</p> \n <p>\nNumerous collaborative research efforts have been started. Here is a sampling. \n</p> \n <p>\nMegan Martinez and Manda Riehl worked on a bijection between LP matchings (one of the RNA matchings described in Vincent Vatter's talk) and Klazar's nesting equivalent matchings. They studied a paper by Klazar and Aziza Jefferson's dissertation and made progress on the bijection.\n</p> \n <p>\nIstv\u00e1n Mikl\u00f3s, P\u00e9ter Erd\u00f6s and Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na worked on proving a log-convexity conjecture related to ordered degree sequences of bipartite graphs. \n</p> \n <p>\n Brona Brejova and Manda Riehl discussed two potential future projects related to gene and species tree reconciliation. The most probable starting point is a project involving gene and species trees where a gene is allowed to duplicate a string inside itself. This situation was not allowed in previous models, however it seems that as long as the specific breakpoints are not reused from this insertion, a modification of the previous algorithms could still be effective. \n</p> \n <p>\nJay Pantone, David Bevan and Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na collaborated on asymptotic enumeration of a balanced urns and balls model\nthat was seen to be a step towards finding a better upper bound for a pattern avoidance enumeration problem.  \n</p> \n <p>\nWe have all the reasons to believe that this, and many other joint research efforts that started during this seminar will\nlead to new results that would not have been possible without the seminar. Therefore, we strongly believe that the\nseminar was a success that we would like to repeat at some point in the future. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nDeep Learning systems are the hope of the fifth industrial revolution. However, recent studies have found that Deep Learning systems can be easily manipulated, i.e. in Natural Language Understanding, Object Recognition. How to introduce structures into Deep Learning systems to improve reliability and performance has become a hot topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Semantic Web (SW) communities around the world. The aim of the seminar is to bring together interdisciplinary researchers around the world for constructive discussions on this theme, in particular, it intends to establish international collaborations to promote computational Humor, with the hope to let AI bring more joy, more laugh into the world, and do more good for the society.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe hybrid seminar is structured in the form of Talks, Working Groups, and Open questions. The seminar started with the talk \"Hybrid AI for Humor\". The dynamic semantics of humor is beyond the reach of the classic symbolic AI, the deep learning paradigm, and current neural-symbolic integration methods, but can be captured by the neural geometric embedding, in terms of rotating sphere embedding. This novel embedding is rooted in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) in symbolic AI and Learning Representation (LR) in neural ML. The former tries to symbolically delineate the basic spatial knowledge that humans have and possible ways that this knowledge can be used as a reference for abstract knowledge in other domains. LR aims at learning latent feature knowledge from data. The motivation and a geometric approach to realizing the unification were introduced in the talk \"Rotating Spheres - A New Wheel for Neuro-Symbolic Unification\". The motion of rotating spheres in high-dimensional space is served as a computational model to simulate (1) the motion of the physical world, (2)  the circular interaction among the mind, the body, and the world (called <em>spraction</em> - a contraction of space, action, and abstraction, in which actions in space create abstractions). \n</p> \n <p>\nThe motion of the physical world is vividly explained in the talk \"Rotating Spheres in the Milky Way\". This <em>spraction</em> process is explained in the talk ``Thinking with the Body and the World'', which can guide the design of novel cognitive robots, and promote novel cognitive architectures. Two topics were covered by the talk \"Learning about Language and Action for Robots\", and the talk  \"Neural-Symbolic Models, Dual-Process Theories, and Cognitive Architectures\". \n</p> \n <p>\nIn primates, the same brain structures that support spatial thinking also support conceptual thinking, Single cells in hippocampus gather multi-media information from different memories in the brain to represent places in space, events in time, ideas in conceptual spaces.  \nUpdate-to-date research of neural simulation is introduced by Volker Tresp with the talk \"Knowledge Graph and Cognitive Learning: from Perception to Memory Embedding\", which maps embedding models to various cognitive memory functions, in particular to semantic and concept memory, episodic memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory. \n</p> \n <p>\nSpatial thinking is multi-modal and established and distorted by our actions and perceptions of the spaces we interact in. This raises two questions: What are good representations for video understanding? and  how to compute symbolic rules that the models have learned from the training data? Juergen Gall introduced holistic video understanding and argued the potential of hybrid approaches that combine neural networks with symbolic AI for video understanding and reasoning. Cuenca Grau, Bernado gave the talk \"Characterizing Graph Neural Networks Using Logical Rules\". He formally defines what it means for a set of logical rules to characterize the behavior of a model and proposes a GNN-based architecture that admits a characterization in terms of Datalog rules. \n</p> \n <p>\nSpatial thinking is evident in the ways we think and the ways we externalize thought, for example, through words. Our words act on thought the way we act on objects. The philosophy of spatial thinking challenges the computational approach to natural language processing and understanding. Roberto Navigli argued that Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is particularly challenging, as this requires the machine to go beyond processing strings to reach a semantic level. Recent developments and challenges were discussed through three key tasks in NLU, namely Word Sense Disambiguation, Semantic Role Labeling, and Semantic Parsing. Zhiyuan Liu argued that knowledge (including symbols, embeddings, or models) is the key to a deeper understanding of human languages and that big pretrained language models can be regarded as the most advanced approach to model knowledge and to capture knowledge (including commonsense) from plain text and that the key challenge is how to incorporate both open data and structural knowledge. Alexander Mehler reviewed problems of neural network-based language learning, suggested to introduce the concept of cognitive maps and spatial information processing, and sketched a synergistic model that relates the dynamics of distributed information processing to bias interaction. Jie Tang introduced Wu-Dao, China's first homegrown super-scale intelligent model system, with the goal of building an ultra-large-scale cognitive-oriented pretraining model to focus on essential problems in general artificial intelligence from a cognitive perspective. Wu-Dao substantially outperforms BERT on the SuperGLUE natural language understanding benchmark with the same amount of pre-training data. Alam Mehwish discusses the characteristics of the existing benchmark datasets for the task of KG Completion, and limitations of the existing benchmark datasets and targets those issues in the generation of LiterallyWikidata.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother externalization of spatial thinking is through graphics. In the talk \"Semi-Riemannian Graph Convolutional Networks\", Steffen Staab introduced their new geodesic tools that allow for extending neural network operations into geodesically disconnected semi-Riemannian manifolds.  Thomas Liebig introduced using p-adic coding and computation for structured domains or domains with inherent granularity.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe ultimate form of spatial thinking is comics (a form of humor, the most creative form of storytelling), which typically show bodies acting in space. Humor is used as a testbed and lighthouse for the development of AI and machine learning. In the talk \"Ethics of AI Humor\" Kiki explained how humor has frustrated symbolic and statistic AI approaches; in the talk \"Knowledge and Inferences Needed for Humor\" Julia Rayz introduced recent advances in transformer-based approaches, and raised open questions. \n</p> \n <p>\nWorking groups are the main components of the seminar. The hybrid seminar provides an excellent chance to practice the situation that participants can continue to work together after this seminar, which is the main outcome of this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar ended with the discussion \"Boxology for Hybrid Learning and Reasoning Systems\" chaired by Frank van Harmelen.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Tiansi Dong, Achim Rettinger, Jie Tang, Barbara Tversky, and Frank van Harmelen\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Theory of Randomized Optimization Heuristics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar is part of a biennial seminar series. This year, we focused on connections between classical topics of the community, such as Evolutionary Algorithms and Evolutionary Strategies (EA, ES), Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDA) and Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMO), and related fields like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). The mixture proved to be extremely successful. Already the first talk turned into a two hours long, vivid and productive plenary discussion. Participants like Peter Richtarik and Sebastian Stich brought valuable new perspectives from the SGD\ncommunity, and Micka\u00ebl Binois contributed the BO perspective. This yielded some new approaches to long-standing open problems, specifically for a convergence proof of the CMA-ES algorithm on quadratic functions.\n</p> \n <p>Another interesting and fruitful aspect of the seminar was a shift of perspective to search spaces that are under-represented in the community. Traditionally, the search spaces are product spaces, either discrete (especially the n-dimensional hypercube), or continuous (d-dimensional Euclidean space). This year we had some intense discussions in plenum and in working groups on other search spaces, triggered especially by Ekhine Irurozki's presentation on permutation spaces.\n</p> \n <p>\nNaturally, a big part of the seminar was also devoted to classical topics of the community. Highlights included talks by Benjamin Doerr on the first runtime result for the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and by Tobias Glasmachers on Convergence Analysis of the Hessian Estimation Evolution Strategy (HE-ES). The latter is the first convergence proof for a covariance matrix algorithm that does not truncate the condition number of the estimated covariance matrix. Some interesting new topics were also identified in traditional fields, such as whether we can understand better in which situations adapativity is necessary for efficient optimization by considering k-adaptive query complexity of optimization benchmarks.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, as organizers we were extremely happy with the mix of core community members and researchers from related fields. The connections with the latter were close enough that scientific discussions could (also) happen on technical levels, which is particularly useful since some low-hanging fruits are available from such interchanges. Importantly, the exchange happened between people who would probably not have met each other outside of the Dagstuhl Seminar. \n</p> \n <p>The seminar took place during the peak of the Omicron wave of Covid19, which made planning very difficult. The key step during preparation phase was a survey among the participants a few weeks before the seminar. We asked how likely it was that they could participate in person, and under which circumstances they would prefer which format (in-person or hybrid). The participants signalled us very clearly that they wanted this event to happen, and that they wanted it to happen in person. We want to thank all participants for their support! Other seminars in the week before and after ours had to be cancelled altogether, and this might also have happened to our seminar if not for the determination of our participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was smaller than previous versions, due to corona regulations. Moreover, some participants had to cancel at the last moment because they were corona-positive, or because they had no reliable child care. Especially the latter point can be frustrating, and we hope that Dagstuhl will be able to resume their support for on-site child care in the future. On the positive side, the intensity of the seminar more than made up for the smaller size, and might even have been due to the smaller number of participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, we want to thank Dagstuhl for their great support, both financially and to their great staff. We could always feel that it was their top priority to help us, and we are greatly indebted for the support!\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers,<br/>\n\nAnne Auger, Carlos M Fonseca, Tobias Friedrich, Johannes Lengler\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anne Auger, Carlos M.

            "title": "AI for the Social Good",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe purpose of Dagstuhl Seminar 19082: AI for the Social Good was to bring together researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to explore if and how AI and ML could benefit the social good. Indeed, AI and ML have made impressive progress in the last few years. Long-standing challenges like Go have fallen and the technology has entered daily use via the vision, speech or translation capabilities in billions of smartphones. The pace of research progress shows no signs of slowing down, and demand for talent is unprecedented. But as part of a wider AI for Social Good trend, this seminar wanted to contribute to ensuring that the social good does not become an afterthought in the rapid AI and ML evolution, but that society benefits as a whole.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe five-day seminar brought together AI and ML researchers from various universities and industry research labs with representatives from NGOs based in Somalia, Rwanda, Uganda, Belgium, United Kingdom and The Netherlands. These NGOs all pursue various social good goals, such as increasing access to justice for vulnerable people, promoting human rights &amp; protecting human rights defenders, and defeating poverty. On these topics, NGOs have rich domain knowledge, just like they have vast networks with (non-)governmental actors in developing countries. Mostly, NGOs have their finger on the pulse of the challenges that the world &amp; especially its most vulnerable inhabitants are facing today, and will be facing tomorrow. The objective of the seminar was to look at these challenges through an AI and ML lens, to explore if and how these technologies could help NGOs to address these challenges. The motivation was also that collaborations between AI and ML researchers and NGOs could benefit both sides: on the one hand, the new techniques can help with prediction, data analysis, modelling, or decision making. On the other hand, the NGOs' domains contain many non-standard conditions, like missing data, side-effects, or multiple competing objectives, all of which are fascinating research challenges in themselves. And of course, publication impact is substantially enhanced when a method has real-world impact. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar facilitated the exploration of possible collaborations between AI and ML researchers and NGOs through a two-pronged approach. This approach combined high-level talks &amp; discussions on the one hand with a hands-on hackathon on the other hand. High-level talks &amp; discussions focused first on the central concepts and theories in AI and ML and in the NGOs\u2019 development work, before diving into specific issues such as privacy &amp; anonymity, data quality, intellectual property, accessibility and ethical issues. These talks and discussions allowed all participants - in a very short timeframe - to reach a sufficient level of understanding of each other's work. This understanding was the basis to then start investigating jointly through a hackathon how AI and ML could help addressing the real-world challenges presented by the NGOs. \nAt the start of the hackathon, an open marketplace-like setting allowed AI and ML researchers and NGOs to find the best match between technological supply and demand. When teams of researchers and NGOs were established, their initial objective was not to start coding, but to define objectives, assess scope and feasibility. Throughout the hackathon, group membership was fluid, as some projects finished early, were deemed out of scope, or needed to wait for data. Some groups managed to build a viable initial prototype, others established the seeds for future collaborations, and a few were proposed as full summer projects within the ``Data Science of Social Good summer school''. The projects' aims were diverse. They included better seeds for farmers, modelling cognitive age and decline, scalable legal assistance and scalable citizen feedback. As a result of the hackathon, all NGOs could take concrete results home - some to build on further, some as mature solutions.  \n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, a result of the seminar that is relevant for the entire AI for Social Good community are the ten key challenges for AI for Social Good initiatives that participants identified:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>the importance of deep, long-term partnerships, \n</li><li>clear and well-defined goals and use cases, \n</li><li> bias towards simpler solutions, \n</li><li> data readiness, \n</li><li> setting expectations with regards to both impact and the pace at which technology can be applied, \n</li><li> ensuring privacy and security of data, \n</li><li> inclusivity and ethics of the applications, \n</li><li> factoring in the limitations of both communities, \n</li><li> challenges in overcoming the barriers to NGOs utilising the potential of AI/ML, and \n</li><li> the relative cost of AI/ML for social good.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ruben De Winne\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAll living organism must be able to differentially regulate the expression of genes encoded in their genome. Genes are first transcribed into RNA, which are either translated to proteins or functionally active as non-coding RNAs. Beside the direct regulation of the transcription of DNA into RNA, an important additional layer is the direct regulation of RNAs by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). This layer of regulation controls cellular decisions as part of gene expression networks composed of both proteins and RNAs. While being a dark matter of the cell for a long time, recent years have shown the development of sophisticated high\nthroughput experimental technologies that greatly increased our understanding of\nprotein-RNA recognition and regulation. Nevertheless, the quantitative molecular understanding of the transcriptome-level processes remains very limited.

            "title": "Algebraic Methods in Computational Complexity",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar brought together more than 40 researchers covering a wide spectrum of complexity theory. The focus on algebraic methods showed the great importance of such techniques for theoretical computer science. We had 25 talks, most of them lasting about 40 minutes, leaving ample room for discussions. In the following we describe the major topics of discussion in more detail.\n</p> \n <h4>Circuit Complexity</h4> \n <p>This is an area of fundamental importance to Complexity.\nCircuit Complexity was one of the main topics in the seminar.\nStill it remains a big challenge to prove strong upper and lower bounds.\nAlso Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) plays a central role.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with a talk by <em>Steve Fenner</em>. In a breakthrough result, he showed how to solve the perfect matching problem in bipartite graphs (almost) efficiently in parallel, by circuits of quasi-polynomial size and O(log^2 n) depth (in quasi-NC). This solves a problem open since more than 30 years. <em>Rohit Gurjar</em>} showed how to extend the result even further to <em>linear matroid intersection</em>, where bipartite perfect matching is a special case of.\n</p> \n <p>\nBoth of the above results can be read as a singularity test of certain symbolic matrices. We had several talks dealing with determining singularity or computing the rank of a symbolic matrix. <em>Rafael Oliveira</em> presented an efficient algorithm for the symbolic singularity problem in the <em>non-commutative</em> setting. In the <em>commutative</em> setting, the complexity is a major open problem. Many other important problems reduce to it.\n<em>Markus Bl\u00e4ser</em> presented an <em>approximation algorithm</em> (PTAS) for the rank of a symbolic matrix. Surprisingly, this is achieved with a greedy-algorithm. <em>Kristoffer Hansen</em> showed a different kind of approximation for low rank binary matrices.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe have seen  some great work on <em>Polynomial Identity Testing</em> (PIT) \nand circuit lower bounds recently, in particular on depth-3 and depth 4 circuits, and on arithmetic branching programs, which has brought us very\nclose to statements that are known to imply VP not= VNP, the analogue of the P vs. NP question in the arithmetic world. With respect to PIT, an ambitious goal is  to come up with a hitting set construction for a specific model. A hitting set is a set of instances such that every  non-zero polynomial in the model has a non-root in the set. This would solve the PIT problem in the <em>black box</em> model.\n</p> \n <p>\nPIT is known to be efficiently solvable by <em>randomized</em> algorithms,\nfor example when we consider arithmetic circuits. Things get a bit different when we consider <em>noncummutative</em> circuits. Now the standard test cannot be directly applied because the polynomials can have exponential degree, and hence doubly exponentially many monomials. <em>V. Arvind</em> presented \na randomized polynomial identity test for noncommutative arithmetic circuits\nfor the case when the polynomial has only exponentially many monomials.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the most successful methods for proving lower bounds for arithmetic circuits is to consider the dimension of the span of the <em>partial derivatives</em> of a polynomial. <em>Pascal Koiran</em> considered the complexity of the problem to compute this dimension. He showed that it is #P-hard. It remained open whether the problem is #P-complete.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother important notion when proving lower bounds is the <em>algebraic independence</em> of arithmetic circuits. In 2015, Kumar and Saraf presented lower bounds and hitting sets for a class of depth-4 circuits that have low algebraic rank. Unfortunately, their technique requires base fields of characteristic zero, or at least exponentially large characteristic.\n<em>Nitin Saxena</em> closed this gap and showed how to make the approach work over <em>every</em> field.\n</p> \n <p><em>Michael Forbes</em> showed that lower bounds for certain algebraic circuits imply lower bounds in proof complexity.\n</p> \n <p><em>Or Meir</em> talked on one of the major open problems in complexity theory: proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of formulas.\nKarchmer, Raz, and Wigderson suggested an approach to this problem. The <em>KRW-conjecture</em> states that the formula complexity of two functions f and g roughly adds up when we consider the composed function gcirc f.\nThey showed that the conjecture implies super-polynomial formula lower bounds\nIn his talk, Or Meir did a step to prove the conjecture: he proved a special case, namely when f is the parity-function. His proof uses techniques from communication complexity.\n</p> \n <p>Valiant introduced the arithmetic analogue of classes P and NP.\nVery roughly, the class VP contains all multivariate polynomials that can be computed (non-uniformly) by polynomial-size arithmetic circuits,\nand the class VNP contains all multivariate polynomials that have coefficients\ncomputable by VP-circuits. The question whether VP is different from VNP\nplays the role of the P-NP question in algebraic complexity theory.\nValiant showed that the permanent is complete for VNP. But for VP, only artificially constructed functions were known to be complete. In her talk, <em>Meena Mahajan</em> described  several polynomial families complete for VP and for VNP, based on the notion of graph homomorphism polynomials. \n</p> \n <h4>Complexity</h4> \n <p>\nSince the famous AKS-primality test, prime numbers can be recognized efficiently. The <em>construction</em> of prime numbers is still a challenging task. The best known deterministic algorithm have only exponential running time. <em>Rahul Santhanam</em> presented a randomized subexponential time  algorithm that outputs primes, and only primes, with high probability,\nand moreover, the output is mostly the same prime. This is called a <em>zero-error pseudo-deterministic</em> algorithm.\n</p> \n <p>\nSince the famous Isolation Lemma of Mulmuley, Vazirani, Vazirani, researchers recognized the power of isolation. For example, the bipartite perfect matching and the matroid intersection algorithms mentioned above, both rely on isolating a minimum weight solution, <em>Nutan Limaye</em> studied the problem of isolating an s-t-path in a directed graph. She proved that a randomized logspace algorithm that isolates such a path can be used to show NL subseteq L/poly.\n</p> \n <p>\nDerandomization is an area where there are tight connections between lower bounds and algorithms. Strong enough circuit lower bounds can be used to construct pseudo-random generators that can then be used to simulate randomized algorithms with only polynomial overhead. The polynomial overhead is fine for algorithms running in polynomial time. However, in case of subexponential randomized algorithms, this overhead makes the resulting deterministic algorithm more or less useless. <em>Ronen Shaltiel</em> showed how to overcome this problem by achieving a more modest overhead. He needs, however, stronger lower bounds to begin with. Further talks on pseudo-random generators and randomness extractors were given by <em>Amnon Ta-Shma</em> and <em>William Hoza</em>.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Chris Umans</em> gave an evening talk presenting a recent breakthrough in additive combinatorics, the resolution of the so-called <em>cap-set conjecture</em> by Ellenberg and Gijswijt. This result has implications for the Cohn-Umans group-theoretic approach for matrix multiplication, and elsewhere in Complexity.\n</p> \n <h4>Coding Theory</h4> \n <p>Error-correcting codes, particularly those constructed from polynomials, i.e. Reed-Solomon codes or Reed-Muller codes, lie at the heart of many \nsignificant results in Computational Complexity. <em>Shubhangi Saraf</em> gave a talk on locally-correctable and locally-testable codes. <em>Swastik Kopparty</em> generalized the well known decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes to higher dimensions. He presented an efficient algorithm to decode Reed-Muller codes when  the evaluation points are an arbitrary product set S^m,\nfor some m, when S is larger than the degree of the polynomials. \n</p> \n <h4>Conclusion</h4> \n <p>As is evident from the list above, the talks ranged over a broad assortment of subjects with the underlying theme of using algebraic and combinatorial techniques. It was a very fruitful meeting and has hopefully initiated new directions in research. Several participants specifically mentioned that they appreciated the particular focus on a common class of <em>techniques</em> (rather than end results) as a unifying theme of the workshop. We look forward\nto our next meeting!\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Valentine Kabanets, Thomas Thierauf, Jacobo Tor\u00e1n, and Christopher Umans\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Reproducibility of Data-Oriented Experiments in e-Science",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIn many subfields of computer science, experiments play an important role. Besides theoretical properties of algorithms or methods, their effectiveness and performance often can only be validated via experimentation. In most of these cases, the experimental results depend on the input data, settings for input parameters, and potentially on characteristics of the computational environment where the experiments were designed and run. Unfortunately, most computational experiments are specified only informally in papers, where experimental results are briefly described in figure captions; the code that produced the results is seldom available. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis has serious implications. Scientific discoveries do not happen in isolation. Important advances are often the result of sequences of smaller, less significant steps. In the absence of results that are fully documented, reproducible, and generalizable, it becomes hard to re-use and extend these results. Besides hindering the ability of others to leverage our work, and consequently limiting the impact of our field, the absence of reproducibility experiments also puts our reputation at stake, since reliability and validity of empiric results are basic scientific principles.\n</p> \n <p>\nReproducible results are not just beneficial to others -- in fact, they bring many direct benefits to the researchers themselves. Making an experiment reproducible forces the researcher to document execution pathways. This in turn enables the pathways to be analyzed (and audited). It also helps newcomers (e.g., new students and post-docs) to get acquainted with the problem and tools used. Furthermore, reproducibility facilitates portability, which simplifies the dissemination of the results. Last, but not least, preliminary evidence exists that reproducibility increases impact, visibility and research quality.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, attaining reproducibility for computational experiments is challenging. It is hard both for authors to derive a compendium that encapsulates all the components (e.g., data, code, parameter settings, environment) needed to reproduce a result, and for reviewers to verify the results. There are also other barriers, from practical issues -- including the use of proprietary data, software and specialized hardware, to social -- for example, the lack of incentives for authors to spend the extra time making their experiments reproducible.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought together experts from various sub-fields of Computer Science as well as experts from several scientific domains to create a joint understanding of the problems of reproducibility of experiments, discuss existing solutions and impediments, and propose ways to overcome current limitations.\n</p> \n <p>\nBeyond a series of short presentations of tools, state of the art of reproducibility in various domains and \"war stories\" of things not working, participants specifically explored ways forward to overcome barriers to the adoption of reproducibility. A series of break-out sessions gradually built on top of each other, (1) identifying different types of repeatability and their merits; (2) the actors involved and the incentives and barriers they face; (3) guidelines for actors (specifically editors, authors and reviewers) on how to determine the level of reproducibility of papers and the merits of reproduction papers; and (4) the specific challenges faced by user-oriented experimentation in Information Retrieval. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis led to the definition of according typologies and guidelines as well as identification of specific open research problems. We defined a set of actions to reach out to stakeholders, notably publishers and funding agencies as well as identifying follow-up liaison with various reproducibility task forces in different communities including the ACM, FORCE11, STM, Science Europe.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe key message resulting from this workshop, copied from and elaborated in more detail in Section 6.5 is:\n</p> \n <p>\n<cite><em>Transparency, openness, and reproducibility are vital features of science. Scientists embrace these features as disciplinary norms and values, and it follows that they should be integrated into daily research activities. These practices give confidence in the work; help research as a whole to be conducted at a higher standard and be undertaken more efficiently; provide verifiability and falsifiability; and encourage a community of mutual cooperation. They also lead to a valuable form of paper, namely, reports on evaluation and reproduction of prior work. Outcomes that others can build upon and use for their own research, whether a theoretical construct or a reproducible experimental result, form a foundation on which science can progress. Papers that are structured and presented in a manner that facilitates and encourages such post-publication evaluations benefit from increased impact, recognition, and citation rates.</em>\n<em>Experience in computing research has demonstrated that a range of straightforward mechanisms can be employed to encourage authors to produce reproducible work. These include: requiring an explicit commitment to an intended level of provision of reproducible materials as a routine part of each paper\u2019s structure; requiring a detailed methods section; separating the refereeing of the paper\u2019s scientific contribution and its technical process; and explicitly encouraging the creation and reuse of open resources (data, or code, or both).</em>\n</cite>\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Juliana Freire, Norbert Fuhr, and Andreas Rauber\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 17221 \"Geometric Modelling, Interoperability and New Challenges\". \n</p> \n <p>\nThe importance of accurate geometric models of shapes, both naturally occurring and man-made, is rapidly growing with the maturing of novel manufacturing technologies and novel analysis technologies. The advent of big data challenges and cloud-based computing serves to confound the distribution and remote access of these geometric models. While previous Dagstuhl seminars on geometric modeling were focused on basic research, this seminar was focused on applications of geometric modeling. We selected four core application areas that stretch the underlying mathematical underpinnings of the discipline to its limits and beyond:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Big data and Cloud computing \n</li><li> Multi-material additive manufacturing (3D Printing) \n</li><li> Isogeometric analysis \n</li><li> Design optimization\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar provided a forum for leading researchers to present new ideas, to exchange scientific insights, and to bring together practical applications and basic research. The previous seminar explored the theory of shape representations, shape transformations, and computational models for each. This seminar explored application of this theory to the four above-mentioned application challenges, strengthening the reliability and performance of applications in engineering, manufacturing, and scientific exploration. The goal of the seminar was to establish a common understanding between the Geometric Modeling research community and the above application fields by addressing the following questions: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How to handle geometric descriptions that cannot be processed by one computer but have to be distributed among many computers in the cloud?\n</li><li> How to process huge 3D data sets that may be noisy and incomplete into clean, scalable, and easy to access 3D environments?\n</li><li> How to turn big, dispersed maybe noisy and incomplete geometric data into clean, scalable, and easy to access 3D information that can be used for change detection and decision making?\n</li><li> How to represent, control, and process complex, anisotropic, internal material enabled by additive manufacturing, and how to design for additive manufacturing?\n</li><li> How to perform topology optimization of the internal structure of objects to enable additive manufacturing to reach its full potential?\n</li><li> How to introduce analysis-based design in CAD systems with isogeometric analysis in mind?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nTo answer these questions we brought together participants from industry urgently in need of better solutions, researchers in the application areas represented by the four topics, and researchers in the geometric modeling community whose interests align with the four topic areas. The scientific presentations lasted 15 to 20 minutes. Senior researchers gave 4 overview talks on the 4 themes of the seminar. Perspective working groups were organized for each of the four topics.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Falai Chen, Tor Dokken, Thomas A.

This is true in particular of proof\nassistants based on dependent types, probably due in part to the\nadvent of homotopy type theory, developed in the proof assistants Coq,\nAgda and Lean.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe audience of the seminar was thus rather unusual in composition,\nand featured several experienced researchers used to attending\nseminars at the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, and\nvisiting Schloss Dagstuhl for the first time.  In order to foster\ndiscussion and fuse collaborations, we adopted a different format from\nthe standard string of slide-based talks: talks in the morning, so\nthat people get to know the work of each other, and working in groups\nin the afternoon.  At the end of each day, before dinner, each group\npresented a summary of the outcomes of their meetings to all\nparticipants, which allowed inter-group discussion and collaboration.\nThis had been tried before by some of the organizers, in the course of\nDagstuhl seminar 16112, and worked just as well in our case.\n</p> \n <p>\nWorking group topics were proposed by the audience on the first day,\nby giving short presentations of a few minutes and writing topics in\nthe board.

            "data": "\n <p>\nDriven by new functionality and applications (such as automated driving and vehicle-to-X-connectivity) and fueled by the entry of new players from the IT industry, automotive systems are currently undergoing a radical shift in the way they are designed, implemented, and deployed. The trend towards automation and connectivity imposes an increased complexity and requires unprecedented computing resources, while, at the same time, the demanding requirements regarding cost-efficiency and dependability still need to be fulfilled. One of the most visible changes is the integration of formerly separated function domains onto centralized computing platforms. This leads to a heterogeneous mix of applications with different models of computation (e.g., control, stream processing, and cognition) on heterogeneous, specialized hardware platforms (comprising, e.g., application cores, safety cores, GPUs, deep learning accelerators) to accommodate advanced functionalities such as automated driving and on-line optimization of operating strategies for electrified powertrains.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe adoption of these novel heterogeneous platforms raises several challenges. In particular, many of their components stem from embedded consumer devices and have never been designed for application in safety-critical real-time systems. Therefore, while their computational capabilities are well understood, there is an increased need to comprehend these platforms from the perspective of extra-functional requirements such as predictability, determinism, and freedom-from-interference. This process deeply impacts the core design aspects of automotive E/E architectures and heavily challenges established methods and methodologies in HW/SW automotive design.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to gather researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss key industrial challenges, existing solutions and research directions in the HW/SW design of future automotive platforms. The seminar focussed, in particular, on\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>predictability of systems regarding extra-functional properties,\n</li><li> safe integration of hardware and software components and\n</li><li>programmability and optimization of emerging heterogeneous platforms.\n</li></ul> \n <p>These inter-dependent challenges require the interaction between multiple disciplines, combining resource-constrained embedded, cyber-physical, and real-time aspects. Another important aspect of the seminar was to provide insight into novel automotive functionalities (such as automated driving, online optimization, or over-the-air-update) and their software architectures and requirements as well as into the HW/SW platforms they are executed on. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar provided a unique opportunity for participants from the automotive industry to present their challenges and constraints and receive feedback and ideas from academia. At the same time, it allowed researchers to confront their own ideas and/or solutions with industrial reality and together identify new research directions in order to make an impact in the automotive industry.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization of the seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar took place from 8th to 11th December 2019. The seminar started with an overview of current trends and challenges in the design of future automotive HW/SW platforms by the organizers. After that the agenda was structured along the previously mentioned challenges. Monday's talk sessions were focused on dependability and predictability of HW/SW systems. The sessions on Tuesday dealt with the safe integration of heterogeneous software applications covering aspects of software architectures, networks and cyber-physical systems in the automotive domain and touched societal issues as well. On Wednesday, the talks focused on the programmability and optimization of heterogeneous platforms. All talks were restricted to 15 minutes, leaving ample time for discussions as well as breakout sessions on the following topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Modeling hardware and software dependencies\n</li><li> Weakly hard real-time models\n</li><li>Machine learning in cyber-physical systems\n </li><li> HW/SW architecture exchange\n</li><li> Benchmarking efforts for future HW/SW platforms\n</li><li> Modularizing control systems\n</li><li> Automotive software lifecycle\n</li><li> Programming vs. execution models\n</li></ul> \n <p>More details on breakout sessions are available in a dedicated section of this document, after the overview of the talks given during the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcome</h3> \n <p>The seminar succeeded in bringing together participants from different communities who were engaged in very intensive, interdisciplinary group discussions. Not surprisingly, many participants stated that they were able to learn a lot from adjacent fields. As many of the industrial challenges at hand require interdisplinary approaches, the organizers consider this a significant success of the seminar. One example that became evident during the course of the seminar was that terms like execution model are quite differently used in e.g. the high performance computing domain and in the embedded systems community. A group formed in one of the breakout sessions intends to write a whitepaper on unifying terminology and formulating a common understanding of the different layers of models used in designing automotive HW/SW systems. A first follow-up meeting already took place in February 2020.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral industrial presentations gave valuable insights in the industrial state-of-the-practice and outlined challenges for future research. A very good example for this was the breakout session ``HW/SW Architecture Exchange'' which discussed current architectural patterns and open challenges in the context of designing dependable systems and achieving deterministic behavior on heterogeneous high-performance HW platforms. \n</p> \n <p>\nAnother breakout session provided an overview of current automotive benchmarks and performance models that can be used as a basis for research activities. This session also raised the awareness that industry needs to be more active in providing relevant benchmarks in order to enable researchers to validate the industrial viability of their solutions.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the feedback of the participants showed that they made a lot of new contacts in academia and industry and a follow-up seminar in about two years was requested by many participants. The seminar inspired several new collaborations including contributions to the Autonomous Systems Design workshop at DATE 2020, ideas for special sessions at DAC 2020 and ESWEEK 2020 and also a student project on automotive HW/SW platform simulation between a students' project group and an industrial partner.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Dirk Ziegenbein, Selma Saidi, Xiaobo Sharon Hu, and Sebastian Steinhorst\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Automated Algorithm Selection and Configuration",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe importance of high-performance algorithms, in particular for solving  NP-hard optimisation and decision problems, cannot be underestimated. Achievements in this area have substantial impact in sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, finance, agriculture and energy systems --  all of strategic importance to modern societies.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe development of effective automated algorithm selection and configuration techniques has been one of the major success stories in the area of empirical algorithmics in recent years. Building on a wide range of algorithmic approaches for problems such as propositional satisfiability (SAT) and mixed integer programming (MIP), these methods permit the selection of appropriate algorithms based on efficiently computable characteristic of a problem instance to be solved (algorithm selection) and the automatic determination of performance optimising parameter settings (algorithm configuration). In both cases, statistical models that enable performance predictions for previously unseen problem instances or parameter settings play a key enabling role; additionally, these models have other important uses, e.g., in load scheduling and distribution on large computer clusters.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe reach of those methods is illustrated by the fact that they have defined the state of the art in solving SAT, arguably the most prominent NP-complete decision problem, for a decade (as witnessed by the results from the international SAT solver competitions, and more recently have been demonstrated to have the potential to achieve significant improvements over the long-standing state of the art in solving the TSP, one of the most widely studied NP-hard optimisation problems [1]\nFurther very encouraging results have been achieved in recent years for continuous optimisation, AI planning and mixed integer programming problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of the seminar was to foster research on algorithm selection and configuration, as well as on the underlying performance prediction methods, by bringing together researchers from the areas of artificial intelligence, theoretical computer science and machine learning  in order to extend current studies to a much broader class of problems and build up the theoretical foundations of this important research area. On the foundational side, the seminar aimed at bridging the gap between experiments and theory in feature-based algorithm (runtime) analysis. In particular, we began investigating how mathematical and theoretical analyses can contribute to the experimentally driven research area of algorithm selection and configuration. We expect that studies following this initial exploration will bring together two of the currently most successful approaches for analysing heuristic search algorithms and ultimately achieve substantial impact in academic and industrial applications of algorithm configuration and selection techniques. Furthermore, we placed an emphasis on investigating automated algorithm selection and configuration approaches for multiobjective optimisation problems  -- an important, but largely unexplored area of investigation.\n</p> \n <h3>Background and Challenges: Algorithm Selection and Configuration for Combinatorial  Problems</h3> \n <p>The design of algorithms for combinatorial optimisation and decision problems plays a key role in theoretical computer science as well as in applied algorithmics. These problems are frequently tackled using heuristic methods that perform extremely well on different classes of benchmark instances but usually do not have rigorous performance guarantees. Algorithm selection and configuration techniques have been applied to some of the most prominent NP-hard combinatorial optimisation and decision problems, such as propositional satisfiability (SAT) and the travelling salesman problem (TSP).\n</p> \n <p>\nAlgorithm selection for SAT has first been explored in the seminal work on SATzilla [2,3,4] which was initially based on linear and ridge regression methods for performance prediction, but later moved to more sophisticated models based on cost-sensitive random forest classification [5]. Other successful methods use clustering techniques to identify the algorithm to be run on a given instance [6,7]. As clearly evident from the results of SAT competitions, which are regularly held to assess and document the state of the art in SAT solving, automated algorithm selection procedures effectively leverage the complementary strengths of different high-performance solvers and thus achieve substantial improvements over the best individual solvers [5].\n</p> \n <p>\nAs heuristic search algorithms often have numerous parameters that influence their performance, one of the classical questions is how to set parameters to optimise performance on a given class of instances. This per-set algorithm configuration problems can be solved using stochastic local search and model-based optimisation techniques [8,9,10], as well as racing techniques [11,12], and these configuration methods have been demonstrated to yield substantial performance improvements to state-of-the-art algorithms for SAT, TSP, MIP, AI planning and several other problems (see, e.g, [13,14,15,16]). Algorithm configuration techniques are now routinely used for optimising the empirical performance of solvers for a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence, operations research and many application areas (see, e.g., [17,18])\n</p> \n <p>\nInitial work on combining algorithm selection and configuration techniques has shown significant promise [19,20]; such combinations allow configuring algorithms on a per-instance basis [6,7] and configuring algorithm selection methods (which themselves make use of many heuristic design choices) [21]. However, we see much room for further work along these lines. Other challenges concern the automated selection and configuration of mechanisms that adapt parameter settings while an algorithm is running and the configuration of algorithms for optimised scaling behaviour. Finally, a better theoretical foundation of algorithm selection and configuration approaches is desired and necessary. Initial steps into this direction were an important goal of this Dagstuhl seminar. In the following, we motivate and outline some of the challenges addressed in the course of the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Background and Challenges: Algorithm Selection for Continuous Black-Box Optimisation</h3> \n <p>Black-box function optimisation is a basic, yet intensely studied model for general optimisation tasks, where all optimisation parameters are real-valued. Work in this area has important practical applications in parameter and design optimisation and has also inspired some of the most successful general-purpose algorithm configuration techniques currently available [9].\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite many years of research in metaheuristics, especially evolutionary algorithms, aimed at optimising black-box functions effectively, it is currently hardly possible to automatically determine a good optimisation algorithm for a given black-box function, even if some of its features are known. In single-objective (SO) black-box optimisation, it is therefore of considerable interest to derive rules for determining how problem properties influence algorithm performance as well as for grouping test problems into classes for which similar performance of the optimisation algorithms can be observed. Recent benchmarking experiments [22,23] provide at best  high-level guidelines for choosing a suitable algorithm type based on basic features that are known a priori, such as the number of dimensions of the given problem. However, the preference rules for algorithm selection thus obtained are very imprecise, and even for slight algorithm or problem variations, the resulting performance-induced ordering of different algorithms can change dramatically. \n</p> \n <p>\nExploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA, [24]) aims at improving this situation by deriving cheaply computable problem features based on which models relating features to algorithm performance can be constructed using benchmark experiments. The final goal is an accurate prediction of the best suited algorithm for an arbitrary optimisation problem based on the computed features. The concept is not entirely knew; however, earlier approaches, such as fitness distance correlation (FDC) [25], have not been completely convincing.\n</p> \n <p>\nA first idea to employ high-level (human expert designed) features, such as separability and modality, to characterize optimisation problems in an ELA context [26] was therefore refined by also integrating low-level features - e.g., based on convexity or the behaviour of local search procedures [27].\nThese effectively computable low-level features can be chosen from a wide range of easy to measure statistical properties. Suitably determined combinations of such features are expected to provide sufficient information to enable successful algorithm selection. Following recent results [27], this process is not necessarily costly in terms of function evaluations required for feature computation.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdditional, conceptually similar features were introduced in [28,29,30,31].\nIn [32], a representative portfolio of four optimisation algorithms was constructed from the complete list of BBOB 2009/2010 candidates. Based on the low-level features a sufficiently accurate prediction of the best suited algorithm within the portfolio for each function was achieved. Recently, the feature set was extended based on the cell mapping concept in [33] by which a finite subdivision of the domain in terms of hypercubes is constructed.\nMost recently, the ELA approach, extended by several specific features, was successfully used to experimentally detect funnel structured landscapes in unknown black-box optimisation problems [34]. As it can be assumed that this information can be efficiently exploited to speed up the optimisation process, we expect ELA to contribute importantly to automated algorithm selection in single-objective black-box optimisation. (See [35] for a survey of related work.)\n</p> \n <p>\nOne major challenge in this area is the construction of a suitable algorithm portfolio together with an algorithm selection mechanism for unknown instances that generalises well to practical applications. For this purpose, suitable benchmark sets have to be derived and the costs of feature computations have to be kept as small as possible. Furthermore, theoretical foundation of the approaches is desired and necessary. The seminar aimed to make first steps in this direction.\n</p> \n <h3>Special focus: Algorithm selection for multiobjective optimisation</h3> \n <p>\nSome of the most challenging real-world problems involve the systematic and simultaneous optimisation of multiple conflicting objective functions -- for example, maximising product quality and manufacturing efficiency, while minimising production time and material waste. To solve such problems, a large number of multiobjective optimisation (MOO) algorithms has been reported. Like single-objective (SO) algorithms, new MOO algorithms are claimed to outperform others by comparing the results over a limited set of test problems. Knowles et al. [36] started working on systematically deriving performance measures for EMOA and evaluating EMOA performance. Mersmann et al. [37] recently derived a systematic benchmarking framework according to similar work of [38] on benchmarking classification algorithms. \n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, it is unlikely that any algorithm would outperform all others on a broader set of problems, and it is possible that the algorithm fails miserably on some of them. These results go usually unreported, leaving the algorithm\u2019s limitations unknown. This knowledge is crucial to avoid deployment disasters, gain theoretical insights to improve algorithm design, and ensure that algorithm performance is robustly described. Therefore, we see much value in the development of an algorithm selection and configuration framework for multiobjective optimisation. Successfully selecting the proper optimization algorithm for a multi-objective problem depends on detecting different problem characteristics, one of which is the multimodality of the induced landscape. In recent work [39], formal definitions were introduced for multimodality in multi-objective optimization problems in order to generalize the ELA framework to multi-objective optimization.\n</p> \n <p>\nSignificant progress has been made on single-objective (SO) problems of combinatorial and continuous nature as discussed above. However, these ideas are yet to be applied to the important class of MOO problems. We see five major avenues of exploration: (1) analysis on what makes MOO problems difficult; (2) design of features to numerically characterize MOO problems; (3) identification and visualization of strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art MOO algorithms; (4) methodology to assist the algorithm selection and configuration on (possibly expensive) real-world problems; (5) methodology to assist the design of tailored algorithms for real-world problems. An important aim of the seminar was to facilitate discussion of these directions.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar structure and outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar was structured to balance short invited presentations with group breakout sessions and a generous amount of time set aside for informal discussions and spontaneously organised working groups at a ratio of about 2:1:1. Based on feedback obtained during and after the event, this structure worked well in fostering a vibrant atmosphere of intense and fruitful exchange and discussion. Presenters very successfully introduced important ideas, outlined recent results and open challenges, and facilitated lively discussion that provided much additional value. The afternoon group breakout sessions were particularly effective in addressing the challenges previously outlined as well as additional topics of interest that emerged during the seminar -- thanks to the preparation and moderation by the session organisers as well as the lively participation of the attendees.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile it would be unreasonable to expect to exhaustively or conclusively address the substantial research challenges that inspired us to organise this Dagstuhl seminar, we believe that very significant progress has been achieved. As importantly, we feel that through this week-long event, an invaluable sharing of perspective and ideas has taken place, whose beneficial effects on the algorithm selection and configuration community and its work we hope to be felt for years to come. The following presentation abstracts and session summaries provided by the participants reflect the richness and depth of the scientific exchange facilitated by the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs organisers, we very much enjoyed working with presenters and session organisers, who greatly contributed to the success of the seminar, as did everyone who participated. Our thanks also go to the local team at Schloss Dagstuhl, who provided outstanding organisational support and a uniquely inspiring environment.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>L.

            "title": "Visualization Empowerment: How to Teach and Learn Data Visualization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar set out to discuss timely issues and approaches to teaching and education in data visualization. The topic is of growing importance in a world where more and more content is being shared through online news and social media. Our mission as researchers, practitioners and educators in data visualization is to assure quality education for everyone engaging with visualization; this ranges from visualization designers, data scientists, school teachers, journalists, working professionals, students, as well as general public audiences. Teaching visualization is tricky for a range of reasons: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Data visalization is a skill that is only slowly starting to make its way into school curricula (at least in some countries); </li>\n<li> While the <b>range of visualization tools</b> available makes it easy for almost anyone to create visualizations regardless of their technical background, it can be overwhelming to know where to start and to navigate this ever-growing and changing tool landscape; </li>\n<li> Data visualization is a highly interdisciplinary field, influenced and moved forward by psychology, cognitive science, design, computer science, data science, art, and many more disciplines. As a result, <b>learning objectives and teaching practices greatly vary</b>;</li>\n<li> There is currently <b>no defined agreement on the learning goals and criteria</b> for visualization literacy. For example, what defines a beginner, intermediate, professional in data visualization? What aspects of data visualization should be taught at different levels? And: how can we assess visualization skills?;</li>\n<li> From a learner perspective, the motivation to pick up visualization as a skill is broad: some people \"just\" want to use a specific tool to get things done quickly, others pursue a design approach (no coding language required), others want to build systems for visualization (Computer Sciences), others go on and become educators or researchers;</li>\n<li> Visualization is important in many domains and knowledge and specific solutions might be specific to these domains, rather than valid universally (e.g., color choices, symbolic conventions, level of interactivity);</li>\n<li> There are a lot of <b>tacit knowledge and skills</b> involved in visualization which can be difficult to pin down and transform into learning activities.</li>\n</ul> \n <p>In order to discuss these challenges and how to navigate them, we invited participants from academia and industry, including senior and junior thinkers. </p> \n <h4>Participants &amp; Seminar Format</h4> \n <p>Given the highly interdisciplinary field of data visualization and visualization literacy, participants covered a range of expertises including the fields of design, computer science, human-computer interaction, education, graphics, and cognitive psychology. The 5-day seminar was run in a hybrid format with 28 participants joining us at Schloss Dagstuhl in-person, 7 participants joining us online synchronously from Europe, and 6 participants joining us asynchronously from North America. Two organizers were on-site at Schloss Dagstuhl, while two joined the seminar remotely (one synchronously and one asynchronously). One of the online organizers led the asynchronous North America group from Canada. All seminar participants (synchronous and asynchronous) met for a daily debriefing session at 5pm local (Dagstuhl) time to share their progress and discussions. The synchronous remote participants (Europe) joined different local discussion groups through online calls, which did work out surprisingly well - <em>special thanks to the Dagstuhl technical team for the amazing help with the hybrid setup</em>.\n</p> \n <h4>Seminar Structure &amp; Activities</h4> \n <p> The seminar followed an open-ended approach with respect to the possible outcomes, to allow discussion topics to emerge and develop, based on participants' expertise and interests. Discussions were sparked by brief talks and visualization activities led by selected participants. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe <b>seminar talks</b> included presentations on visualization teaching and learning with children, a syntactic analytical framework for visualization, engaging new students with visualization, using forums to engage students with visualization content, how to approach and streamline large-scale assessment of university students' visualization projects, as well as an overview over a book project from a past Dagstuhl Seminar (find the complete list and abstracts of talks in Section 5).\n</p> \n <p>\nFrom a practical end, the <b>visualization activities</b> invited seminar participants to actively engage in and experience a number of visualization teaching methods and techniques (see section 6 for more details). One activity invited participants to sketch their relation to the seminar topic in order to introduce participants to each other and to start immersing them into the seminar topic. Another activity asked participants to analyze a given visualization systematically. In one activity, we classified existing visualization activities that were submitted by participants prior to the seminar. Another activity took a speculative approach to visualization, inspiring critical visualization scenarios and designs through a card game.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere was ample time to discuss topics of interests through <b>breakout groups</b> which focused on topics related to </p> \n <ul>\n<li> Teaching methods and taxonomies for educational activities;</li>\n<li>  Teaching creativity and criticality for visualization; </li>\n<li>  Data physicalization and how corresponding methods can be used for education and engagement; </li>\n<li>  Practical approaches to teaching visualization and the politics involved in teaching visualization;</li>\n<li>  Approaches to visualization teaching and creation inspired by improvisation in the arts, and eventually; </li>\n<li>  Grand challenges in visualization education. </li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nFrom an organizer perspective, the seminar was a great success. All participants - both on-site and online - were extremely engaged, and we obtained very positive feedback. Participants appreciated the creative and open-ended nature of this seminar that invited for sharing and reflection of practices from different disciplines and perspectives. The seminar produced a long list of outcomes ranging from paper outlines and book projects, to collecting teaching manifestos and taxonomies, to grant projects and platforms for sharing teaching tools and resources. The plan emerged to establish a reoccurring international symposium around visualization education as part of the IEEE VIS conference, the largest annual conference on visualization with over 1000 participants. The individual working groups will move their individual goals forwards after the seminar. As organizers, we will coordinate between groups and support each of the projects as best as we can, e.g., through regular check-ins with the workgroup leaders as well as townhouse meetings with all Dagstuhl participants, e.g., once a semester. We all believe strongly that this Dagstuhl Seminar - the first formal event on visualization education besides smaller conference workshops -- has created a strong momentum for visualization empowerment and education, and we are looking forward to sharing our outcomes on a dedicated website soon.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Benjamin Bach, Samuel Huron, Uta Hinrichs, and Sheelagh Carpendale\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nWe began by having survey talks on four research threads that had laid foundations of such models. Specifically, Ran Canetti presented his Universal Composability model, Dennis Hofheinz presented his work on the GNUC model, Ralf K\u00fcsters presented his IITM/iUC model, and Ueli Maurer presented the model of Constructive Cryptography.\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing these tutorials, we had several talks on how specific security goals and protocols are modeled and proved secure.  Bj\u00f6rn Tackmann presented a way to model a zero-knowledge proof protocol that made statements about knowledge of certain inputs to ideal functionalities.  Manu Drijvers presented a way to model the global random oracle that can be used by participants in different protocols in a composable way.\n</p> \n <p>\nOnce the details of the specific models and how to use them were fresh in everyone's minds, we split up into working groups.  In order to do this, we first had a discussion on what problems we believed were worth tackling; we proposed many problems, and then agreed to discuss a subset of them.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThe topics explored by the working groups are discussed in detail below, in the \"results\" section of this report.  The following additional topics were proposed for discussion (but were not discussed):\n</p> <ul>\n<li>Model asynchrony and time\n</li><li>Anonymous communication\n</li><li>Global random oracles in CC\n</li><li>Secure Message Transfer in various model\n</li><li>Concrete security in UC/IITM\n</li><li>Finalise F_sig (with reasons why certain choices are better than others)\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAdditionally, we had several talks on recent and ongoing research projects. \nMarc Fischlin on composition of key agreement; Markulf Kohlweiss on structuring game-based proofs; Ran Cohen on probabilistic termination in cryptographic protocols; Antigoni Polychandrou presented two-round two-party computation; Vassilis Zikas modeling the public ledger functionality; Ran Canetti talking about using the EasyCrypt software to aid in cryptographic proofs and verification.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following is a summary of the workshop results:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>The relationship between the UC and IITM model was intensively discussed, concluding that the models are very close and that it is possible to unify the two models. The unification also seamlessly includes JUC, GUC, and SUC. \n</li><li>\nThe working group on SNARKs (recursive composition of succinct proofs) achieved initial modeling success and crystallization of what's actually challenging.\n</li><li>\nThe working group on modeling F_vrf and constricting it from F_sig, F_ro figured out what the stumbling blocks were and what was fundamental.\n</li><li>\nThe working group on F_NIZK and proofs about signatures in Constructive Crypto started to model typical UC functionality in the Constructive Crypto framework and then inspected how they could be composed.\n</li><li>\nThe working group on building threshold primitives from single primitive (e.g. threshold signatures from signatures, threshold encryption from encryption etc) came up with a candidate for a \"thresholdizer\" functionality, and found some subtleties in defining threshold behavior in the ideal world. The also found a </li><li>\nThe working group on setup assumptions analyzed the assumptions used for constructing composable protocols in terms of practicality and security provided.\n</li><li>\nThe working group on delegating secret keys - discovered a simple interface that can be added to F_sig to make it possible to delegate from one user to another well-defined user. Next steps are to investigate if it generalizes to other functionalities and to delegation that's based on knowledge transfer rather than explicit authorization of identity.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jan Camenisch, Ralf K\u00fcsters, Anna Lysyanskaya, and Alessandra Scafuro\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Foundations of Unsupervised Learning",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe success of Machine Learning methods for prediction crucially depends on  data preprocessing such as building a suitable feature representation.\nWith the recent explosion of data availability, there is a growing tendency to \"let the data speak itself\". Thus, unsupervised learning is often employed as a a first step in data analysis to build a good feature representation, but also, more generally, to detect patterns and regularities independently of any specific prediction task. There is a wide rage of tasks frequently performed for these purposes such as representation learning, feature extraction, outlier detection, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, clustering and latent variable models.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe outcome of such an unsupervised learning step has far reaching effects. The quality of a feature representation will affect the quality of a predictor learned based on this representation, a learned model of the data generating process may lead to conclusions about causal relations, a data mining method applied to a database of people may identify certain groups of individuals as \"suspects\" (for example of being prone to developing a specific disease or of being likely to commit certain crimes).\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, in contrast to the well-developed theory of supervised learning, currently systematic analysis of unsupervised learning tasks is scarce and our understanding of the subject is rather meager. It is therefore more than timely to put effort into developing solid foundations for unsupervised learning methods. It is important to understand and be able to analyze the validity of conclusions being drawn from them. The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to foster the development of a solid and useful theoretical foundation for unsupervised machine learning tasks.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar hosted academic researchers from the fields of theoretical computer science and statistics as well as some researchers from industry. Bringing together experts from a variety of backgrounds, highlighted the many facets of unsupervised learning. The seminar included a number of technical presentations and discussions about the state of the art of research on statistical and computational analysis of unsupervised learning tasks. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe have held lively discussions concerning the development of objective criteria for the evaluation of unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering. These converged to a consensus that such universal criteria cannot exist and that there is need to incorporate specific domain expertise to develop different objectives for different intended uses of the clusterings.\nConsequently, there was a debate concerning ways in which theoretical research could build useful tools for practitioners to assist them in choosing suitable methods for their tasks. One promising direction for progress towards better alignment of algorithmic objectives with application needs is the development of paradigms for interactive algorithms for such unsupervised learning tasks, that is, learning algorithms that incorporate adaptive \"queries\" to a domain expert. The seminar included presentations and discussions of various frameworks for the development of such active algorithms as well as tools for analysis of their benefits.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe believe, the seminar was a significant step towards further collaborations between different research groups with related but different views on the topic. A very active interchange of ideas took place and participants expressed their satisfactions of having gained new insights into directions of research relevant to their own.\nAs a group, we developed a higher level perspective of the important challenges that research of unsupervised learning is currently facing.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Shai Ben-David and Ruth Urner \n                </div> \n",

            "title": "New Challenges in Parallelism",
            "data": "\n <p>\nImproving the performance and reliability of parallel and concurrent programs is an ongoing topic in multiprocessor software and hardware research.\nDespite numerous efforts, the semantics of weak memory models remains subtle and fragile. There has not been established a generally accepted way of defining their semantics, and the specifications of programming languages supporting weak memory models with shared accesses are clearly inadequate.\nIn addition, new advances in hardware are adding further complexity.\nFor example, recently, non-volatile memory (NVM) generated a lot of interest in different communities: Hardware designers coming up with instruction sets and layouts of NVM, system designers integrating NVM into the storage stack, programming language designers proposing library interfaces, and theoreticians developing a new theory of persistence under concurrent access and algorithms adapted for persistency. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar on \"Future Challenges in Parallelism\" touched on different aspects on topics in this broad area of research.\nIn this report, we briefly give a summary of the presentations and discussions that took place during the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nPresentations started with an introductory broad overview talk on the non-volatile memory technology. This survey was followed by shorter talks ranging from hardware techniques for efficiently controlling write-back ordering from caches to theoretical foundations and design of specific data structures.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere was agreement that non-volatile memory is likely to become commercially important in the near future, and that it is tempting to exploit it to provide persistence of user data structures. However, there was little agreement on detailed assumptions and direction. The emphasis of the presentations was on manually designed data structures programmed to a near-hardware-level interface. Some participants expressed concerns that this was too low-level and that the community should instead focus on constructs at the level of durable transactions. Transactional semantics are likely to play an important role: When restarting an application from its persisted state, this state must be consistent in order to prevent data corruption and loss.\nMuch of the work presented in the workshop assumed that we will have non-volatile memory combined with visibly volatile caches that require explicit flush operations to persist data. But it was pointed out that the problem could be greatly simplified by either providing sufficient battery backup to ensure that the entire cache is flushed on failure, or providing other hardware support.\n</p> \n <p>\nSome of the participants discussed the definitions of correctness. On the one hand, the standard definition of durable linearizability is a strong requirement that typically brings a large performance overhead. On the other hand, the weaker buffered linearizability does not compose well. Other participants suggested some hardware modifications that could make the life of the programmer easier. For example, a discussion emerged on whether we could pin a cache line to make sure it is not written back to memory. We also tackled the programmability of systems with non-volatile memories. How difficult should it be to program them? Are application programmers expected to employ it directly or only via dedicated data structures provided in libraries? The experience report of porting the application memcached to non-volatile memory raised a lot of interest with the participants. It turned out that the task was rather difficult due to complex interactions between the different modules in the application, in particular between modules that required persistence and modules that did not. The lack of tools was strongly felt, and the obtained performance was not satisfactory. The conclusion was that applications had better be redesigned from scratch to work with non-volatile memory. The general feeling at the end of the seminar was that we are in the beginning of exciting times for research on non-volatile memories and that the discussions must and will continue.\n</p> \n <p>\nMemory models formed the second major thread of presentations and discussions, with participants expressing widely different viewpoints and technical directions. At one extreme, Madan Musuvathi presented evidence that a simple interleaving-based \"sequentially consistent\" semantics can be provided at reasonable cost, together with an argument that this is a good direction for future programming languages. At the other extreme, Viktor Vafeiadis argued that a weaker \"acquire-release\" memory model is easier to reason about, an argument that was backed up by model-checking time measurements. Needless to say, this was followed by lively discussion resulting, we believe in at least a more thorough understanding of different perspectives by everyone involved.\nThere were also several brief presentations and extensive discussion on different approaches for addressing the long-standing C++ and Java (among others) out-of-thin-air problem. Current semantics for these languages allow outcomes that are universally accepted as absurd, but which we do not know how to prohibit in any precise way. It is clear that none of the solutions are quite ready to be adopted, but there are encouraging results along several different paths. There is a consensus that this problem makes formal reasoning about programs nearly impossible and that it is a serious obstruction for tool development. There was less consensus about the extent to which it obstructs day-to-day programming efforts.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, the seminar inspired discussions and proposed challenging problems to tackle for the research community. As the discussions showed, designing sound and performant parallel systems require the cooperation of researchers on hardware and software level, with both theoretical and practical analyses and evaluations.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Annette Bieniusa, Hans-J.

            "title": "Ethics and Trust: Principles, Verification and Validation",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAcademics, engineers, and the public at large, are all wary of <em>autonomous systems</em>, particularly robots, drones, \"driver-less\" cars, etc. Robots will share our physical space, and so how will this change us? With the predictions of roboticists in hand, we can paint portraits of how these technical advances will lead to new experiences and how these experiences may change the ways we function in society. Two key issues are dominant once robot technologies have advanced further and yielded new ways in which we and robots share the world: (1) will robots behave <em>ethically</em>, i.e. as we would want them to, and (2) can we <em>trust</em> them to act to our benefit. It is more these barriers concerning ethics and trust than any engineering issues that are holding back the widespread development and use of autonomous systems. One of the hardest challenges in robotics is to  reliably determine desirable and undesirable behaviours for robots. We are currently undergoing another technology-led transformation in our society driven by the outsourcing of decisions to intelligent, and increasingly autonomous, systems. These systems may be software or embodied units that share our environment. The decisions they make have a direct impact on our lives. With this power to make decisions comes the responsibility for the impact of these decisions - legal, ethical and personal. But how can we  ensure that these artificial decision-makers can be <em>trusted</em> to make safe and <em>ethical</em> decisions, especially as the responsibility placed on them increases?\n</p> \n <p>\nThe related previous Dagstuhl Seminar 16222 on <em>Engineering Moral agents: From human morality to artificial morality</em> in 2016, highlighted further important areas to be explored, specifically:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>the extension of 'ethics' to also address issues of 'trust';\n</li><li> the practical problems of implementing ethical and trustworthy autonomous machines; \n</li><li> the new verification and validation techniques that will be required to assess these dimensions.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Thus, we thought that the area would benefit from a follow-up seminar which broadens up the scope to Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)  and (social) robotics research.\n</p> \n <p>We conducted a four-day seminar (1 day shorter than usual due to Easter) with 35 participants with diverse academic backgrounds including AI, philosophy, social epistemology, Human-Robot Interaction, (social) robotics, logic, linguistics, political science, and computer science. The first day of the seminar was dedicated to seven invited 20-minute talks which served as tutorials. Given the highly  interdisciplinary nature of the seminar, the participants from one discipline needed to be quickly brought up to speed with the state of the art in the discipline not their own. Moreover, the goal of these tutorials was to help develop a common language among researchers in the seminar. After these tutorials we gave all participants the chance to introduce their seminar-related research in 5-minute contributed talks. These talks served as a concise way to present oneself and introduce topics for discussion. \n</p> \n <p>\nBased on these inputs four topics were derived and further explored in working groups through the rest of the seminar: (1) Change of trust, including challenges and methods to foster and repair trust; (2) Towards artificial moral agency; (3) How do we build practical systems involving ethics and trust? (2 sub-groups) (4) The broader context of trust in HRI: Discrepancy between expectations and capabilities of autonomous machines. This report summarizes some of the highlights of those discussions and includes abstracts of the tutorials and some of the contributed talks. Ethical and trustworthy autonomous systems are a topic that will continue to be important in the coming years. We consider it essential to continue these cross-disciplinary efforts, above all as the seminar revealed that the \"interactional perspective\" of the \"human-in-the-loop\" is so far underrepresented in the discussions and that also broadening the scope to STS (Science and Technology Studies) and sociology of technology scholars would be relevant.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Astrid Weiss, Michael Fisher, Marija Slavkovik, and Christian List\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\n\nDagstuhl Seminar 19241 marked the 25th anniversary of the publication of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), which has had a huge impact on the fields of data compression, combinatorics on words, compact data structures, and bioinformatics.  The 10th anniversary in 2004 was marked by a workshop at the DIMACS Center at Rutgers (<a href=\"http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/BWT\">http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/BWT </a>) organized by Paolo Ferragina, Giovanni and S. Muthukrishnan, and it is exciting to see how far we have come.  In the past 15 years, interest in the BWT has shifted from data compression to compact data structures and bioinformatics, particularly indexing for DNA read alignment, but seven of the 33 participants of that workshop (including Giovanni) also attended this seminar.  Unfortunately, Professor G{o}rtz fell ill at the last minute and emailed us on June 11th to say she couldn't attend, but everyone else on the final list of invitees was present for at least some of the seminar (although not everyone made it into the photo).  In total there were 45 people (listed at the end of this report) from 13 countries, including ten women, six junior researchers and two researchers from industry.  By happy coincidence, the seminar started the day after Gonzalo's 50th birthday, so we were able to celebrate that as well.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Shape-Changing Interfaces Dagstuhl seminar aimed to bring together researchers from the disciplines of Computer Science, Design, Engineering, Robotics and Material Science to strenghten this new communinity, discuss grand challenges, form a research agenda, and to create opportunities for active collaborations. \n</p> \n <p>\nShape-changing interfaces use changes in physical geometry to convey input and output and are emerging as an alternative interaction method for communicating with computers. Discussions at the seminar were based around three key themes: (1) The technologies involved in shape-change, including soft and modular robotics, smart materials, and mechanical actuation. (2) The design of shape-changing interfaces, including their key application areas, and their industrial and interaction design. (3) The user experience of shape-changing interfaces, including evaluations of such interfaces and psycho-physical evaluation results. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo encourage active discussion, the seminar had no keynote speakers, but instead used brainstorming activities and small working-groups to understand challenges, explore the literature, and plan an agenda. Specifically, the following sessions were run:\n</p> \n <p>\n[Benefits and Applications of Shape-Change:] A whole-group brainstorming session developed categories of benefits and potential application areas for shape-changing interfaces.\n</p> \n <p>\n[Related Work:] Small working-groups focused on one of five related-work areas (materials, hardware, experience and interaction, design, or applications), researched, and then presented summaries of the five ground-breaking and five most over-looked works in that sub-field.\n</p> \n <p>\n[Grand Challenges:] A whole-group brainstorming session generated ideas and themes of grand challenges, small working groups then took a theme and dug deeper into the challenge, generating avenues of work and research agendas.\n</p> \n <p>\n[Worst Case Scenarios:] To understand why this field could fail, a brainstorming exercise asked participants to develop a series of `failure' situations---these were used as a method of creating awareness of the reasons progress in this field could stall. \n</p> \n <p>\n[Personal Reflections:] To conclude the seminar, four participants were asked to provide their personal reflections on the experience, and their key take-home messages. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was attended by 25 researchers from around the world; all of who found the experience invaluable. This report outlines the key findings of these sessions.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jason Alexander, Sean Follmer, Kasper Hornbaek, and Anne Roudaut\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Topological Methods in Distributed Computing",
            "data": "\n <p>This seminar brought together 22 researchers in combinatorial\ntopology and in theoretical distributed computing. Participants came\nfrom Germany, France, Israel, Switzerland, United States, Canada,\nJapan and Austria. The seminar featured a~combination of 1-hour\ntalks, group sessions and an open problems session.\n</p> \n <h3>Scientific background and topics of the seminar</h3> \n <p>In the classical sequential computational model, computability is\nviewed through the Church-Turing thesis, where computations are\nreduced to those done by Turing machines, and complexity issues are of\ncentral importance.  In the distributed setting, the situation is\nquite different. Since the threads of executions may intertwine in\nvarious ways (depending on the model), one of the central issues\nbecomes dealing with execution ambiguity, and deciding whether certain\nstandard tasks (Consensus, Renaming, etc.) are computable at all.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this sense, the distributed setting is harder to analyze rigorously\nthan the sequential one, or at least the difficulties are of quite\ndifferent type. At the same time very many real-life situations need\nto be modeled by the distributed setting. These include networks of\nbanking machines, or networks of flight controllers and airplanes, who\nneed to reach a common decision in a decentralized setting. Another\nexample is the parallel chip design, where we need to understand what\ntype of elementary operations - so-called computational primitives,\nhave to be implemented on the hardware level, so that the resulting\ncomputational system is powerful enough for our needs.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the 80s it was realized (due in particular to the work of Fischer,\nLynch and Paterson) that certain standard tasks (Consensus) cannot be solved in standard computational models (such as Message-Passing) in the presence of even simple processor crash failures.  As spectacular as it is, it has become one of the steps in  the development of a sophisticated and beautiful subject of theoretical\ndistributed computing; we refer here to the classical books of Lynch and Attiya &amp; Welch.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the late 90s and in the early years of our millenium, it was realized by at least 3 independent groups of researchers that topological methods are applicable in proving impossibility results in theoretical distributed computing. There\nfollowed a process of further penetration of topological methods, which by now have gained a definite foothold in distributed  computing. Additionally, there has also been some work on mathematical foundations, though much remains to be done when it comes to precise definitions and rigorous proofs. Independently, we feel that it is of great interest to develop the mathematics which is inspired by these\nmethods.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe state-of-the-art of the subject was recently summarized in a book\nby Herlihy, Kozlov and Rajsbaum. One of the paradigms introduced there is to replace the computational task specification by the triple: input complex, output complex, and task specification map, there the input and the output complexes are\nsimplicial complexes with additional structure, and the task specification map is what we call a carrier map, whose definition reflects our desire to restrict ourselves to the wait-free protocols. All the wait-free tasks can be encoded this way, and as a result one obtains both well-known as well as new structures from\ncombinatorial topology.\n</p> \n <p>Furthermore, one can consider the simplicial model for the totality of\nall executions of a given protocol -- the so-called protocol complex.\nIn the full formal setting one actually considers a triple of two\nsimplicial complexes and a carrier map, each one equipped with an\nadditional structure. The intuition here is that the second simplicial\ncomplex, as well as the carrier map depend heavily on the model of\ncomputation that we choose.  One standard example is to take the\nso-called Immediate Snapshot model. On Figure 1 we show the protocol complex for the one-round execution of the standard immediate snapshot protocol for 3 processors. As already this example shows, frequently there is a purely combinatorial description of the arising simplicial structure. The question of wait-free computability of a given task in a given computational model reduces\nthen to the question of existence of a~simplicial map from the protocol complex to the output complex, the so-called decision map, which satisfies certain conditions, which in essence mean that the outputs obtained by the protocol are valid under the task specification. Furthermore, we also have mathematical models for\nanonymous tasks, and anonymous protocols, as well as for colorless\ntasks.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs one can see, the mathematics needed for the current model is essentially that of simplicial complexes and carrier maps between them. With subsequent deepening of the theory and diversification of the considered questions, many further mathematical fields are coming in: for example, one needs to consider group actions and equivariant maps, as well as simplicial and carrier maps which satisfy other, less standard conditions. Many of the questions which arise in this setup\nare somewhat different from the questions classically studied in the\nsimplicial context.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Dmitry Feichtner-Kozlov and Damien Imbs\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming",
            "data": "\n <p>\nInductive programming (IP) addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer programs from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation traces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [5]. The generated - typically declarative - program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction. That is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In contrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary. Furthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is, they are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible [17, 8, 18]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [20, 14, 2]. In cases where synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive reasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such as test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [16].\n</p> \n <p>\nInductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the late sixties [1]. On the one hand, the complex\nintellectual cognitive processes involved in producing program code\nwhich satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand\nmethodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program\ndevelopment process are explored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques is end-user programming [3, 12, 4]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill synthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [8, 7, 6]. Related applications are in process mining and in data wrangling [11]. Inductive programming in general offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [15, 13] and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [10, 17]. Furthermore, inductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [19, 21]. \n</p> \n <h3>Recent Trends and Applications</h3> \n <p>When the first Dagstuhl Seminar on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming took place in 2013, the following trends could be identified: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Combining different approaches to inductive programming to leverage\ttheir complementary strengths.\n</li><li> New inductive programming approaches based on adapting and using well-developed techniques such as SAT-solving.\n</li><li> Putting inductive programming to application, for example in the areas of automated string manipulations in spreadsheets or web \tprogramming.\n</li><li> Applying concepts of inductive programming to cognitive models of learning structural concepts.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe main outcomes of the second seminar were (1) a joint publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal with respect to the evaluation of computational models solving intelligence test problems \u2013 among them inductive programming systems [9], (2) a joint publication addressing comprehensibility as a second criterium to evaluate machine learning approaches besides accuracy [18], and (3) a NIPS\u20192016 workshop on Neural Nets and Program Induction.\n</p> \n <p>\nBased on the results of the second seminar, the focus of\nthe third seminar has been on the following aspects:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning.\n</li><li> Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems.\n</li><li>Discussing current applications of inductive programming in enduser programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application.\n</li><li> Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn the seminar, we brought together researchers from different areas of computer science - especially from machine learning, AI, declarative programming, and software engineering - and researchers from cognitive psychology interested in inductive learning as well as in teaching and learning computer programming. Furthermore, participants from industry\npresented current as well as visionary applications for inductive programming.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was opened with lecture style talks introducing the four major approaches of inductive programming: Inductive functional programming, inductive logic programming, inductive probabilistic logical programming, and programming by example. \n</p> \n <p>\nTalks covered current developments of IP algorithms, challenging applications -especially in data wrangling and in education -, and   relations of IP to cognition.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition, several system demons and tutorials were given: Igor and EasyIgor (by Sebastian Seufert and Ute Schmid), MagicHaskeller (by Susumu Katayama), Sketch (by Armando Solar-Lezama), PROSE (by Oleksandr Polozov), Slipcover (by Fabrizio Riguzzi), and TaCLe (by Luc De Raedt).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following topics were identified and further discussed in\nworking groups during the seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How to determine relevancy of background knowledge to reduce search?\n</li><li> Integrating IP with other types of machine learning, especially Deep Learning?\n</li><li> Data wrangling as exiting area of application.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Additional topics identified as relevant have been \nanomaly detection, noise, robustnes, as well as non-example based interaction (e.g., natural language).\n</p> \n <h3>Concluding remarks and future plans</h3> \n <p>\nIn the wrapping-up section, we collected answers to the question<br/>\n\u201cWhat would constitute progress at Dagstuhl 2019?\u201d <br/>\n</p> \n <p>\nThe most prominent answers were\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>make available systems, data sets (via IP webpage)\n</li><li> compare systems\n</li><li> common vocabulary, work on applications attempted by others: drawing problems, string transformation, general ai challenge, benchmarks starexec, learn robot strategy, grammar learning \twhat is inductive programming\n</li><li> open problems\n</li></ul> \n <p>As the grand IP challenge we came up with: <b>An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an integer factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!</b>\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>A.

            "data": "\n <p>\nStorage systems, including databases and file systems, are at the heart of all large data applications. Recently, some storage systems have incorporated theoretical advances in data organization techniques, with substantial improvements in performance. However, there is little contact between the systems designers who build storage systems and theoreticians who design new ways to organize data. This Seminar worked to bridge this gap, to the benefit of both communities and to improve the design of all storage systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nExternal-memory algorithms are those where the data is too large to fit in memory, and hence needs to be stored on disk and accessed using I/O. Algorithmic analysis of such algorithms therefore focuses on the number of I/Os needed to complete a computation, rather than the number of instructions. This is because an I/O can be many orders of magnitude slower than a machine instruction and therefore I/Os can be the bottleneck in such computations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe theoretical analysis of such external-memory algorithms has produced many exciting results in the last two decades. Many of these are directly relevant to practical applications, but only a few have made the leap to deployment. This Seminar brought together theoreticians, who have an extensive understanding of the state of the art in external-memory data structures, and storage systems researchers and practitioners, who understand the details of the problems that need to be solved.\n</p> \n <p>\nSpecific questions that were addressed in the workshop include the following: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> How can we use the huge improvements in string data structures to improve storage systems that manipulate strings? Many data structures, such as LSMs and B^varepsilon-trees, rely heavily on the assumption that keys are indivisible and small.\n</li><li> How can we use new multi-dimensional data indexes in working systems?\n</li><li> Many indexes suffer from fragmentation. Are there data structure improvements that would allow efficient storage on disks that are nearly full? Currently, disks are kept only a fraction full because the performance of existing data structures decays dramatically as the disk fills. This suggests another problem:\n</li><li> How can theoretical models be improved to capture such issues as:\n<ul>\n<li>full disk: The external memory model, the disk is of unbounded size.\n</li><li> sequential access: Both hard disks and SSDs require very large blocks of sequential I/O to capture a large fraction of bandwidth. The external-memory model assumes that disks are random access.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li>Concurrency: Can data structures be designed to exploit memory locality on disk while maintaining concurrency in RAM?\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michael Bender, Martin Farach-Colton, Inge Li G\u00f8rtz, Rob Johnson, and Donald E.

            "title": "User-Generated Content in Social Media",
            "data": "\n <p>Social media play a central role in many people's lives, and they also have a profound impact on businesses and society. Users post vast amounts of content (text, photos, audio, video) every minute. This user generated content (UGC) has become increasingly multimedia in nature. It documents users' lives, revealing in real time their interests and concerns and activities in society. The analysis of UGC can offer insights to individual and societal concerns and could be beneficial to a wide range of applications, for example, tracking mobility in cities, identifying citizen's issues, opinion mining, and much more. In contrast to classical media, social media thrive by allowing anyone to publish content with few constraints and no oversight. Social media posts thus show great variation in length, content, quality, language, speech and other aspects. This heterogeneity poses new challenges for standard content access and analysis methods. On the other hand, UGC is often related to other public information (e.g. product reviews or discussion of news articles), and there often is rich contextual information linking, which allows for new types of analyses.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this seminar, we aimed at discussing the specific properties of UGC, the general research tasks currently operating on this type of content, identifying their limitations and lacunae, and imagining new types of applications made possible by the availability of vast amounts of UGC. This type of content has specific properties such as presentation quality and style, bias and subjectivity of content, credibility of sources, contradictory statements, and heterogeneity of language and media. Current applications exploiting UGC include sentiment analysis, noise removal, indexing and retrieving UGC, recommendation and selection methods, summarization methods, credibility and reliability estimation, topic detection and tracking, topic development analysis and prediction, community detection, modeling of content and user interest trends, collaborative content creation, cross media and cross lingual analysis, multi-source and multi-task analysis, social media sites, live and real-time analysis of streaming data, and machine learning for big data analytics of UGC. These applications and methods involve contributions from several data analysis and machine learning research directions. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought together researchers from different subfields of computer science, such as information retrieval, multimedia, natural language processing, machine learning and social media analytics. After participants gave presentations of their current research orientations concerning UGC, we decided to split into two Working Groups: (WG-1) Fake News and Credibility, and (WG-2) Summarizing and Storytelling from UGC. \n</p> \n <h3>WG-1: Fake News and Credibility</h3> \n <p>WG-1 began discussing the concept of Fake News, and we arrived at the conclusion that it was a topic with much nuance, and that a hard and fast definition of what was fake and what was real news would be hard to define. We then concentrated on deciding what elements of Fake (or Real) News could be calculated or quantified by computer. This led us to construct a list of text quality measures that have or are being studied in the Natural Language Processing community: Factuality, Reading Level, Virality, Emotion, Opinion, Controversy, Authority, Technicality, and Topicality. During this discussion, WG-1 invented and mocked up what we called an Information Nutrition Label, modeled after nutritional labels found on most food products nowadays. We feel that it would be possible to produce some indication of the \"objective\" value of a text using the above nine measures. The user could use these measures to judge for themselves whether a given text was \"fake\" or \"real\". For example, a text highly charged in Emotion, Opinion, Controversy, and Topicality might be Fake News for a given reader. Just like with a food nutritional label, a reader might use the Information Nutritional Label to judge whether a given news story was \"healthy\" or not.\n</p> \n <p>\nWG-1 split into further subgroups to explore whether current status of research in the nine areas: Factuality, Reading Level, etc. For each topic, the subgroups sketched out the NLP task involved, found current packages, testbeds and datasets for the task, and provided recent bibliography for the topic. Re-uniting in one larger group, each subgroup reported on their findings, and we discussed next steps, envisaging the following options: a patent covering the idea, creating a startup that would implement all nine measures and produce a time-sensitive Information Nutritional Label for any text submitted to it, a hackathon that would ask programmers to create packages for any or all of the measurements, a further workshop around the Information Nutrition label, integration of the INL into teaching of Journalists, producing a joint article describing the idea. We opted for the final idea, and we produced a submission (also attached to this report) for the Winter issue of the SIGIR (Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval) Forum.\n</p> \n <h3>WG-2: Summarizing and Storytelling from UGC</h3> \n <p>\nWG-2 set out to re-examine the topic of summarization. Although this is an old topic, but in the era of user-generated content with accelerated rates of information creation and dissemination, there is a strong need to re-examine this topic from the new perspectives of timeliness, huge volume, multiple sources and multimodality. The temporal nature of this problem also brings it to the realm of storytelling, which is done separately from that of summarization. We thus need to move away from the traditional single source document-based summarization, by integrating summarization and storytelling, and refocusing the problem space to meet the new challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe first split the group into two sub-groups, to discuss separately: (a) the motivations and scopes, and (b) the framework of summarization. The first sub-group discussed the sources of information for summarization including, the user-generated content, various authoritative information sources such as the news and Wikipedia, the sensor data, open data and proprietary data. The data is multilingual and multimodal, and often in real time. The group then discussed storytelling as a form of dynamic summarization. The second group examined the framework for summarization. It identified the key pipeline processes comprising of: data ingestion, extraction, reification, knowledge representation, followed by story generation. In particular, the group discussed the roles of time and location in data, knowledge and story representation.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, the group identified key challenges and applications of the summarization framework. The key challenges include multi-source data fusion, multilinguality and multimodality, the handling of time/ temporality/ history, data quality assessment and explainability, knowledge update and renewal, as well as focused story/ summary generation. The applications that can be used to focus the research includes event detection, business intelligence, entertainments and wellness. The discussions have been summarized into a paper entitled \"Rethinking Summarization and Storytelling for Modern Social Multimedia\". The paper is attached along with this report. It has been submitted to a conference for publication.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                     Norbert Fuhr, Tat-Seng Chua, Gregory Grefenstette, Kalervo J\u00e4rvelin, and Jaakko Peltonen\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nProof systems are software systems that allow us to build formal proofs, either\ninteractively or automatically, and to check the correctness of such proofs. Building such a formal proof is always a difficult task -- for instance the Feit-Thompson odd order theorem, the CompCert verified C compiler, the seL4 verified operating system micro-kernel, and the proof of the Kepler conjecture required several years with a medium to large team of developers to be completed. Moreover, the fact that each  of these proofs is formalized in a specific logic and the language of a specific proof tool is a severe limitation to its dissemination within the community of mathematicians and computer\nscientists. Compared to many other branches of computer science, for\ninstance software engineering, we are still very far from having off-the-shelf and ready-to-use components, \"proving in the large\" techniques, and interoperability of theory and systems. However, several teams around the world are working on this issue and partial solutions have been proposed including point-to-point translations, proof standards, and logical frameworks. Yet, a lot still remains to be done as there is currently no overarching general foundation and methodology.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar has been organized to bring together researchers from\ndifferent communities, such as automated proving, interactive proving and SAT/SMT solving as well as from logic, proof engineering, program verification and formal mathematics. An essential goal has been to form a community around these issues in order to learn about and reconcile these different approaches. This will allow us to develop a common objective and framework for proof developments that support the communication, reuse, and interoperability of proofs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe program of the seminar included introductions to different methods\nand techniques, the definition of precise objectives, and the description of recent achievements and current trends.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 17431 \"Performance Portability in Extreme Scale Computing: Metrics, Challenges, Solutions\".\n</p> \n <p>\nPerformance Portability is a critical new challenge in extreme-scale computing. In essence, performance-portable applications can be efficiently executed on a wide variety of HPC architectures without significant manual modifications. For nearly two decades, HPC architectures and programming models remained relatively stable, which allowed growth of complex multidisciplinary applications whose lifecycles span multiple generations of HPC platforms.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecently, however, platforms are growing much more complex, diverse, and heterogeneous - both within a single system and across systems and generations. Details already known from planned future systems indicate that this trend will continue (at least for the foreseeable future). Current and planned future large-scale HPC systems consist of complex configurations with a massive number of components. Each node has multiple multi-core sockets and often one or more additional accelerator units in the form of many-core nodes or GPGPUs, resulting in a heterogeneous system architecture. Memory hierarchies including caches, memory, and storage are also diversifying in order to meet multiple constraints: power, latency, bandwidth, persistence, reliability, and capacity. These factors are reducing portability, and forcing applications teams to either spend considerable effort porting and optimizing their applications for each specific platform, or risk owning applications that perform well on perhaps only one architecture. The latter option would still require porting and optimizing effort for each new generation of systems. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar represented a unique opportunity to bring together international experts from the three research communities essential to tackling this performance portability challenge: developers of large-scale computational science software projects whose lifetime will span multiple generations of systems, researchers developing relevant parallel programming or system software technologies, and specialists in profiling, understanding, and modelling performance. The major research questions for the seminar were:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>To understand challenges, design metrics, and prioritize potential solutions for performance portability: Solutions will need to synthesize existing concepts across multiple fields, including performance and productivity modeling, programming models and compilation, architectures, system software.\n</li><li> Management of data movement in complex applications: Diverse data movement patterns dictated by different devices form one of the largest impediments to portable performance. Addressing it will require cross-cutting solutions supporting more than one abstraction, and will allow scientists to balance tradeoffs in these factors prior to design, development, or procurement of an architecture, software stack, or application.\n</li><li> Composability: Many applications require flexibility and composability because they address different physical regimes either within the same simulation, or in different instances of simulations.\n</li><li> Pathways to impact on the research community: As the community becomes more reliant on both more complex architectures and software stacks, it is especially important that we develop the conceptual tools to facilitate research and practical solutions for performance portability. The impact of ignoring this topic could be potentially devastating to the quality and sustainability of computational science software, and consequently on the science and engineering research they support. Thus a key element of the seminar will be to tackle this challenge in major science community software projects.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with a series of flash talks, where participants introduced themselves in a two-minute one-slide presentation summarizing their contribution or interest in the seminar by providing two to three bullet points on (i) Challenge/Opportunity (WHY?) (ii) Timeliness (WHY NOW?) (iii) Approaches (HOW?) and (iv) IMPACT (SO WHAT?).\nEach day started with a longer keynote presentation by a representative of one of the major stakeholders in the field, followed by short presentations by  participants grouped in sessions with a common relevant theme. Each keynote or short talk session ended with an extensive question-and-answer session and open discussion slot in which all the speakers from the session took part.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe overall conclusion shared by all participants was that performance portability in extreme scale computing can be achieved, especially if parallel applications are designed with performance portability in mind from the beginning.\nModel complexity and performance portability both require that frameworks be designed with composable components incorporating layers of abstraction so that trade-offs can be reasoned about. Making legacy application performance portable still requires enormous efforts and expertise. In many instances it will likely require extensive refactoring. Similar design principles regarding formulation of a flexible and composable framework apply for legacy software refactoring, along with strong emphasis on rigorous verification built into the process. The seminar recognized the challenges faced by the applications in adopting abstractions; converting research prototypes to reliable production-grade product. The adverse structure of incentives for both applications and abstractions, and the complexity of formulating a process or collaboration between the two communities, may be bigger barriers than technical challenges in making performance portability feasible. It is critical that the involved communities and stakeholders are made aware of these challenges while seeking solutions for sustainable computational science projects.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anshu Dubey, Paul H.

            "data": "\n <p>Mass spectrometry is the predominant analytical technique for detection, identification, and quantification in metabolomics experiments. Technological advances in mass spectrometry and experimental workflows during the last decade enabled novel investigations of biological systems on the metabolite level. Metabolomics started as the study of all metabolites in a living cell or organism; in comparison to transcriptome and proteome, the metabolome is\na better proxy of metabolic activity. Emerging fields including personalized medicine and exposomics have expanded the scope of metabolomics to \u201call\u201d small molecules, including those of non-biological origin. Advances in instrumentation plus rapid increase in popularity, throughput and desired compound coverage has resulted in vast amounts of both raw and processed data; the field is in desperate need for further developments in computational\nmethods. Methods established in other -omics fields are frequently not transferable to metabolomics due to the structural diversity of small molecules. This third Dagstuhl Seminar on Computational Metabolomics (following Seminars 15492 and 17491) focused on cheminformatics and machine learning. The seminar was less structured than previous seminars, forming break-out sessions already from Monday afternoon, then collecting participants back into plenary sessions at regular intervals for discussions and further topic exploration. The major topics launched on Monday included cheminformatics, genome mining and autoencoders, which were developed throughout the day. Other topics discussed throughout the week included biosynthesis and gene clusters, confidence and compound identification, spectral versus structural similarity, statistical integration, collision cross section (CCS) and ion mobility separation (IMS), benchmarking data, open feature file format, exposomics, data processing and acquisition. Several evening sessions were also held, including retention time,\nBioschemas, MassBank, ethics and philosophy of software development, open biological pathways, mass spec health check, Jupyter notebooks, a mini decoy session and a session on coding tips. The excursion, breaking with previous Christmas Market traditions, was to the V\u00f6lklingen steelworks. Finally, the entire seminar was wrapped up with a discussion on the future of untargeted metabolomics on Friday \u2013 time will tell what the future Computational\nMetabolomics Seminars will bring. A further seminar in the series may be considered for the end of 2021 or in 2022.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sebastian B\u00f6cker, Corey Broeckling, Emma Schymanski, and Nicola Zamboni\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 16321 <em>Coding Theory in the Time of Big Data</em>, held in August 7-12, 2016, was the third of a series of Dagstuhl seminars relating modern aspects of coding theory and its applications in computer science. The overarching technical theme was on how fundamentals of coding theory could be applied to data storage and transmission in the context of big data and conversely, on emerging topics in coding theory arising from such applications.\nIn Dagstuhl Seminar 11461 the main topics discussed were list decoding, codes on graphs, network coding and the relations between them. The themes of distributed storage, network coding and polar codes were central to Dagstuhl Seminar 13351. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe conference was organised into six main working groups, as listed below:  \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> Distributed Storage &amp; Index Coding,\n</li><li> Private Information Retrieval for Storage Codes,\n</li><li> DNA-Based Storage,\n</li><li> Age &amp; Delay of Information.\n</li><li> Code-Based Cryptography,\n</li><li> Rank-Metric Codes.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThe amount of data that is being stored is scaling at a rapid pace making efficient data storage an important problem that inspires several lines of scientific research. During the seminar, several discussions were conducted on the theme of using classical and new techniques from coding theory to store/compute data efficiently in distributed storage systems. A number of open problems were identified, such as the design of codes with optimal repair bandwidth, fundamental trade-offs between storage &amp; communication cost, applications to content distribution networks, connections between fundamental limits of storage/caching and the index coding problem and applications of coding theory for parallel computing. A theoretical framework and numerical simulation for the long term reliability of a distributed storage system were presented by Luby. \n</p> \n <p>DNA-based storage was recently proposed to address new challenges to handle extremely high volume recording media to propose new compression methods for non-traditional data formats. Since DNA may be easily replicated and a massive amount of information stored reliably with minimal space requirements, it has enormous potential as a method of big data storage. This was the focus of the DNA working group. Problems such read and write cost, insertion and deletion errors arising in sequences, error reduction were discussed. Milenkovic gave an introductory talk describing several problems associated with whole genome, sequencing read, RNA-seq and ChiP-seq data compression, and outlined the first portable DNA-based rewritable and random access storage system. \n</p> \n <p> \n  Private information retrieval (PIR) enables a user to retrieve a data item from a database without disclosing the identity of the item retrieved, while the data itself may be public. The PIR working group considered this problem in the context of storage codes, in particular for dynamic coded storage and adversarial PIR, with some extensions to asynchronized systems, batch codes and private keyword search. Hollanti gave a tutorial overview of recent results in the area. \n</p> \n <p>  Age of information is a metric for status updating systems, where a monitor is interested in staying timely about the status of a source. The optimal updating strategy that minimizes the average age exists when the updating rate is constrained by limited network resources. Streaming source coding problems can be applied to the problem of age analysis. The main focus the Age &amp; Delay working group was to introduce the age of information concept to participating coding theorists and explore potential age and delay problems in coding and storage. An adaptive arithmetic coding scheme was proposed as a potential solution to avoid huge decoding delay. Several possible delay problems in file downloading from multiple servers were discussed. Two PhD students, Zhong and Najm  gave a tutorial overview of the topic.\n</p> \n <p>Code-based crypto-systems are some of the very few that resist quantum-based attacks. In the case subfield subcodes such as the Goppa or Srivastava codes no successful attack is known yet. Moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes have been proposed for key size reduction in such crytposystems. The group identified open problems such as investigating other subfield subcodes and attacks on MDPC structured codes. An overview was presented by Bossert.\n</p> \n <p> Rank-metric codes have applications in random network coding, coded-caching and in code-based cryptography. The working group focussed on maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, specifically their classifications and on algebraic methods for constructing and decoding families of them. New nontrivial classifications were obtained. Further research directions on the classification problem were identified such as adapting semi-field theory techniques and searches for codes with high symmetry. Given the known limitation of list decoders for Gabidulin codes, the group worked on adapting decoders for Gabidulin codes to recent families of MRD codes. Sheekey presented recent results on MRD codes and described links to semifields. \n </p> \n <p>\n   A total of 44 researchers participated in the seminar across these working groups. In addition, several participants took the opportunity to collaborate with others on specific related projects. There were 16 talks in total, several related to storage of big data and others on topics such as maximum rank distance codes, chip-to-chip communication, the MDS conjecture, the SAGE computer algebra system, age of information, the edge removal problem, convolutional codes and network coding. Among the talks given were some tutorial presentations, aimed at introducing researchers to fundamentals of a related working group. The working groups focussed on identifying and addressing new and/or important open problems in the area. Age &amp; Delay, PIR for storage codes and DNA-based storage were new topics to many participants and generated considerable interest. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Bossert, Eimear Byrne, and Emina Soljanin\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Symmetric Cryptography",
            "data": "\n <p>IT Security plays a crucial role in everyday life and business.  Virtually all modern security solutions are based on cryptographic primitives.  <em>Symmetric</em> cryptography deals with the case that both the sender and the receiver of a message are using the same key and is highly relevant not only for academia, but also for industrial research and applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe identified the following areas as among the most important topics for future research.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Cryptography in the presence of strong constraints.</b> This area deals with the development of symmetric cryptographic primitives and modes that must operate under strong constraints.  The area, often indicated by the misleading term lightweight cryptography, has become a very active research field in recent years.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Proving relevant bounds for permutations and (tweakable) block ciphers.</b>  Security arguments for symmetric cryptographic primitives often rely on simplifying assumptions and unproven heuristics.  Moreover, not only are they often limited by those simplifications, but more fundamentally by the resulting statements.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Development of modes for dedicated functionality or robustness.</b> A cryptographic primitive, e.g., a cryptographic permutation or a (tweakable) block cipher, is of little use without being embedded in a suitable mode of operation.  Traditional modes turn such a primitive into an (authenticated) encryption scheme, a message authentication code or a hash function.  However, modes of operations could provide more advanced functionalities on the one hand and advanced security features on the other hand.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Quantum cryptanalysis.</b> The threat that one would be able to build a sufficiently large quantum computer has a major impact on the security of many cryptographic schemes we are using today.  In particular, the seminal work of Shor showed that such computers would allow to factor large integers and compute discrete logs over large groups in practical time.  In the case of symmetric cryptography, the situation seems less critical - but is also significantly less studied.  For almost 20 years, it was believed that the only advantage an attacker would have by using a quantum computer when attacking symmetric cryptography is due to Grover's algorithm for speeding up brute force search.  Only recently researchers have started to investigate in more detail how the security of symmetric primitives would be affected by attackers equipped with quantum computers.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar program consisted of short presentations and group meetings. Presentations were about the above topics and other relevant areas of symmetric cryptography, including state-of-the-art cryptanalytic techniques and new designs. Below one can find the list of abstracts for talks given during the seminar. Also, participants met in smaller groups and spent a significant portion of the week, each group intensively discussing a specific research\ntopic. There were eight research groups: 1) Design and analyze ciphers over prime fields, 2) Bounds on the degree of Feistel ciphers with round functions with low univariate degree, 3) Forkcipher, 4) Time-space tradeoffs, 5) Quantum cryptanalysis of hash functions, 6) NIST LWC, 7) Cryptanalysis of the Russian standards, and 8) Security of ProMACs. On the last day of the week the leaders of each group gave brief summaries of achievements. Some teams continued working on the topic after the seminar and started new research collaborations.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nils Gregor Leander, Bart Mennink, Kaisa Nyberg, and Kan Yasuda\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>The Dagstuhl Seminar 17372 \"Cybersafety in Modern Online Social Networks\" was a short two and a half day seminar, which took place September 10th-13th, 2017.\nIts main goal was to bring together researchers from various research areas related to cyberfraud and cybersafety in online social network, and to inspire them to exchange results, practical requirements, and ethical/legal implications related to user-driven research.\n</p> \n <p><b>First Day.</b> The seminar started with a short self-introduction of all the participants, then, we had an initial brainstorming session to identify main topics of interest, various aspects involved in them, and a balance in terms of interdisciplinary representation. \nSpecifically, we focused on scams happening in online social network and hate speech, while paying special attention to the protection of minors.\nThe aspects discussed were related to algorithmic, user, understanding/modeling, ethical, and privacy aspects of working in this line of research.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe brainstorming session concluded with the discussion of the following tangible research directions:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>We should work on detection, prevention, and mitigation of hate speech.\n</li><li> All solutions should be in accordance of regulations.\n</li><li> We should pay particular attention to false positives, as users can easily lose their trust in the platform.\n</li><li> We should take into consideration the role of proxies, which act as biases on the data.\n</li><li> We should focus on counter-terrorism research that aims to distinguish vulnerable population in order to recruit them for propaganda purposes.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nWe then had four long talks throughout the day.\nThe first speaker, Jeremy Blackburn (University of Alabama at Birmingham, US), described his work on cyberbullying and hate speech that includes studying behavior on video games as well as fringe Web communities like 4chan.\nThe second speaker, Filippo Menczer (Indiana University -- Bloomington, US) ,presented how misinformation is spread on Twitter.\nSpecifically, he presented how false information as well as the respective fact-checking efforts are diffused on the Twitter network.\nThe third speaker, Gianluca Stringhini (University College London, GB) presented his work on cyberfraud and scams, focusing on deceptive techniques employed by malicious users in order to scam benign users on online dating sites.\nThe last speaker of the first day was Awais Rashid (Lancaster University, GB), who described his work related to child sex offenders and how he coordinated with Police bodies in order to undertake research on this topic. Also, he presented the ethical considerations when doing research with sensitive data, like those used for this study.\n</p> \n <p><b>Second Day.</b>  The morning of the second day focused on giving an overview of work done on a variety of topics related to the main topics of the seminar (through short talks from the participants). \nMore specifically, Zinaida Benenson (Universit\u00e4t Erlangen - N\u00fcrnberg, DE), described her work on spear fishing, where malicious users aim to deceive users by sending email that contain malicious URLs.\nThen, Michael Sirivianos (Cyprus University of Technology - Lemesos, CY) presented his work on how to combat friend spam by analyzing the underlying network of social rejections. \nThe next talk was by Alexandra Olteanu (IBM TJ Watson Research Center - Yorktown Heights, US), who discussed some preliminary results on work done on hate speech. \nSrijan Kumar (Stanford University, US) then showed how sockpuppet accounts are used in social networks to change and manipulate the opinions of other users of the platform.\nSavvas Zannettou (Cyprus University of Technology - Lemesos, CY) presented his research on how news propagates across multiple Web communities, and how to measure their influence.\nThen, Manuel Egele (Boston University, US), presented COMPA, which is a system that captures the behavioral profile of the user in order to identity possible account compromises.\nHuy Kang Kim (Korea University - Seoul, KR) talked about malicious users exploiting video games to make money. \nNext, Oana Goga (MPI-SWS - Saarbrucken, DE) described how online identities can be strengthen by combining multiple weak identities. \nThe last talk was by Julien Freudiger (Apple Computer Inc. - Cupertino, US), who covered public privacy and safety guidelines used at Apple.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe afternoon was dedicated to two parallel working groups focused on discussions around a particular topic, specifically, one was about future directions on hate speech research, and another about ethical considerations that researchers should keep in mind when working with users or user data.\n</p> \n <p><b>Third Day.</b>  The final day of the seminar had two more parallel working groups, one on research directions related to cyberfraud in online social network, and another on algorithmic biases and possible solutions to avoid it.\nWe then had a discussion summarizing the work and the discussion done in the various working groups and ended up with ideas for future events, collaborations, and follow-ups.\n</p> \n <p><b>Acknowledgments.</b> The organizers of this workshop acknowledge research funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No 691025. \nThe organizers would like to thank the Schloss Dagstuhl for the professional, productive, and enjoyable atmosphere it provides and for their invaluable support.\nFinally, we are grateful to and Seda Guerses for taking notes during two of the working groups and to Savvas Zannettou for coordinating the writing of this report and taking notes throughout the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jeremy Blackburn, Emiliano De Cristofaro, Gianluca Stringhini, Michael Sirivianos, and Thorsten Strufe\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Algebraic Effect Handlers go Mainstream",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAlgebraic effects and their handlers have been steadily gaining attention as a programming language feature for composably expressing user-defined computational effects. Algebraic effect handlers generalise many control-flow abstractions such as exception handling, iterators, async/await, or backtracking, and in turn allow them to be expressed as libraries rather than implementing them as primitives as many language implementations do. While several prototype languages that incorporate effect handlers exist, they have not yet been adopted into mainstream languages. This Dagstuhl Seminar 18172 \"Algebraic Effect Handlers Go Mainstrea\" touched upon various topics that hinder adoption into mainstream languages. To this end, the participants in this seminar included a healthy mix of academics who study algebraic effects and handlers, and developers of mainstream languages such as Haskell, OCaml, Scala, WebAssembly, and Hack.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar follows the earlier, wildly successful Dagstuhl Seminar 16112 \"From Theory to Practice of Algebraic Effects and Handlers\" which was dedicated to addressing fundamental issues in the theory and practice of algebraic effect handlers. We adopted a similar structure for this seminar. We had talks each day in the morning, scheduled a few days ahead. The folks from the industry were invited to present their perspectives on some of the challenges that could potentially be address with the help of effect handlers. The afternoons were left free for working in self-organised groups and show-and-tell sessions with results from the previous days. We also had impromptu lectures on the origins of algebraic effects and handlers, which were quite well received and one of the highlights of the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nBetween the lectures and working-in-groups, the afternoons were rather full. Hence, a few participants offered after-dinner \"cheesy talks\" just after the cheese was served in the evening. The participants were treated to entertaining talks over delightful cheese and fine wine. We encourage the organisers to leave part of the day unplanned and go with what the participants feel like doing on that day. The serendipitous success are what makes Dagstuhl Seminars special.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe are delighted with the outcome of the seminar. There were interesting discussions around the problem of <em>encapsulation</em> and leaking of effects in certain higher order use cases, with several promising solutions discussed. It was identified that the problem of encapsulation and leaking effect names is analogous to the name binding in lambda calculus. Another group made significant progress in extending WebAssembly with support for effect handlers. The proposal builds on top of support for exceptions in WebAssembly. During the seminar week, the syntax extensions and operational semantics were worked out, with work begun on the reference implementation. During the seminar, Andrej Bauer pointed out that several prototype implementations that incorporate effect handlers exist, each with their own syntax and semantics. This makes it difficult to translate ideas across different research groups. Hence, Andrej proposed and initiated effects and handlers rosetta stone - a repository of examples demonstrating programming with effects and handlers in various programming languages. This repository is hosted on GitHub and has had several contributions during and after the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, the seminar inspired discussions and brought to light the challenges in incorporating effect handlers in mainstream languages. During the previous seminar (16112), the discussions were centered around whether it was even possible to incorporate effect handlers into mainstream languages. During this seminar, the discussions were mainly on the ergonomics of effect handlers in mainstream languages. This is a testament to the success of the Dagstuhl Seminars in fostering cutting edge research.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Sivaramakrishnan Krishnamoorthy Chandrasekaran, Daan Leijen, Matija Pretnar, and Tom Schrijvers\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nFinite and Algorithmic Model Theory research revolves around the study\nof the expressive power of various logics on finite and finitely presented\nstructures, and the connections between this and different\ncomputational models and mathematical formalisms.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe methods and tools of finite and algorithmic model theory (FAMT)\nhave played an active role in the development of several areas of\ncomputer science.   Finite or finitely representable structures are those that serve as inputs to computation, and the study of the expressive power of logical languages on such structures has led to fundamental insights in diverse areas, including database theory, computational complexity, random structures and combinatorics, verification, automata theory, proof complexity, and\nalgorithmic game theory.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the past four decades FAMT has established itself as a rich\nresearch field with a strong and evolving community of researchers\nwith a shared agenda. Much of the progress can be traced to\nthe regular meetings of the community: the last such meeting was at\nDagstuhl in 2017, and before that at Les Houches in 2012.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe principal goals of this seminar included:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>To identify fresh challenges in FAMT arising from some of the main application  areas as well as newly emerging ones.\n</li><li> To make connections between core research in FAMT and other subfields of theoretical computer science, such as the theory of combinatorial  and continuous optimization algorithms, and the theory of homomorphism counts and limit structures.\n</li><li> To transfer knowledge from emerging techniques in core FAMT back to the connected subfields and application areas.\n</li><li>  To strengthen the research community in FAMT, especially by integrating younger members into it.\n</li><li>  To provide continuity for what has been a successful model of regular seminars for building and consolidating the productive research community in FAMT.\n</li></ol> \n <p>One of the main goals of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to capitalize on the\nprogress and the potential impact of some of the latest developments\nin FAMT and related areas. Such developments include:\n</p> \n <ul type=\"a\">\n<li>The recently established connections between symmetric models of\nclassical computation and bounded-variable counting logics. The\nsymmetric counterparts of classical models of computations include\nthreshold circuits, linear and semidefinite programs, and algebraic\ncircuits. These new results have already been used to establish new\nupper and lower bounds for large families of algorithms by FAMT tools.</li>\n<li> The theories of homomorphism counts and limit structures in\ncombinatorics. A recent trend of work establishes that distinguishing\nthe structures by the number homomorphisms they admit from certain\nclasses of patterns, or to certain classes of patterns, is a fruitful\nalternative to distinguishing them by the logic formulas they satisfy.</li>\n<li>Enumeration and counting methods including their use in database\nquery processing, among others. One of the goals of this line of\nresearch is to understand and classify the logical queries for which\nit is possible to compute a compact representation of the output from\nwhich the query results can be obtained, efficiently, and on demand.</li>\n</ul> \n <h3>Organization and Activities</h3> \n <p>The organizers developed a schedule consisting of  a number of invited survey talks,   a  number of  talks  focused on regular contributions \nproposed by participants, and an open problem session.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar took place in person at Dagstuhl, with essentially all talks (except one) delivered by speakers attending Dagstuhl in person.\nThe timing of the seminar coincided with the height of the Covid Omicron wave in Germany and Europe.  This resulted in a number of late covid-related cancellations.   Some talks, including invited talks, had to be cancelled, and the total number of participants (24) was fewer than originally planned.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nDespite the many organizational challenges presented by the covid  surge\naround the time of the workshop,  the seminar was highly stimulating and surprisingly successful\nfor those who were able to attend, and achieved many of our goals.   (And thankfully\nthere were no cases of covid during the seminar among those who did attend in person.)\n</p> \n <p>\nThe final program included invited tutorial talks by Martin Grohe on\nhomomorphism counts (delivered online, to an in person audience at the workshop, due to a last minute cancellation \nfor Grohe caused by COVID), David Roberson I and II on quantum isomorphism\nand its connection to homomorphism counting.\nThese and other related talks at the seminar highlighted\nthe exciting ongoing work  aimed at delineating the power of homorphism\ncounting on various classes of graphs and structures, with surprising connections to other areas of mathematics.\n</p> \n <p>\n Another invited talk was by\nAlbert Atserias on symmetric computation and descriptive complexity\n(replacing a last minute cancellation), highlighted the exciting recent developments\nat the intersection of FAMT and combinatorial optimization. \nAnother invited talk on query\nenumeration also had to be cancelled due to COVID. \nThe full schedule\nincluding all the other talks of the Seminar can be found in the adjoined\ntable.\n</p> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4987/schedule.png\"><img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4988/schedule.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a> \n <p>\nOne of the traditions of the series of workshops on Finite and\nAlgorithmic Model Theory is to have a session in which some of the\nattendants present open problems and directions for further\nresearch. In this occasion, an hour of the afternoon of Thursday was\ndevoted to such a session. A couple of days earlier we made a public\ncall for presentations of open problems. Volunteers would write down\ntheir name on an easel pad. By Thursday, three volunteers came forward\nwho gave 10 minute presentations (aprox.) of their proposals.\n</p> \n <p>\nFirst, Erich Graedel presented an open problem on the topic of his\nearlier talk on Wednesday. Shortly put, the open problem asks to\ndevelop a proof theory for the emerging field of semiring semantics\nfor logic formulas. The motivation comes from its potential\napplications in database theory and game analysis. Second, Isolde\nAdler presented an open problem on a topic covered in an earlier talk\nby Torunczyk. In brief, the open problem asks to study the\nrelationships between the various notions of model-theoretic stability\nfor classes of hypergraphs and more general relational\nstructures. Third, Kousha Etessami gave a short talk on his recent\nwork on applications of Tarski's Fixed-Point Theorem to economic game\ntheory. In a nutshell, the question asks how much faster can one\ncompute an arbitrary fixed-point of a monotone operator on a grid\nlattice than it takes to compute the least or greatest fixed-point by\nthe standard iteration method. A detailed exposition of this open\nproblem and its motivations can be found in a later section of this\nreport. Finally, during his talk on Tuesday, Albert Atserias announced\nan open problem related to the optimal hardness of approximating the\nminimum vertex cover on graphs. Since it was presented earlier during\na talk, this open problem was not presented during the session. A\ndetailed description of this open problem appears also in a later\nsection of this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the organizers regard the seminar as a resounding success \ndespite the difficult circumstances, and judging\nby the very positive feedback from participants, they agreed.\nWe look forward to the next meeting of the FAMT community, \nhopefully within a few years, whether at Dagstuhl or elsewhere.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers are grateful to the Scientific Directorate of the\nCenter for its support of this workshop and the staff of Schloss\nDagstuhl for their organisation of our stay (including regular covid testing) and their hospitality,  despite the many \nchallenges posed by covid.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Albert Atserias, Christoph Berkholz, Kousha Etessami, and Joanna Ochremiak\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Values in Computing",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe purpose of Dagstuhl Seminar 1929 \u2018Values in Computing\u2019 was to bring together practitioners and researchers with expertise stretching beyond computer science, to include sociology, ethics, and philosophy to examine the complex relations between human values, computing technologies and society. In so doing, the seminar invited an inter-disciplinary community to share their challenges, illustrate their approaches through concrete case studies,\nand distil lessons learned into actionable guidelines for research and education with tangible implications for policies and industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was motivated by the growing urgency for computing research and industry to answer questions about the role that digital technology plays in society. The greater the scale and reach of digital technology systems, the greater their impact, both intended and unintended. Mainstream media, popular science, and the general public have only started grappling with the scale of these consequences. Many are calling institutions, professionals,\nand scientists to act [3]. Recent years have seen an increasing number of high-profile software scandals and malpractices in which individual privacy and democracy have been undermined (Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of Facebook data), the environmental impact of air pollutants disregarded (the Volkswagen\u2019s diesel emission scandal), and human lives lost (the Boeing 737 Max anti-stall software disasters). \n</p> \n <p>\nThese events are the constant reminders that human values are indeed \u201cthe facts of the future\u201d [1], as Feenberg argues. Values are not the opposite of facts, they become facts: the more weight we give to certain values (e.g. wealth, political influence, power), the bigger the \u2018blind spots\u2019 of the existing values become (e.g. environmental sustainability, equality and social justice). There is a pressing need then to understand how human values operate and\nto build on this understanding to consider how research and education might contribute to a more socially responsible computing industry. \n</p> \n <p>To this end, the seminar brought together disciplines with a long tradition of critical thinking and human-centred approaches to computing with those that, such as Software Engineering, have been traditionally considered, albeit increasingly controversially, as \u2018values neutral\u2019. The breadth and depth of the interdisciplinary debate, one of the key distinguishing features and strengths of this five-day seminar, was also, and intentionally so, one of its main\nchallenges. This was particularly evident when the need to unpack the multifaceted and often abstract notion of human values was met by the demand for the discussion to be of concrete relevance to computing education and practice. Within this context, one of the key objectives of the seminar was to facilitate both the exploration of broad themes and the identification of specific topics that would require meaningful cross-disciplinary effort. To\nthis end, a two-pronged approach was designed to encourage both divergence and converge of viewpoints.\n</p> \n <p>Thematic divergence was encouraged through six short <em>Seed Talks</em>, ten open-floor <em>Lightning Talks</em>, and a <em>Soap Box</em> session were participants would pitch high-level challenges to provoke discussion. Convergence was facilitated by <em>World Caf\u00e9</em> style group discussions around six emergent themes. Over the last two days, these themes were then distilled into four topics with one working group assigned to each (<em>Action, Education, Research</em>, and <em>Response</em>). Seed Talks were invited 20-minute talks designed to be informative and provocative. Thematically, they were structured around the original seminar proposal scoping areas: theory and methodologies (Feenberg and Mainzer), professional practice (Spiekermann and Whittle); and educational pathways (Nathan and Patitsas). Participants offered Lightning Talks on a variety of topics of their own choosing. For instance, Easterbrook focused on the environmental crisis and called for urgent action; Walker, McCord and Lievrouw shared their experiences of socially\nresponsible digital activism; Frauenberger provided concrete examples on how different ways of thinking informatics in education [2]; Winter outlined the tools and techniques used to study values in software production [4]; and Jensen-Ferreira shared her approach to software industry research. Finally, four teams worked on a specific Values in Computing topic, each\nidentifying a possible course of action:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><em>Action</em> \u2013 This group worked under the premise that the professional knowledge and critical insight of computer and social scientists should be mobilized as an active force in public education and policy-making concerning the design, implementation and regulation of information technology. With a view to these three lines of action, the group proposed\nthe penning and wide distribution of a document, tentatively entitled \u201cThe Dagstuhl Declaration\u201d here included.\n</li><li><em>Research</em> \u2013 The Research group pursued a threefold-goal: understand the state-of-the-art of the research and highlight under-explored research areas; discuss methods and tools\nthat have been or can be used, and identify future research directions.\n</li><li><em> Education</em> \u2013 The Education group discussed the implications for undergraduate and graduate computing education by conducting a brief but focused exploration of existing university-level courses, methods and tools and their mapping of curriculum cross-cutting learning objectives.\n</li><li><em>Response</em> \u2013 This group worked on the intersection between climate emergency and the future of computing and centred its activity on gathering resources about this intersection and writing an opinion piece to address it.\n</li></ol> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Andrew Feenberg.

            "title": "Algorithms and Complexity for Continuous Problems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis was already the 13th Dagstuhl Seminar on Algorithms and Complexity for Continuous Problems over a period of 28 years. It brought together researchers from different communities working on complexity of continuous problems. Such problems, which originate from numerous areas, including physics, chemistry, finance, and economics, can almost never be solved analytically, but rather only approximately to within some error threshold. The complexity analysis ideally includes the construction of (asymptotically) optimal algorithms. Although the seminar title has remained the same, many of the topics and participants change with each seminar and each seminar in this series is of a very interdisciplinary nature. The current seminar attracted 41 participants from nine different countries all over the world. About 30% of them were young researchers including PhD students. There were 34 presentations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following topics were covered: \n</p> \n <p><b>Tractability analysis of high-dimensional problems:</b> Tractability analysis is an area of applied mathematics and theoretical computer science that studies the minimal computational resources needed for the approximate solution of problems with a huge number of variables, and it can be seen as a unifying theme for the preceding seminars in this series. Many concrete problems from applications have been analyzed in this context, new algorithms were developed, approaches to break the curse of dimensionality were established, but there remain a number of important open problems. Tractability analysis will serve as a guideline and a tool for establishing complexity results and for constructing algorithms for infinite dimensional problems.\n</p> \n <p><b>Computational stochastics:</b> The focus was on weak and strong approximation as well as on the quadrature problem for stochastic ordinary or partial differential equations, i.e., on models with a random dynamics in a finite- or infinite-dimensional state space. A major topic was the complexity analysis for stochastic differential equations under non-standard assumptions.\n</p> \n <p><b>Computing and complexity in infinite dimensions:</b> Computational problems with infinitely many variables naturally arise in rather different application areas. Results and techniques from tractability analysis are available and thus permit one to study infinite dimensional problems as the limit of finite dimensional ones. Moreover, the availability of generic types of algorithms, like the multivariate decomposition method or the multi-level approach, will contribute to the complexity analysis and practical application in integration and approximation problems of infinitely many variables.\n</p> \n <p><b>Discrepancy theory:</b> Classical discrepancy theory is concerned with the question how uniformly finite point sets can be distributed. The geometric notion of discrepancy is intimately connected to the complexity of integration for functions from certain function classes. For problems in both fixed low dimension and high dimension, there are intriguing open questions whose solution would impact both fields of discrepancy theory and tractability studies. \n</p> \n <p><b>Computational/applied harmonic analysis:</b> Harmonic analysis plays an increasingly important role both in discrepancy theory and tractability analysis. One highlight is the proof of the currently best known lower bound for the star discrepancy in fixed dimension, which showed close connections between different areas, so similar techniques could be used to establish better bounds for the celebrated small ball problem for Gaussian processes. Equally important for the workshop is that many of the interesting spaces of functions occurring in numerical problems are well suited to the application of harmonic analysis. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs we understand better and better, these subjects are highly interrelated, and they are probably the most active and promising ones in the fields for the next decade. Bringing together a mix of junior and senior researchers from these diverse but interrelated subjects in a Dagstuhl seminar resulted in considerable progress both for the theory and the applications in these areas.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeminars in applied mathematics and theoretical computer science\ntypically consist of presentations, followed by short discussions\nin the plenum, and numerous informal discussions in smaller groups.\nIn this seminar, we added another new feature. A moderator was assigned to three preselected talks (based on their particular relevance \nand on the experience of the speaker) in order to inspire \na longer, in-depth discussion in the plenum. The three speakers were Jan V\u00fdbyral, Erich Novak, and Martin Hutzenthaler. The talks were scheduled as the first talks on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. It was indeed very inspiring to witness the long and deep discussions following these special talks. We feel that this format was successful and should be used also in other workshops and conferences of the community.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe work of the attendants was supported by a variety of funding agencies. This includes the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Austrian Science Fund, the National Science Foundation (USA), and the Australian Research Council. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs always, the excellent working conditions and friendly atmosphere provided by the Dagstuhl team have led to a rich exchange of ideas as well as a number of new collaborations. Selected papers related to this seminar will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Complexity. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Dmitriy Bilyk, Aicke Hinrichs, Frances Y.

            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation and Scope</h3> \n <p>\nThis fifth installment of a Dagstuhl seminar on <em>Quantum Cryptanalysis</em> was heavily informed by NIST's ongoing standardization effort in post-quantum cryptography. Several NIST employees attended the seminar and lead a discussion session on the topic. As one would hope hoped for, many talks had an algorithmic focus. Two areas were of particular interest for this seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Quantum cryptanalytic progress.</b> Identifying new cryptanalytic improvements that make use of quantum algorithms and expanding the applicability of the best known cryptanalytic attacks by means of quantum technology. Different quantum attack models can be considered here, and attack models that are close to being realizable with today's technology are particularly relevant. We want to fully leverage quantum computing, including expected mid-term advancements.\n</li><li><b>Quantum resource estimation.</b> Establishing reasonably precise quantum resource counts for cryptanalytic attacks against symmetric and asymmetric schemes, especially for problem instances and parameter choices that are actually deployed or considered for standardization for future deployment. In addition to logical resources, understanding the overhead caused by handling imperfections of quantum hardware is of interest.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn addition to original quantum cryptanalytic research, the program included presentations with a strong survey component, explaining key concepts of particular areas within post-quantum cryptography. Deviating from prior editions, this time we did not include a presentation to document the status of the development of quantum hardware. Such a talk could have been a welcome addition, but the seminar program was already packed with a substantial number of relevant cryptanalytic results, and it was important to leave sufficient time for discussions.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization</h3> \n <p>Following the organization of the prior quantum cryptanalysis seminars in Dagstuhl, for this fifth edition, again experts from academia, government, and industry came together. We  re-invited a number of leading experts in the field from the prior quantum cryptanalysis seminar edition, and at the same time invited several new participants. This included in particular young scientists, who entered this exciting research area more recently. In total, we had with 46 participants a slightly larger number of participants than in the preceding meeting. In line with the Dagstuhl tradition and with prior quantum cryptanalysis seminars, for Wednesday afternoon we left the schedule open. Seminar participants could devote the afternoon to an excursion, to discussions, or to work on their research.\n</p> \n <h3>Results and next step</h3> \n <p>\nAt this point, communication and collaboration between the classical cryptographic and the quantum algorithmic research communities has become very fruitful, and it seems fair to say that this seminar is also of significant value in supporting ongoing standardization efforts in post-quantum cryptography. In addition to quantum cryptanalytic results on asymmetric cryptography, more results on symmetric cryptography are emerging. There is still substantial research potential -- and research need -- in quantifying security margins in the presence of quantum computing, and the field keeps moving fast. Improved software tools become available to analyze quantum resources and describe quantum algorithms, bringing research in quantum cryptanalysis closer together with areas in traditional computer science.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michele Mosca, Maria Naya-Plasencia, and Rainer Steinwandt\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Computation over Compressed Structured Data",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar \"Computation over Compressed Structured Data\" took place from October 23rd to 28th, 2016. The aim was to bring together researchers from various research directions in data compression, indexing for compressed data, and algorithms for compressed data. Compression, and the ability to index and compute directly over compressed data, is a topic that is gaining importance as digitally stored data volumes are increasing at unprecedented speeds. In particular, the seminar focused on techniques for compressed <em>structured data</em>, i.e., string, trees, and graphs, where compression schemes can exploit complex structural properties to achieve strong compression ratios. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was meant to inspire the exchange of theoretical results and practical requirements related to compression of structured data, indexing, and algorithms for compressed structured data. The following specific points were addressed.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Encoding Data Structures.</b> The goal is to encode data structures with the minimal number of bits needed to support only the desired operations, which is also called the effective entropy. The best known example of such an encoding is the 2n-bit structure that answers range minimum queries on a permutation of [1,n], whose ordinary entropy is nlog(n) bits. Determining the effective entropy and designing encodings that reach the effective entropy leads to challenging research problems in enumerative combinatorics, information theory, and data structures.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Computation-Friendly Compression.</b> Existing state-of-the-art compression schemes encode data by extensive and convoluted references between pieces of information. This leads to strong compression guarantees, but often makes it difficult to efficiently perform compressed computation. Recent developments have moved towards designing more computation-friendly compression schemes that achieve both strong compression and allow for efficient computation. Precise bounds on the worst-case compression of these schemes are mostly missing so far.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Repetitive Text Collections.</b> Many of the largest sequence collections that are arising are formed by many documents that are very similar to each other. Typical examples arise from version control systems, collaborative editing systems (wiki), or sequencing of genomes from the same species. Statistical-compression does not exploit this redundancy. Recently, compressed indexes based on grammar-based compressors have been developed for repetitive text collections. They achieve a considerable compression, but on the downside operations are much slower.\n</p> \n <p><b>Recompression.</b> Recompression is a new technique that was successfully applied for the approximation of smallest string grammars and to solve several algorithmic problems on grammar-compressed strings. Recently, recompression has been extended from strings to trees. The long list of problems that were solved in a relatively short period using recompression indicates that there exist more applications of recompression.\n</p> \n <p><b>Graph Compression.</b> A lot of recent work deals with succinct data structures for graphs and with graph compression, in particular for web and network graphs. At the same time, simple queries such as in- and out-neighbors can be executed efficiently on these structures. There is a wide range of important open problems and future work. For instance, there is a strong need to support more complex graph queries, like for instance regular path queries, on compressed graphs.\n</p> <p>\nThe seminar fully satisfied our expectations. The 41 participants from 16 countries (Algiers, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Japan, Korea, Poland, Spain, and US)  had been invited by the organizers to give survey talks about their recent research related to the topic of the seminar. The talks covered topics related to compression (e.g., grammar-based compression of string, trees, and graphs, Lempel-Ziv compression), indexing of compressed data (e.g., set-intersection, longest common extensions, labeling schemes), algorithms on compressed data (e.g., streaming, regular expression matching, parameterized matching) and covered a wide range of applications including databases, WWW, and bioinformatics. Most talks were followed by lively discussions. Smaller groups formed naturally which continued these discussions later.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe thank Schloss Dagstuhl for the professional and inspiring atmosphere. Such an intense research seminar is possible because Dagstuhl so perfectly meets all researchers\u2019 needs. For instance, elaborate research discussions in the evening were followed by local wine tasting or by heated sauna sessions.\n </p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Philip Bille, Markus Lohrey, Sebastian Maneth, and Gonzalo Navarro\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Analysis of Autonomous Mobile Collectives in Complex Physical Environments",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation</h3> \n <p>\n<em>Autonomous</em> vehicles (AVs) are facing strong proof obligations. Individual AVs can be part of a <em>collective</em> (e.g. a platoon of utility vehicles on a farm field, a truck convoy on a highway, a convoy of passenger vehicles on urban road, an in-door aerial platoon, a railway convoy)\nand act within a heterogeneous environment of other collectives, for example, pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists. Multiple AVs might have to correctly and reliably negotiate their order of passing a crossing or reliably and robustly arrange in a certain work layout on agricultural land. Individuals and collectives in such environments, whether controlled in a centralised or distributed way, are subjected to change, uncertainty, and defects. Moreover,\n<em>complex environments</em> typically deny a comprehensive segregation of physical space and, hence, involve interactions with entities out of control (e.g. human-controlled machines, pedestrians, animals) and mostly also out of sight of an individual machine\u2019s (short-range)\nsensors.\n</p> \n <h3>Obejctive</h3> \n <p>\nThis seminar was centred around an application challenge, the Smart Farm. Participants were encouraged to discuss how their research addresses typical engineering tasks (ETs; upper layer in Fig. 1) to be accomplished for the given challenge or for similar challenges. These tasks include\n</p> <ol>\n<li> the identification, modelling, and analysis of operational\n  situations in complex environments\n</li><li> real-time coordination, composition, and reconfiguration of\n  machine collectives with a focus on (i) interaction with\n  human-operated systems, humans, animals, infrastructure and (ii)\n  situation-specific centralised or distributed control regimes\n</li><li> the determination of strongest safety and performance guarantees\n  with a focus on (i) the estimation of upper resilience bounds of\n  machine collectives and lower reliability bounds of individual\n  machines and (ii) the determination of strongest guarantees under\n  partial state knowledge, with minimal infrastructural support, and\n  under reduced controllability.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nIn the discussions of how the ETs can be accomplished best, we also\naimed at investigating <b>abstractions of defects and uncertainties</b>, for example:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>controller, communication, and infrastructure failures (e.g. erroneous vehicle-to-X connection and communication, deficient road infrastructure),\n</li><li>undesired interference or disturbance of autonomous operation (e.g. malicious and unintended misuse; controller, communication, and infrastructure attacks),\n</li><li>practical sensor uncertainties, actuator perturbations, and partial state knowledge.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nDefects and uncertainties are crucial for constructing <em>realistic models</em> of the behavioural spectrum of mobile collectives and yet\nabstract enough to perform <em>practical reasoning</em>.  Likewise, such\nmodels allow the necessary freedom to express ideal and actual\nbehaviour, independent of whether such behaviour is desirable.  This\nfreedom can involve the use of non-deterministic models.  In any case,\na <em>(property) specification</em> would label some of the observable\nbehaviours as <em>desirable</em>, some as <em>undesirable</em>, others\nsomewhere in between (cf. quantitative verification).  The more\ncomplete and precise such a specification, the better the distinction\nbetween correct, undesirable, and other classes of behaviours of a\ncollective.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4439/inc_semstruct.png\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <p>\nOur <b>overall objective</b> with this seminar was to gain a common\nunderstanding of acceptable safety and performance of autonomous\nmobile collectives in presence of defects and other uncertainties\ntypically occurring in complex open environments.  The\n<b>overarching approach</b> of all seminar contributions was the\n<b>formal analysis and verification of behavioural correctness</b>\nunder these assumptions (lower layer in Fig. 1) by\nusing techniques such as, e.g. theorem proving, model checking,\nrun-time verification, and model-based testing.\n\nOur <b>central assumption for this seminar</b> was that the given\napplication challenge or any similar challenges render individual\nmethods for the analysis and verification of such systems\ninsufficient.  For example, in control-theoretic models such\ncollectives are modelled by differential equations.  Interaction\nwithin and among collectives and with their environment, governing\nthese equations, cannot be easily encoded.  Approaches that express\nsuch interactions well, however, typically struggle with the detailed\ndescription of the physical laws the AVs need to adhere to.  Hence,\nfor ensuring correct behaviour in such a setting, layered\nabstractions, corresponding models, and <b>specialised reasoning techniques have to be combined</b>.\n\n</p> <h3>Organisation</h3> \n <p>Before the seminar, we provided each participant with material about\nthe application challenge (see Section 4.1) together with list of <em>engineering tasks</em> and <em>research questions</em>.  We encouraged the participants to apply their approach, if available, to at least one of the ETs of the application challenge and to answer at least one of the research questions.  Alternatively, participants were invited to present any research and practical experiences related to the seminar topic and the challenge.  Everyone was given the opportunity to give a full-length talk.\nTable 1 shows the seminar structure, the talks, and\nfurther sessions.  After the welcome session, participants introduced\nthemselves to the group.  The rest of the seminar was organised into\n<em>talk sessions</em> and <em>break-out sessions</em>.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4440/inc_timetable.png\" width=\"60%\"/> \n <p>In the talk sessions, we investigated several <b>research questions</b> from different angles.  We had talks about (1) industry challenges, (2) the analysis and verification of properties of individual autonomous vehicles (two sessions), (3) the analysis and verification of properties of autonomous collectives, and (4) the modelling of uncertainty for the (quantitative) property verification of critical autonomous systems. Nine talks dealt with an <b>introduction of a specific verification approach</b> suitable for tackling an aspect of the application challenge, including a summary of the state-of-the-art of this approach.\nFour talks were about <b>industrial examples</b> of a nature similar\nto the Smart Farm, highlighting technical challenges, encountered\nissues, and perceived practical obstacles. Five talks focused on the <b>application of a particular approach to a particular aspect of the Smart Farm</b>, addressing some of the research questions.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the following, we list the main questions and the participants\nwhose talks highlighted a particular aspect of the corresponding\nquestion.  For more details, see the list of talk abstracts below.\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>How can each ET be solved? How can we achieve safety in presence of distribution, mobility, and uncertainty? Which mechanisms fit best to ensure safety in the <em>application challenge?</em><br/>\n<em>Frederik Foldager and Peter Gorm Larsen</em>\n</li><li> How do we model the systems and verify safety and progress properties? Can we always find acceptable Pareto optima over safety and performance, at traffic level, at the level of a collective, and for individual machines?<br/>\n<em>\u00c9tienne Andr\u00e9, Sergiy Bogomolov, Kim Larsen, David Parker</em>\n</li><li> How can we exploit the structure of practical AVs and collectives to craft specific verification techniques (e.g. prevent state space explosion, identify fundamental theorems)?<br/>\n<em>Stefan Mitsch, Pedro Ribeiro</em>\n</li><li> Which benefits do we gain from integrating design-time verification, model-based testing, and run-time verification?<br/>\n<em>Mario Gleirscher, Masaki Waga</em>\n</li><li> How can verification techniques be incorporated into the development process of AVs?<br/>\n<em>J\u00f6rg Brauer, Radu Calinescu, Alessandro Fantechi, Peter Csaba \u00d6lvecky</em>\n</li><li>Which complications arise from the verification of AVs and how can we mitigate the impact of these complications, particularly, during practical verification?<br/>\n<em>Sibylle Fr\u00f6schle, Christian Heinzemann</em>\n</li></ol> \n <h3>Break-Out Sessions</h3> \n <p>To stimulate interaction, we created break-out groups on each seminar day and on the following topics: challenges of verifying autonomous collectives, the challenge of uncertainty (using, e.g. quantitative verification, parametric model checking), abstractions of space &amp; uncertainty, the impact of IT security issues on AV safety, and safe platooning. Additionally, several smaller groups (sometimes consisting of only two participants) met to discuss combinations\nand extensions of the topics they presented in their respective talks.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne break-out group focused on creating a big picture of the <b>challenges of verifying autonomous mobile collectives</b> in the Smart Farm. The identified problems include\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>estimation of behavioural properties (e.g. exact arrival times of agents, dead-lock freedom of the plan), real-time interleaving of sensing and control, and finding the \"sweet spot\" between precision and performance when used at run-time,\n</li><li> model checking at scale, when to use online or offline analysis for verification and synthesis (e.g. synthesis of distributed safety controllers for automatic repair/fallback),\n</li><li> useful architectural abstractions, compositionality, and refinement (e.g. how to safely partition the tasks of a mission between system components or whole robots?),\n</li><li> security of communication and robustness of control to communication glitches (e.g. how to integrate a jamming model into overall system verification?),\n</li><li> languages/models for dealing with system failures (e.g. how to cope with failures of individual autonomous vehicles in the context of a collective?) and component failures (e.g. how to safely integrate machine learning into autonomous systems?), and\n</li><li> safety in the presence of uncertainty (e.g. how to quantify uncertainty?, how to deal with uncertainty in parameters and in the structure of the system and the environment?).\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAnother group investigated <b>the challenge of uncertainty in modelling</b>, discussing how uncertainty (e.g. due to partial observability) can be dealt with in automated verification and how\ntechniques such as quantitative verification can be used to solve\nverification problems with uncertainties in the considered parameters.\nDepending on the Smart Farm aspect to be tackled, state-of-the-art\napproaches include the use of interval abstractions for parameters,\nthe calculation of confidence intervals for verification results, and\nthe use of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe break-out session on <b>space and uncertainty</b> stretched over all\nthree days, and was concerned with the possible ways to specify spatial\naspects, as well as how to incorporate uncertainty into such specifications.\nOur discussion proceeded on different topics. We discussed, which types of sensors allow robotic systems to gain spatial knowledge, and what levels of uncertainty can be expected. Based on this, we examined whether several layers of space are necessary and beneficial to specify both the systems and their desired properties (e.g., a discrete layer for planning high-level actions and a continuous layer, on which more local properties are ensured by controllers, as for example obstacle avoidance). Furthermore, we compared the different types of uncertainty, the level of spatial layers they occur on, and their impact on systems in the Smart Farm. This included a discussion of how much knowledge needs to be globally available, and what can be kept locally at the level of each individual entity. We realised that while the modelling scenario allowed for different levels of space and uncertainty, it was not easy and straightforward to identify necessary and interesting spatial properties to analyse. Hence, we agreed that the case study needs to allow for more degrees of freedom (e.g., different routes to reach physical targets, to permit several alternative plans).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe session about <b>IT security of farm collectives</b> focused on the aspect of communication security. First, the group identified the typical communication requirements between the actors of a smart farm such as: between a robot and a supervisory control (perhaps including a drone), between\ntwo robots that carry out a task on the same field (e.g. to carry\nout the task cooperatively or for collision avoidance), between a sensor\nand a control centre (e.g. for watering). Altogether, it became clear\nthat the operation of a smart farm critically depends on the secure\nand timely communication between the various actors. It is also clear that in the setting of the smart farm the actors must communicate over wireless channels. Hence, the usual threats against communication over an open medium apply, e.g. message spoofing and manipulation, eavesdropping and jamming. On the one hand, this requires us to employ appropriate security protocols and key management, which can guarantee origin and message authenticity as well as\nconfidentiality. On the other hand, this requires further measures against availability attacks such as jamming. The group focused on the threat of jamming. While jamming cannot be prevented in an open system the general idea was to take a 'detect and mitigate' approach. For example, jamming can be detected by the absence of regular 'heartbeat' signals and by combination with\nvisual channels. Mitigation strategies involve raising an alarm and removing the jamming device in a timely fashion while ensuring the system is not overly susceptible to false positives and denial-of-service attacks. Neither detection nor mitigation seemed trivial when discussed in detail. On the positive side, the verification methods and tools presented at the seminar could be used to evaluate possible strategies, and perhaps, even to synthesise them.\nLater on the group joined the break-out group on platooning, where ommunication is particularly critical. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the break-out session on <b>safe platooning on the farm</b>, we\ndiscussed \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>the handling of <em>planned events</em> being part of the normal\n  operation of a platoon (e.g. several farm vehicles, lorries and\n  harvesters, form a platoon including leader election; a lorry wants\n  to join or leave a harvesting platoon; a platoon with two\n  consecutive lorries needs to be rearranged; a lorry decides to leave\n  the platoon) and\n</li><li> the detection of <em>critical (not necessarily undesired)\n    events</em> to be dealt with or to recover from during normal\n  operation (e.g. a foreign vehicle, a farmer's car, enters the\n  platoon area; communication error because of a jamming attack or a\n  hardware failure disturbs the platoon controller; the current leader\n  looses trustworthiness, e.g. because of being hacked, by deviating\n  from the common goal of the platoon; farm workers enter the working\n  area of the platoon).\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nOur expectations for this first seminar were modest.  We wanted to\nlearn from each others' perspectives, to discuss available approaches,\nand to identify the hardest and most relevant <b>open challenges</b>.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur discussions opened <b>paths to an integration and application of the presented theories and models</b> (middle layer in Fig. 1), particularly, continuous models (e.g. timed and hybrid automata), uncertainty models (e.g. Markov chains, probabilistic automata), communication and coordination\nmodels (e.g. timed process algebra).  We investigated the use of such\nmodels in the context of various reasoning techniques (e.g.theorem\nproving, model checking, run-time verification, model-based testing).\nThese discussions lay a basis for the <em>derivation of guidelines</em>\non how the approaches, when applied to systems such as the Smart Farm,\ncan be combined and/or enhanced to tackle the identified problems\n<em>in practical contexts subject to certification efforts</em>.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe attendees were from various fields such as formal verification,\ntesting, certification, mechanical and control engineering, and embedded\nIT security, working at universities, in industry-oriented research\ninstitutes, or directly in industry. In this setting, we were able to <b>share experiences and insights from various application domains</b> (e.g. smart farming, smart energy systems, train/railway systems, automotive and\ntransportation), to discuss issues of the Smart Farm scenario, and to\nexamine potential research directions.  Particularly, we observe that\ncommonalities among the used approaches give rise to an <em>integrated and more versatile approach</em>.  Our participants from industry receive the opportunity to convert any of these insights into lasting process improvements in their safety-critical domains.  We expect our findings to be <em>relevant to regulatory authorities</em> in these domains.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn overall, we believe this seminar was an important step to <b>foster\ncollaboration</b> of researchers and practitioners experienced with the\ndifferent models and reasoning techniques, and to <b>initiate a research community</b> focusing on autonomous collectives of similar or\neven higher complexity than the Smart Farm. To that end, we are planning <b>further meetings</b> of the seminar's participants in the near future, to allow for further refinement of the models, and combinations of the methods\npresented. Additionally, we will further improve and <b>extend  the modelling scenario</b>, so that a particular combination of specification and verification approaches can be explored in more detail.  Eventually, we intend to collect our findings possibly in a special issue of a suitable journal.\n</p> \n <h4>Funding and Acknowledgements.</h4> \n <p>Sven Linker was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council programme grant EP/N007565/1 (S4: Science of Sensor\nSystems Software).

            "title": "New Perspectives in Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking",
            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nSymbolic Computation refers to algorithms for computers to perform symbolic mathematics, usually implemented in Computer Algebra Systems (CASs). Satisfiability Checking refers to algorithms to efficiently check the satisfiability of a logical statement, developed originally for the Boolean domain and implemented in SAT solvers, but now extended to a wide variety of different theories in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. This Dagstuhl Seminar is on Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking, with the emphasis on the \"and\" to indicate the scope is strictly work of interest to both communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nTraditionally, the two communities have been largely disjoint and unaware of the achievements of one another, despite there being strong reasons for them to discuss and collaborate, since they share many central interests.  Many of the theories tackled by SMT have been traditionally studied within Symbolic Computation; while in the opposite direction, the integration of SAT solvers into computer algebra systems can allow more powerful logical reasoning and inspire new algorithmic approaches in computer algebra.\n</p> \n <h3>Recent History</h3> \n <p>\nThe first global meeting dedicated to both symbolic computation and satisfiability checking was Dagstuhl Seminar 15471 (Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking) [1] which took place in November 2015. This was followed soon after by EU Horizon 2020 Grant 712689 which ran from 2016-2018. The aim of that project was to bridge the gap between the communities to produce individuals who can combine the knowledge and techniques of both fields to resolve problems currently beyond the scope of either [2]. The project funded new collaborations, new tool integrations, proposals on extensions to the SMT-LIB language standards, new collections of benchmarks, two summer schools (in 2017 and 2018) and the SC-Square Workshop Series.\n</p> \n <p>The Workshop Series (<a href=\"http://www.sc-square.org/workshops.html\">http://www.sc-square.org/workshops.html</a>) has taken place\nannually for six years, with two further editions already planned:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>2016</b> Timi\u015foara, Romainia (as part of SYNASC 2016).\n</li><li><b>2017</b> Kaiserslautern, Germany (alongside ISSAC 2017).\n</li><li><b>2018</b> Oxford, UK (as part of FLoC 2018).\n</li><li><b>2019</b> Bern, Switzlerland (as part of SIAM AG19)\n</li><li><b>2020</b> Paris, France (online) (alongside IJCAR 2020)\n</li><li><b>2021</b> Texas, USA (online) (as part of SIAM AG21)\n</li><li><b>2022</b> Haifa, Israel (as part of FLoC 2022)\n</li><li><b>2023</b> Troms\u00f8 Norway (alongside ISSAC 2023)\n</li></ul> \n <p>It takes place as part of, or alongside, established conferences (alternating between computational algebra and logic). Each year there are two chairs, one from each community.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn 2020 a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation was published, on the theme of SC-Square [3]. A further special issue is in development.\n</p> \n <h3>Motivation for new Seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar call defined its scope with these research questions.</p> \n <p><b>Decision Procedures:</b> How to efficiently leverage CAS for SMT over hard arithmetical theories?

            "data": "\n <h3>Background and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nThe Conversational Search Paradigm promises to satisfy information needs using human-like dialogs, be it in spoken or in written form. This kind of \"information-providing dialogs\" will increasingly happen enpassant and spontaneously, probably triggered by smart objects with which we are surrounded such as intelligent assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana, domestic appliances, environmental control devices, toys, or autonomous robots and vehicles. The outlined development marks a paradigm shift for information technology, and the key question(s) is (are):\n</p> \n <p>\nWhat does Conversational Search mean and how to make the most of it--given the possibilities and the restrictions that come along with this paradigm?\n</p> \n <p>\nCurrently, our understanding is still too limited to exploit the Conversational Search Paradigm for effectively satisfying the existing diversity of information needs. Hence, with this first Dagstuhl Seminar on Conversational Search we intend to bring together leading researchers from relevant communities to understand and to analyze this promising retrieval paradigm and its future from different angles.\n</p> \n <p>\nAmong others, we expect to discuss issues related to interactivity, result presentation, clarification, user models, and evaluation, but also search behavior that can lead into a human-machine debate or an argumentation related to the information need in question.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, we expect to define, shape, and formalize a set of corresponding problems to be addressed, as well as to highlight associated challenges that are expected to come in the form of multiple modalities and multiple users. Correspondingly, we intend to define a roadmap for establishing a new interdisciplinary research community around Conversational Search, for which the seminar will serve as a prominent scientific event, with hopefully many future events to come.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>\nA 5-day program of the seminar consisted of six introductory and background sessions, three visionary talk sessions, one industry talk session, and nine breakout discussion and reporting sessions. The seminar also had three social events during the program. The detail program of the seminar is available online.\n</p> \n <h4>Pre-Seminar Activities</h4> \n <p>\nPrior to the seminar, participants were asked to provide inputs to the following questions and request:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>\tWhat are your ideas of the \"ultimate\" conversational search system?\n</li><li>\tPlease list, from the perspective of your research field, important open questions or challenges in conversational search.\n</li><li>\tWhat are the three papers a PhD student in conversational search should read and why?\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nFrom the survey, the following topics were initially emerged as interests of participants. Many of these topics were discussed at length in the seminar.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>\tUnderstanding nature of information seeking in the context of conversational agents\n</li><li>\tModelling problems in conversational search \n</li><li>\tClarification and explanation\n</li><li>\tEvaluation in conversational search systems\n</li><li>\tEthics and privacy in conversational systems\n</li><li>\tExtending the problem space beyond the search interface and Q/A\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAnother outcome of the above pre-seminar questions was a compilation of recommended reading list to gain a solid understanding of topics and technologies that were related to the research on Conversational Search. The reading list is provided in Section 5 of this report.\n</p> \n <h4>Invited Talks</h4> \n <p>\nOne of the main goals and challenges of this seminar was to bring a broad range of researchers together to discuss Conversational Search, which required to establish common terminologies among participants. Therefore, we had a series of 18 invited talk throughout the seminar program to facilitate the understanding and discussion of conversational search and its potential enabling technologies. The main part of this report includes the abstract of all talks.\n</p> \n <h4>Working Groups</h4> \n <p>\nIn the afternoon of Day 2, initial working groups were formed based on the inputs to the pre-seminar questionnaires, introductory and background talks, and discussions among participants. On Day 3, the grouping was revisited and updated, and, eventually, the following seven groups were formed to focus on topics such as the definition, evaluation, modelling, explanation, scenarios, applications, and prototype of Conversational Search.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>\tDefining Conversational Search\n</li><li>\tEvaluating Conversational Search\n</li><li>\tModeling in Conversational Search\n</li><li>\tArgumentation and Explanation\n</li><li>\tScenarios that Invite Conversational Search\n</li><li>  Conversation Search for Learning Technologies\n</li><li>\tCommon Conversational Community Prototype: Scholarly Conversational Assistant\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nWe have summarized the working groups' outcomes in the following. Please refer to the main part of this report for the full description of the findings.\n</p> \n <h5>Defining Conversational Search</h5> \n <p>\nThis group aimed to bring structure and common terminology to the different aspects of conversational search systems that characterise the field. After reviewing existing concepts such as Conversational Answer Retrieval and Conversational Information Seeking, the group offers a typology of Conversational Search systems via functional extensions of information retrieval systems, chatbots, and dialogue systems. The group further elaborates the attributes of Conversational Search by discussing its dimensions and desirable additional properties. Their report suggests types of systems that should not be confused as conversational search systems.\n</p> \n <h5>Evaluating Conversational Search</h5> \n <p>\nThis group addressed how to determine the quality of conversational search for evaluation. They first describe the complexity of conversation between search systems and users, followed by a discussion of the motivation and broader tasks as the context of conversational search that can inform the design of conversational search evaluation. The group also surveys 12 recent tasks and datasets that can be exploited for evaluation of conversational search. Their report presents several dimensions in the evaluation such as User, Retrieval, and Dialog, and suggests that the dimensions might have an overlap with those of Interactive Information Retrieval.\n</p> \n <h5>Modeling Conversational Search</h5> \n <p>\nThis group addressed what should be modeled from the real world to achieve a successful conversational search and how. They explain why a range of concepts and variables such as capabilities and resources of systems, beliefs and goals of users, history and current status of process, and search topics and tasks should be considered to advance understanding between systems and users in the context of Conversational Search. The group points out that the options the current search engines present to users can be too broad in conversational interaction. They suggest that a deeper modeling of users' beliefs and wants, development of reflective mechanisms, and finding a good balance between macroscopic and microscopic modeling are promising directions for future research.\n</p> \n <h5>Argumentation and Explanation</h5> \n <p>\nMotivated by inevitable influences made to users due to the course of actions and choices of search engines, this group explored how the research on argumentation and explanation can mitigate some of potential biases generated during conversational search processes, and facilitate users' decision-making by acknowledging different viewpoints of a topic. The group suggests a research scheme that consists of three layers: a conversational layer, a demographics layer, and a topic layer. Also, their report explains that argumentation and explanation should be carefully considered when search systems (1) select, (2) arrange, and (3) phrase the information presented to the users. Creating an annotated corpus with these elements is the next step in this direction.\n</p> \n <h5>Scenarios for Conversational Search</h5> \n <p>\nThis group aimed to identify scenarios that invite conversational search, given that natural language conversation might not always be the best way to search in some context. Their report summarises that modality and task of search are the two cases where conversational search might make sense. Modality can be determined by a situation such as driving or cooking, or devices at hand such as a smartwatch or AR/VR systems. As for the task, the group explains that the usefulness of conversational search increases as the level of exploration and complexity increases in tasks. On the other hand, simple information needs, highly ambiguous situations, or very social situations might not be the bast case for conversational search. Proposed scenarios include a mechanic fixing a machine, two people searching for a place for dinner, learning about a recent medical diagnosis, and following up on a news article to learn more.\n</p> \n <h5>Conversation Search for Learning Technologies</h5> \n <p>\nThis group discussed the implication of conversational search from learning perspectives. The report highlights the importance of search technologies in lifelong learning and education, and the challenges due to complexity of learning processes. The group points out that multimodal interaction is particularly useful for educational and learning goals since it can support students with diverse background. Based on these discussions, the report suggests several research directions including extension of modalities to speech, writing, touch, gaze, and gesturing, integration of multimodal inputs/outputs with existing IR techniques, and application of multimodal signals to user modelling.\n</p> \n <h5>Common Conversational Community Prototype: Scholarly Conversational Assistant</h5> \n <p>\nThis group proposed to develop and operate a prototype conversational search system for scholarly activities as academic resources that support research on conversational search. Example activities include finding articles for a new area of interest, planning sessions to attend in a conference, or determining conference PC members. The proposed prototype is expected to serve as a useful search tool, a means to create datasets, and a platform for community-based evaluation campaigns. The group outlined also a road map of the development of a Scholarly Conversational Assistant. The report includes a set of software platforms, scientific IR tools, open source conversational agents, and data collections that can be exploited in conversational search work.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusions</h3> \n <p>\nLeading researchers from diverse domains in academia and industries investigated the essence, attributes, architecture, applications, challenges, and opportunities of Conversational Search in the seminar. One clear signal from the seminar is that research opportunities to advance Conversational Search are available to many areas and collaboration in an interdisciplinary community is essential to achieve the goal. This report should serve as one of the main sources to facilitate such diverse research programs on Conversational Search.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Avishek Anand, Lawrence Cavedon, Hideo Joho, Mark Sanderson, and Benno Stein\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "New Horizons in Parameterized Complexity",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIn 2019 the parameterized complexity (PC) community is celebrating two round dates: 30 years since the appearance of the paper of Abrahamson, Ellis, Fellows, and Mata in FOCS 1989, which can be considered as the starting point of PC, and 20 years since the appearance of the influential book of Downey and Fellows \"Parameterized Complexity\". \n</p> \n <p>\nIn these three decades, there has been tremendous progress in developing the area. The central vision of Parameterized Complexity through all these years has been to provide the algorithmic and complexity-theoretic toolkit for studying multivariate algorithmics in different disciplines and subfields of Computer Science. To achieve this vision, several algorithmic and complexity theoretic tools such as polynomial time preprocessing, aka kernelization, color-coding, graph-decompositions, parameterized integer programming, iterative compression, or lower bounds methods based on assumptions stronger than P=NP have been developed. These tools are universal as they did not only help in the development of the core of Parameterized Complexity, but also led to its success in other subfields of Computer Science such as Approximation Algorithms, Computational Social Choice, Computational Geometry, problems solvable in P (polynomial time) to name a few. \n</p> \n <p>\nAll cross-discipline developments result in flow of ideas and methods in both directions. In the last few years, we have witnessed several exciting developments of new parameterized techniques and tools in the following subfields of Computer Science and Optimization: Mathematical Programming, Computational Linear Algebra, Computational Counting, Derandomization, and Approximation Algorithms. A natural question is whether these domain-centric methods and tools are universal. That is, can they permeate boundaries of subfields and be employed wherever Parameterized Complexity approach can be used? The main objective of the seminar was to initiate the discussion on which of the recent \ndomain-specific algorithms and complexity advances can become useful in other domains. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar collected 46 participants from 18 countries. The participants presented their recent results in 26 invited and contributed talks. Open problems were discussed in open problem and discussion sessions.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Fedor V.

            "title": "Verification and Synthesis of Human-Robot Interaction",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThere is a growing trend in robotics moving from industrial robots that work physically separated from people to robots that collaborate and interact with people in the workplace and the home. The field of human-robot interaction (HRI) studies such interactions from the computational, design and social points of view. At the same time, there is growing interest in research regarding the safety, verification and automated synthesis of behaviors for robots and autonomous systems. The fields of formal methods and testing, which focus on verification and synthesis of systems, aim to model systems and define and prove specifications over these systems; in the context of robotics, these techniques take into account the robot dynamics and its interaction with its changing and uncertain environment. \n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, a human collaborating with a robot is not just part of the robot's environment, but an autonomous agent with intentions, beliefs, and actions that mesh with those of the robotic agent. This raises new research questions related to verification and synthesis including what appropriate models for human-robot interaction would be; whether and how algorithms for HRI can enable verification; how to take the human into account in automatic synthesis of robotic systems; and what (if any)  guarantees can be provided with a human in the loop. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo date, very little work has explored questions of verification, safety guarantees and automated synthesis in the context of Human-Robot Interaction. HRI has modeled humans computationally but not from a verification point of view and without providing guarantees. Furthermore, there are rarely any formal specifications in the computational HRI literature; validated objective metrics for evaluation are also scarce. The verification and synthesis community has mostly focused on the robot's autonomous behavior and its environment, and not paid much attention to the integral presence of the human or the interaction, including the psychological, social, and intentional aspects of human activity. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn this seminar we bring together experts in computational HRI, verification of autonomous systems, formal methods, and cognitive and social psychology to exchange ideas, define research directions, and foster collaborations toward a new theory and practice of verifiable HRI.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Hadas Kress-Gazit, Rachid Alami, Kerstin I.

            "data": "\n <p>\nQuality properties like performance and dependability are key for today's systems. \nSeveral techniques have been developed to effectively model quality properties, which allow analyzing these systems. \nHowever, the very different nature of these properties has led to the use of different techniques and mostly independent tools. \nIn addition, different tools and techniques can be used for modelling quality depending on the size and complexity of the systems and the available details. \nFor example, for modeling dependability techniques like Fault Trees, Markov Chains, and Reliability Block Diagrams are available. \nSimilarly, a range of analysis techniques are available, including simulations, using numerical, analytical or graphical techniques, and analytical methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nAlthough it is worth exploring other techniques and methodologies, model-driven engineering (MDE) seems a promising technique to efficiently design and reason about behavior and quality of systems in various domains. \nIndeed, it has been very successfully applied to improve the efficiency of software development and analysis in various domains.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, recent innovations, like the Internet of Things, production automation, and cyber-physical systems, combine several domains such as software, electronics and mechanics. \nConsequently, also the analyses for each of these individual domains need to be combined to predictively analyze the overall behavior and quality. \nThe composition of systems and their analyses is a challenging but unavoidable issue for today's complex systems. \nExisting MDE approaches to modeling and analysis are not sufficient to compose modular analyses combining domain-specific languages. \nFirst attempts towards composable modular models have been developed in recent years, attempting to compose, not only the structure of models and domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs), but also their dynamic aspects (behavior and semantics). \nThese indeed may be good foundations for building composable modular analyses.\nHowever, much work remains ahead.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this Dagstuhl Seminar, we target more flexibility in MDE by discussing how to modularize and compose models and analyses. \nThis provokes questions from the theoretical computer science and formal methods community  for example, on validity, uncertainties, behavior and property protection/preservation/reflection, and termination of analyses. \nTraditionally, research on these topics is conducted in the formal methods community isolated from the MDE community.\nA key objective for bringing together representatives from industry and researchers in the formal methods and software engineering communities is to make progress towards establishing the foundations for a common understanding. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Francisco Dur\u00e1n, Robert Heinrich, Diego P\u00e9rez-Palac\u00edn, Carolyn L.

            "title": "Computational Metabolomics: From Spectra to Knowledge",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMetabolomics is the study of small molecules in living systems, including those which generate the energy to sustain life, those that form the building blocks of macromolecules such as DNA, as well as some originating outside the living system such as pollutants. Biologically, this field is of increasing importance due to its strong connection to organism function. Metabolomics is rapidly expanding with significant advances in both measurement technology (e.g. mass spectrometry, chromatography, NMR spectroscopy) and informatics approaches. The amount and complexity of data routinely exceeds the capacity of typical software and other computational systems used in bioanalytical labs and there is an ongoing and increasingly acute need for improvements in computational, informatics and statistical/machine learning approaches to make sense of it all. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar, the fourth in the series on computational metabolomics, continued some themes previously well developed, and explored many new ones. A good example of the former is the problem of how to use mass spectral data to annotate (putatively identify) the 1000s of unknown metabolites typically observed in routine assays. Another example would be the discussion of new developments in dealing with Data Independent Acquisition which has diversified considerably in the last 5 years. Many new directions were also discussed. For instance, the question of pathway analysis - how to generate semi-automated interpretation of metabolomics data on the level of groups of molecules working together in biological processes - is becoming more prominent as larger annotated datasets become available. Another new direction was \"metaboproteomics\", looking at the diverse array of interactions between metabolites and proteins, in particular in how metabolite derived post-translational modifications of proteins can be picked up in annotation pipelines. Other discussions focused on software aspects such as visualization of chemical space (a key problem in designing effective software tools) and the generation/curation of high quality data for benchmarking new informatics algorithms. A session on extended metabolic models looked at ways to link data and prediction tools from protein function studies to metabolites in order to gain new knowledge of unknown metabolic pathways. From a data generation technology perspective, while mass spectrometry (MS) dominated as expected (e.g. sessions on MS spectral quality requirements, fragmentation trees etc), the seminar extended beyond previous ones into a discussion of NMR data processing and modeling. Open databases, repositories and knowledge representation also featured their own discussions including Wikidata, CxSMILEs and Wikipathways/RaMP-DB. Finally the important issue of integrating metabolomic data with other relevant data types (e.g. genomics, proteomics etc) was discussed. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar organization followed a similar flexible format to the previous one, where topics were both suggested in advance and brainstormed on the Monday. The whole group participated in brainstorming and prioritization and this was further refined each morning of the meeting. Parallel discussions were organized with the aim to minimize clashes in individual interests and at the end of each morning/afternoon session a plenary feedback session was held to disseminate the main discussion points to the whole group. Evening sessions were very popular and covered a wide range of topics. Overall the seminar was felt to be one of the most successful yet, highlighting the growing importance of computational metabolomics as a field in its own right and emphasizing the need for further meetings to address the important problems in this exciting area of research.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Corey Broeckling, Timothy Ebbels, Ewy Math\u00e9, and Nicola Zamboni\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Adaptive Isolation for Predictability and Security",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSemiconductor industry has shifted from processor clock speed optimization (having reached its physical limits) to parallel and heterogeneous many-core architectures. Indeed, the continuous technological scaling enables today the integration of hundred and more cores and, thus, enormous parallel processing capabilities. Whereas higher (average) performance has been and still is the major driver for any MPSoC platform design, there is a huge hesitation and fear to install such platforms in embedded systems that require predictable (boundable) guarantees of non-functional properties of execution rather than average properties for a mix of applications. Moreover, it may be observed that in an embedded system, each application running on a platform typically a) requires different qualities to be satisfied. For example, one application might demand for authentification, thus requiring the guarantee of unmodified data and program but have no requirements on speed of execution. Another application might rather require the execution to meet a set of real-time properties such as a deadline or a target data rate. To give an example, consider a driver assistance video processing application in a car that must detect obstacles in front of the car fast enough so to activate the brake system in a timely manner.  It must therefore be possible to enforce a set of non-functional qualities of execution on a multi-core platform on a per-application/job basis.  b) The above requirements on execution qualities may even change over time or during the program execution of a single application or being dependent on user or environmental settings. For example, one user might not care about sending or distributing personal information over the communication interfaces of a mobile phone whereas another one cares a lot, even in the presence of side channels.\n</p> \n <p>\nUnfortunately, the way MPSoCs are built and programmed today, the embedded system engineers often experience even worse execution qualities than in the single core case, the reason being the sharing of resources such as cores, buses and/or memory in an unpredictable way. Another obstacle for a successful deployment of multi-core technology in embedded systems is the rather unmanageable complexity. This holds particularly true for the analysis complexity of a system for predictable execution qualities at either compile-time or run-time or using hybrid analysis techniques.  The complexity is caused here by an abundant number of resources on the MPSoC and the increasing possibilities of interference created by their concurrent execution and multiple layers of software controlling program executions on a platform. Such layers are often designed for contradictory goals. For example, the power management firmware of an MPSoC may be designed to reduce the energy/power consumption or avoid temperature hot spots. The OS scheduler, on the other hand, may be designed to maximize the average CPU utilization for average performance. Providing tight bounds on execution qualities of individual applications sharing an execution platform is therefore not possible on many MPSoC platforms available today.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne remedy out of this dilemma that has been proposed a long time before the introduction of any MPSoC technology is isolation. With isolation, a set of techniques is subsumed to separate the execution of multiple programs either spatially (by allocating disjoint resources) or temporally (by separating the time intervals shared resources are used). Additionally, in order to provide isolation on demand, there is the need for adaptivity in all hardware as well as software layers from application program to executing hardware platform. Indeed, adaptivity is considered a key topic in order to reduce or bound execution quality variations actively on a system and in an on-demand manner for the reason to neither overly restrict nor to underutilize available resources.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdaptive Isolation, the topic of the proposed Dagstuhl seminar, may be seen as a novel and important research topic for providing predictability of not only timing but also security and may be even other properties of execution on a multi-core platform on a per application/job basis while easing and trading off compile-time and run-time complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nFirst, a common understanding of which techniques may be used for isolation including hardware units design, resource reservation protocols, virtualization techniques, and including novel hybrid and dynamic resource assignment techniques were discussed. Second, a very interdisciplinary team of experts including processor designers, OS and compiler specialists, as well as experts for predictability and security analysis were brought together for evaluating these opportunities and presenting novel solutions. The competencies, experiences, and existing solutions of the multiple communities stimulated discussions and co-operations that hopefully will manifest in innovative research directions for enabling predictability on demand on standard embedded MPSoCs.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Tulika Mitra and J\u00fcrgen Teich and Lothar Thiele\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "AI for the Social Good",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAI and ML have made impressive progress in the last few years. Long-standing challenges like Go have fallen and the technology has entered daily use via the vision, speech or translation capabilities in billions of smartphones. The pace of research progress shows no signs of slowing down, and demand for talent is unprecedented. But as part of a wider AI for Social Good trend, this seminar wanted to contribute to ensuring that the social good does not become an afterthought in the rapid AI and ML evolution, but that society benefits as a whole. The five-day seminar brought together AI and ML researchers from various universities with representatives from NGOs based in Benin, Tanzania, Uganda, The Netherlands and globally. These NGOs all pursue various social good goals, such as improving air quality, increasing agricultural productivity with the help of technology, transforming health care, providing humanitarian support, and defeating poverty. On these topics, NGOs have rich domain knowledge, just like they have vast networks with (non-)governmental actors in developing countries. Mostly, NGOs have their finger on the pulse of the challenges that the world and especially its most vulnerable inhabitants are facing today, and will be facing tomorrow. The objective of the seminar was to look at these challenges through an AI and ML lens, to explore if and how these technologies could help NGOs to address these challenges. The motivation was also that collaborations between AI and ML researchers and NGOs could benefit both sides: on the one hand, the new techniques can help with prediction, data analysis, modelling, or decision making. On the other hand, the NGOs' domains contain many non-standard conditions, like missing data, side-effects, or multiple competing objectives, all of which are fascinating research challenges in themselves. And of course, publication impact is substantially enhanced when a method has real-world impact. The seminar facilitated the exploration of possible collaborations between AI and ML researchers and NGOs through a two-pronged approach. This approach combined high-level talks and discussions on the one hand with a hands-on hackathon on the other hand. High-level talks and discussions focused first on the central concepts and theories in AI and ML and in the NGOs' development work, before diving into specific issues such as generalisability, data pipelines, and explainability. These talks and discussions allowed all participants - in a very short time-frame - to reach a sufficient level of understanding of each other's work. This understanding was the basis to then start investigating jointly through a hackathon how AI and ML could help addressing the real-world challenges presented by the NGOs. At the start of the hackathon, an open marketplace-like setting allowed AI and ML researchers and NGOs to find the best match between technological supply and demand. When teams of researchers and NGOs were established, their initial objective was not to start coding, but to define objectives, assess scope and feasibility. The intense exchanges during the hackathon allowed NGOs with a lower AI/ML maturity increased to increase understanding of the capabilities of AI/ML and define actions to effectively start working with AI/ML. NGOs that already had a more advanced understanding and use of AI/ML technology prior to the seminar, could take their AI maturity to the next level by trying out new ML approaches, designing and testing tailored ML models, or simply exploring new partnerships. Key to this success of the hackathon - and the seminar at large - was the presence of AI/ML experts whose respective fields of expertise could seamlessly be matched with the various needs of the various NGOs. This excellent group composition also facilitated a productive discussion about guidelines on how to do effective AI for social good collaborations in the future (e.g. by focusing on long-term partnerships, and by sequencing problem scoping before data cleaning and - only in last instance - an actual hackathon).\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ruben De Winne\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nInductive programming addresses the automated or semi-automated generation of computer\nprograms from incomplete information such as input-output examples, constraints, computation\ntraces, demonstrations, or problem-solving experience [11]. The generated \u2013 typically\ndeclarative \u2013 program has the status of a hypothesis which has been generalized by induction.\nThat is, inductive programming can be seen as a special approach to machine learning. In\ncontrast to standard machine learning, only a small number of training examples is necessary.\nFurthermore, learned hypotheses are represented as logic or functional programs, that is,\nthey are represented on symbol level and therefore are inspectable and comprehensible\n[36, 15, 37, 29]. On the other hand, inductive programming is a special approach to program\nsynthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches [39, 25, 4]. In cases\nwhere synthesis of specific algorithm details that are hard to figure out by humans inductive\nreasoning can be used to generate program candidates from either user-provided data such\nas test cases or from data automatically derived from a formal specification [35]. Finally,\nsymbolic approaches can be combined with probabilistic methods [8, 9].\n</p> \n <p>\nInductive program synthesis is of interest for researchers in artificial intelligence since the\nlate sixties [2]. On the one hand, the complex intellectual cognitive processes involved in\nproducing program code which satisfies some specification are investigated, on the other hand\nmethodologies and techniques for automating parts of the program development process are\nexplored. One of the most relevant areas of application of inductive programming techniques\nis end-user programming [5, 22, 6]. For example, the Microsoft Excel plug-in Flashfill\nsynthesizes programs from a small set of observations of user behavior [15, 14, 13]. Related\napplications are in process mining and in data wrangling [19, 21]. Inductive programming in\ngeneral offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data [30, 23] and to learning\nfrom observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents [28, 20, 36]. Furthermore,\ninductive programming can be applied in the context of teaching programming [38, 41].\nA recent new domain of interest is how to combine inductive programming with blackbox\napproaches, especially in the context of (deep) neural networks [10] and in data science.\n</p> \n <h3>Relation to Previous Dagstuhl-Seminars</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar is a continuation Dagstuhl-Seminars 13502, 15442, and 17382. In the first\nseminar, the focus was on establishing the research community by exploring the different areas\nof basic research and applications of inductive programming and identifying commonalities\nand differences in methods and goals. In the second seminar, more in-depth coverage of\nalgorithmic methods was provided and the relation of inductive programming to cognitive\nmodeling was explored. The third seminar had a main focus on applications in data cleansing,\nteaching programming, and interactive training. Furthermore, first proposals for neural\napproaches to learning for inductive programming were presented.\n</p> \n <p>\nBesides many new insights from many discussions, visible outcomes from the previous seminars are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Muggleton, S.H., Schmid, U., Zeller, C., Tamaddoni-Nezhad, A. and T.

Consequently, interfaces which explain (aspects) of classifier decisions have been\nproposed \u2013 especially in the context of deep learning [32, 3]. The notion of explainability has\nalready been addressed in the early days of machine learning: During the 1980s Michie defined\nMachine Learning in terms of two orthogonal axes of performance: predictive accuracy and\ncomprehensibility of generated hypotheses. Since predictive accuracy was readily measurable\nand comprehensibility not so, later definitions in the 1990s, such as that of Mitchell [27],\ntended to use a one-dimensional approach to Machine Learning based solely on predictive\naccuracy, ultimately favouring statistical over symbolic Machine Learning approaches.\n</p> \n <h3>Inductive Programming and Neural Computation</h3> \n <p>The deep learning community has been interested in taking on challenging tasks from the\nartificial intelligence community. It is therefore no surprise that they have also started to\nlook into inductive and automatic programming. In particular, they have contributed several mixtures of traditional computational models with those of neural networks. For instance,\nthe neural Turing machine [12] integrates a neural network with an external memory and it is\nable to learn simple algorithms such as copy and sort, the neural program interpreter [31] is a\nrecurrent neural network that learns to represent and execute programs from program traces,\nwhile [33] present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language\nForth and [34, 24] for a declarative Prolog like language. The central goal in these approaches\nis to obtain an end-to-end differentiable model. While initial results are promising, the\napproaches still require a lot of data to be trained or need to scale up. This contrasts with the\nmore traditional symbolic approaches to inductive programming and thus a key opportunity\nis to further cross-fertalize these two approaches.\n</p> \n <h3>Inductive Programming and Human-like Computing</h3> \n <p>The human ability to master complex demands is to a large extend based on the ability to\nexploit previous experiences. Based on our experience, we are able to predict characteristics\nor reactions of (natural or man-made, inanimate or animate) objects, we can reason about\npossible outcomes of actions, and we can apply previously successful routines and strategies\nto new tasks and problems. In philosophy, psychology and artificial intelligence, researchers\nproposed that the core process to expand knowledge, that is, construct hypotheses, in such a\nway that we can transfer knowledge from previous experience to new situations is inductive\ninference [18, 16, 40].\n</p> \n <p>One special aspect of induction is that humans are able to acquire complex, productive\nrule sets from experience. Following Chomsky, rules are productive when they can be applied\nin situations of various complexity. Typical examples of such rule sets are knowledge about\nnatural language grammar, recursive concepts such as ancestor and recursive problem solving\nstrategies. For example, if humans have learned how to solve Tower of Hanoi problems with\nthree and four discs, at least some of them are able to generalize the underlying strategy for\nsolving problems with an arbitrary number of discs.\n</p> \n <p>Inductive programming provides mechanisms to generate such productive, recursive rule\nsets. Examples of recent work on using inductive programming to model this learningcapability\nof human cognition are [26, 20, 36, 17, 23]. Therefore, it might be fruitful for\ncognitive scientists to get acquainted with inductive programming as one approach to model\nthe acquisition of complex knowledge structures. On the other hand, knowledge gained from\nexperiments in human problem solving, concept learning and language acquisition can be a\nsource of inspiration for new algorithmic approaches to inductive programming.\n</p> \n <h3>Objectives and Expected Outcomes of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The previous seminars resulted in new collaborations between researchers from different\nbackgrounds as documented in joint publications and we expect that the collaborations will\ncontinue, deepen and extend, resulting not only in further joint publications but also in joint\nresearch projects.\n</p> \n <p>In the fourth seminar, we continued and extended previous discussions addressing the\nfollowing aspects:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Identifying the specific contributions of inductive programming to machine learning research and applications of machine learning, especially identifying problems for which inductive programming approaches are more suited than standard machine learning approaches, including deep learning and probabilistic programming. Focus here is on possibilities of combining (deep) neural approaches or probabilistic programming with (symbolic) inductive programming, especially with respect to new approaches to comprehensibility of machine learned models and on explainable AI.\n</li><li> Establishing criteria for evaluating inductive programming approaches in comparison to each other and in comparison to other approaches of machine learning and providing a set of benchmark problems.\n</li><li> Discussing current applications of inductive programming in end-user programming and programming education and identifying further relevant areas of application.\n</li><li> Establishing stronger relations between cognitive science research on inductive learning and inductive programming under the label of human-like computation.\n</li><li> Strengthening the relation of inductive programming and data science, especially with respect to data cleansing and data wrangling.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Concluding Remarks and Future Plans</h3> \n <p>In the wrapping-up section, we decided to move the IP webpage to a Wiki and encouraged all participants to make available their systems, tutorial/lecture slides and publications there.\nAs the grand IP challenge we came up with 2017 is still up:\n</p> \n <p>An IP program should invent an algorithm publishable in a serious journal (e.g., an\ninteger factorization algorithm) or win a programming competition!</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Daniel W.

            "title": "Databases on Future Hardware",
            "data": "\n <p>\nComputing hardware is undergoing radical changes. Forced by physical\nlimitations (mainly <em>heat dissipation</em> problems), systems trend\ntoward <em>massively parallel</em> and <em>heterogeneous</em> designs.  New\ntechnologies, <em>e.g.</em>, for <em>high-speed networking</em> or\n<em>persistent storage</em> emerge and open up new opportunities for the\ndesign of database systems.  This push by technology was the main\nmotivation to bring top researchers from different\ncommunities - particularly hard- <em>and</em> software -- together to a\nDagstuhl seminar and have them discuss about \"Databases on Future\nHardware.\"  This report briefly summarizes the discussions that took\nplace during the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nWith regards to the mentioned <em>technology push</em>, during the seminar\n<em>bandwidth</em>; <em>memory and storage technologies</em>; and\n<em>accelerators</em> (or other forms of specialized computing\nfunctionality or instruction sets) were considered the most pressing\ntopic areas in database design.\n</p> \n <p>\nBut it turned out that the field is influenced also by a strong push\nfrom <em>economy/market</em>.  New types of <em>applications</em> - in\nparticular Machine Learning - as well as the emergence of \"compute\" as\nan independent type of resources - <em>e.g.</em>, in the form of\n<em>cloud computing</em> or <em>appliances</em> - can have a strong impact\non the viability of a given system design.\n</p> \n <h4>Bandwidth; Memory and Storage Technologies</h4> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, probably the most often stated issue in the field\nwas <em>bandwidth</em> - at various places in the overall system stack,\nsuch as CPU &lt;--&gt;,memory; machine &lt;--&gt; machine (network); access to secondary\nstorage (<em>e.g.</em>, disk, SSD, NVM).  But very interestingly, the\nissue was not only brought up as a key limitation to database\nperformance by the seminar attendees with a software background.\nRather, it also became clear that the hardware side, too, is very actively\nlooking at bandwidth.  The networking community is working at ways to\nprovide more bandwidth, but also to provide hooks that allow the software\nside to make better use of the available bandwidth.  On the system\narchitecture side, new interface technologies (<em>e.g.</em>, NVlink,\navailable in IBM's POWER8) aim to ease the bandwidth bottleneck.\n</p> \n <p>\nBandwidth usually is a problem only <em>between</em> system components.\nTo illustrate, HMC memories (\"hybrid memory cube\") provide only\n320 GB/s of external bandwidth, but internally run at 512 GB/s per\ncube (\"vault\"); in a 16-vault configuration, this corresponds to\n8 TB/s of internal bandwidth.  This may open up opportunities to build\nheterogeneous system designs with <em>near-data processing</em>\ncapabilities.  HMC memory units could, for instance, contain (limited)\nprocessing functionality associated with every storage vault.  This way,\nsimple tasks, such as data movement, re-organization, or scanning could\nbe off-loaded and performed right where the data resides.  Similar\nconcepts have been used, <em>e.g.</em>, to filter data in the network,\npre-process data near secondary storage, etc.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn breakout sessions during the seminar, attendees discussed the\nimplications that such system designs may have. Most importantly, the\ndesigns will require to re-think the existing <em>(programming)\ninterfaces</em>.  How does the programmer express the off-loaded task?\nWhich types of tasks can be off-loaded? What are the limitations of the\nnear-data processing unit (<em>e.g.</em>, which memory areas can it\naccess)?  How do host processor and processing unit exchange tasks,\ndata, and results?  Clearly, a much closer collaboration will be needed\nbetween the hard- and software sides to make this route viable.\n</p> \n <p>\nBut new designs may also shake up the commercial market. The\ntraditional hardware market is strongly separated between the memory and\nlogic worlds, with different manufacturers and processes. Breaking up\nthe separation may be a challenge both from a technological and from a\nbusiness/market point of view.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe group found only little time during the seminar to discuss another\npotential game-changer in the memory/storage space. Companies are about\nto bring their first <em>non-volatile memory (NVM)</em> components to the\nmarket (and, in fact, Intel released its first round of \"3D XPoint\"\nproducts shortly after the seminar). The availability of cheap,\nhigh-capacity, byte-addressable, persistent storage technologies will\nhave profound impact on database software.  Discussions during the\nseminar revolved around the question whether classical persistent\n(disk-based) mechanisms or in-memory mechanisms are more appropriate to\ndeal with the new technology.\n</p> \n <h4>Accelerators</h4> \n <p>\nA way of dealing with the technology trend toward heterogeneity is to\nenrich general-purpose systems with more specialized processing units,\n<em>accelerators</em>.  Popular incarnations of this idea are\n<em>graphics processors (GPUs)</em> or <em>field-programmable gate\narrays (FPGAs)</em>; but there are also co-processing units for\nfloating-point arithmetics, multimedia processing, or network\nacceleration.\n</p> \n <p>\nAccelerators may fit well with what was said above. <em>E.g.</em>, they\ncould be used as near-data processing units.  But also the challenges\nmentioned above apply to many accelerator integration strategies.\nSpecifically, the proper <em>programming interface</em>, but also the role\nof an accelerator in the software system stack - <em>e.g.</em>, sharing it\nbetween processes - seem to be yet-unsolved challenges.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, also the role of accelerators specifically for\ndatabase systems was discussed. It was mentioned, on the one hand, that\naccelerators should be used to accelerate functionality outside the\ndatabase's core tasks, because existing hard- and software is actually\nquite good at handling typical database tasks. On the other hand,\nattendees reported that many of the non-core-database tasks, Machine\nLearning in particular, demand a very high flexibility that is very hard\nto provide with specialized hardware.\n</p> \n <h4>New Applications / Machine Learning</h4> \n <p>\nDatabases are the classical device to deal with high volumes of data.\nWith the success of Machine Learning in many fields of computing, the\nquestion arises how databases and Machine Learning applications should\nrelate to one another, and to which extent the database community should\nembrace ML functionality in their system designs.\n</p> \n <p>\nSome of the seminar attendees have, in fact, given examples of very\nimpressive and successful systems that apply ideas from database\nco-processing to Machine Learning scenarios. In a breakout session on\nthe topic, it was concluded that the two worlds should still be treated\nseparately also in the future.\n</p> \n <p>\nA key challenge around Machine Learning seems to be the very high\nexpectations with regard to the flexibility of the system. ML tasks are\noften described in high-level languages (such as R or Python) and demand\nexpressiveness that goes far beyond the capabilities of efficient\ndatabase execution engines.  Attempts to extend these engines with\ntailor-made ML operators were not very well received, because even the\nnew operators were too restrictive for ML users.\n</p> \n <h4>Economic/Market Considerations</h4> \n <p>\nSomewhat unexpectedly, during the seminar it became clear that the\ninterplay of databases and hardware is not only a question of\ntechnology.  Rather, examples from the past and present demonstrate that\neven a technologically superior database solution cannot survive today\nwithout a clear business case.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe concept of <em>cloud computing</em> plays a particularly important\nrole in these considerations. From a business perspective, compute\nresources - including database functionality - have become a commodity.\nCompanies move their workloads increasingly toward cloud-based systems,\nraising the question whether the future of databases is also in the\ncloud.\n</p> \n <p>\nA similar line of arguments leads to the concept of <em>database\nappliances</em>.  Appliances package database functionality in a closed box,\nallowing <em>(a)</em> to treat the service as a commodity (business aspect)\nand <em>(b)</em> to tailor hard- and software of the appliance specifically\nto the task at hand, with the promise of maximum performance (technology\naspect).\n</p> \n <p>\nAnd, in fact, both concepts - cloud computing and appliances - may go well\ntogether. Cloud setups enable to control the entire hard- and software\nstack; large installations may provide the critical mass to include\ntailor-made (database) functionality also within the cloud.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jens Teubner\n                </div> \n",

Sherif was a leading scientist in the field of Big Data Technologies. We are grateful to him for the time spent together and the joint work preceding and following the seminar. He will be deeply missed.</em>\n</p> \n <p>\nThe world has become more interconnected than ever. Through an advancing wave of technologies and applications, our society is producing and consuming data at an unprecedented scale and complexity. \nTo model the data, graphs offer a general model and mathematical abstraction, in the simplest form based on arbitrary objects (vertices) connected by  relationships (edges), with possibly additional information (properties). \nGraphs enable already a remarkable range of application domains, from industry to science, from society to governance, from education to gaming,\nbut their true potential is just beginning to be unlocked. \nHowever, the tremendous increase in the size, complexity, and diversity of the graph-structured data and their applications, and the increasing community using graphs to understand and automate the world around us, raises new challenges for computer science. \nUnder these new circumstances, the potential benefits of graph processing could be canceled by the difficulty to understand, create, develop, and automate graph processing for the masses.\nFocusing on the interplay between graph data, abstractions, systems, performance engineering, and software engineering, \nthis seminar brings together researchers, developers, and practitioners actively working on this topic, to discuss emph{timely and relevant} open challenges with a main focus on the following topics: \ntrade-off of design decisions of big graph processing systems, \nhigh-level graph programming abstractions and graph query languages, \nthe specific requirements for different application domains for benchmarking and graph engineering purposes,\nsystems and ecosystems for graph processing,\nthe fundamental processes and methods leading to the science, design, and engineering of graph processing.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar focused on the following key topics related to big graph processing systems:\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Topic 1. Design Decisions of Big Graph Processing Ecosystems:</b> In modern setups, graph-processing is not a self-sustained, independent activity, but rather part of a larger big-data processing ecosystem. Typical examples include the Giraph's deployment in the Facebook MapReduce ecosystem, \nPowergraph in the GraphLab machine learning and data-mining ecosystem, and \nGraphX in the Apache Spark ecosystem. In general, more alternatives usually mean harder decisions for choice. In practice, with the wide spectrum of big graph processing systems, with different design decisions, that are currently available, it becomes very challenging to decide by intuition which system is the most adequate for a given application requirements, workload, or the underlying ecosystem. Making such decisions requires significant knowledge about the graph complexity, graph size, world requirements, and even the implementation details of the various available systems. Currently, we lack the fundamental models to understand and quantitatively analyze, estimate, and describe the complexity of big graph processing jobs. In addition, there is no understanding on the relationship between the graph complexity and the computational complexity of big graph processing jobs. Therefore, we need a clear understanding for the impact and the trade-offs of the various decisions (e.g., centralized vs distributed, partitioning strategy, programming model, graph representation model, memory storage vs disk storage) in order to effectively guide the developers of big graph processing applications.\n</p> \n <p><b>Topic 2. High-Level Graph Processing Abstractions:</b>\nWhile imperative programming models, such as <em>vertex-centric</em> or <em>edge-centric</em> programming models, are popular, they are lacking a high-level exposition to the end user. \nThis way the end user is required more technical programming, which limits the end user productivity in building graph processing pipelines.\nIn contrast, graph query languages build on more high-level, declarative constructs.\nQuery language abstraction give more power to the less technical user and allow for extensive performance optimization by the underlying graph processing system.\nCurrent graph query languages, however, lack the power required in many graph analytics use cases.\nTo increase the power of graph processing systems and foster the usage of graph analytics in applications, we need to design high-level graph processing abstractions.\nIt is currently completely open how future declarative graph processing abstractions could look like, which the best level of abstraction is, how abstraction for analytics integrate with existing graph query languages, and we can evaluate new graph processing abstractions regarding utility, simplicity, expressiveness, and optimization potential.\n</p> \n <p><b>Topic 3. Performance and Scalability Evaluation:</b> Traditionally, performance and scalability are measures of efficiency, contrasting the ability of systems to utilize resources: FLOPS, throughput (e.g., EVPS), or speedup (i.e., compared to either a single-node, or a sequential implementation). Such metrics are difficult to apply for graph processing, especially since performance is non-trivially dependent on <em>platform</em>, <em>algorithm</em>, and <em>dataset</em> (i.e., the PAD triangle). Therefore, many important questions arise: <em>how to compare the performance of graph-processing systems?, how to define scalability?, should one compare largely different systems, e.g., a distributed, heterogeneous system with a highly-tuned, hand-written sequential implementation?, how to design a framework for reproducible performance evaluation?</em>. Moreover, running graph-processing workloads in the cloud leverages additional challenges. First, we would like to understand whether the intrinsic cloud elasticity could be harnessed for graph processing. Second, clouds are known to be impacted by large degrees of performance variability due to colocation and virtualization overheads. Studying the impact of cloud performance variability onto graph-processing workloads is another topic of interest. Such performance-related issues are key to identify, design, and build upon widely recognized benchmarks for graph processing. \n </p> \n <p>\nFor each topic, the discussion also considered specific and general applications of graph processing, at various volume, velocity, and other dimensions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together over 40 diverse and high quality researchers with core expertise from two generally distinct communities, data management and (large-scale) computer systems. The seminar was successful, and addressed in particular topics around graph processing systems: ecosystems, abstractions and other fundamental theory, and performance. To this end, we structured the seminar as follows:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Prior to the seminar, the co-organizers have contacted each participant, eliciting commitment for one or several topics, and ideas for key elements of the discussion.\n</li><li> During the first day of the seminar, the morning was dedicated to short presentations by each participant, and a long break-out session per topic. The former allowed the participants to better understand each other's core ideas and keywords, to identify synergies and to find experts for keywords not entirely familiar.\n</li><li> For the next two days, each morning challenged at least one half the participants with a tutorial given by a leading expert from the <em>other</em> community, then proceeded with break-out sessions organized per topic, and ended with a plenary session to share the main ideas. The tutorials were given by Tamer \u00d6zsu on \"Graph Processing: A Panoramic View and Some Open Problems\", on behalf of the data management community, and by Antonino Tumeo on \"Big Graph Processing: The System Perspective\", on behalf of the systems community. The main results of these two days of intense work were making terminology more uniform across the participants, and the core ideas about challenges (open problems), directions for long-term research, and identification of concrete short-term plans for continuation.\n</li><li> During the last day of the seminar, the participants finalized the immediate conclusions of the seminar (see Section \"In Conclusion: Challenges and Future Directions for Big Graph Processing Systems\"), and agreed on the plans for continuation.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Alexandru Iosup, Angela Bonifati, Sherif Sakr, and Hannes Voigt\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nFor the majority of human existence, the visual language has been successfully used to communicate complex ideas that span across borders of knowledge, experience, age, gender, culture, and time.  These aspects also make it an effective form of expressing workflows in scientific data analysis as well as the communication of scientific discoveries to broad audiences.  The Dagstuhl Seminar 19262 brought together researchers from computer science, content producers, learning and communication experts, and domain experts from astronomy and astrophysics to define the emerging field of interactive visualization of space exploration and astronomy, referred to as Astrographics.\nThis seminar played an important role in the ongoing process of removing the clear division between using visualization to enable scientific discoveries by subject-matter experts (exploratory visualization) and using visual representations to explain and communicate the results of such exploratory science to a greater, general audience (explanatory visualization).  Designing the available visualization tools to serve both roles at the same time increases the overlap between these two aspects of visualization and allows scientists to better explain their findings and, at the same time, enables the general public to use similar tools for their own, guided, discovery and actively participate in the scientific process.\nThe field of astronomy and astrophysics has been at the forefront of this process since the beginning as it is a primary example of a domain in which exploratory and explanatory visualizations have served important but distinct roles.  For this reason, astrographics was chosen as the domain in which to explore the challenges and opportunities that arise when combining exploratory and explanatory techniques.\nThe bulk of work in this seminar occurred in focussed break-out sessions that reported their findings back to the group and opened up the topics for joint discussions.  Topics of these break-out sessions included discussions on better integration of software tools, improvements of analysis tools, preparing astrographics software packages to improve the quality of public presentations, the ability of sharing presentations both in spatially distant locations as well as saving them for later playback.  Finally, there was a working group to work on a decadal white paper for astronomy [1].\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Jacqueline K.

            "title": "Synergies among Testing, Verification, and Repair for Concurrent Programs",
            "data": "\n <h3>Context and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nMajor trends in computing infrastructure, such as multicore processors and data centers, increase the demand for concurrent software that utilizes the available resources. However, concurrent programs are notoriously difficult to develop. They are susceptible to a number of specific errors that do not occur in sequential code, such as data races, deadlock, atomicity violations, starvation, and violations of consistency models. These errors typically manifest themselves only in certain executions (for instance, under certain thread schedules), which makes them extremely difficult to detect, reproduce, localize, and repair. Established techniques for testing, verifying and repairing sequential programs are insufficient to handle concurrent software. In particular, they do not address the following challenges:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>State space explosion:</em> The execution of a concurrent program depends not only on the inputs but also on the thread schedule and optimizations, such as memory reordering. This results in an state space that is orders of magnitude larger than for sequential programs. Bug-finding techniques, such as testing and bounded model checking, require effective ways of pruning the state space. Static verification techniques, such as deductive verification and abstract interpretation, require suitable abstractions that allow one to reason about all possible program behaviors. Finally, program repair requires techniques to predict the impact of a program change on the set of possible executions.\n</li><li><em>Modularity:</em> Modular techniques, such as unit testing or compositional verification, scale to large applications. However, for many properties of concurrent programs there are no modular techniques, or they require a large annotation overhead, for instance to denote the locations protected by a lock or to specify a locking order (or discipline) that ensures deadlock freedom. It is crucial to develop techniques that allow programs to be checked and repaired modularly, for instance to fix an atomicity violation by adding more thread synchronization, but without introducing a deadlock globally.\n</li><li><em>Specifications:</em> Testing, verification and repair may rely on specifications that express the intended program behavior, for instance in the form of test oracles or program invariants. In addition to functional properties, specifications for concurrent programs also have to express how threads cooperate, for instance via a global locking strategy. While various specification approaches exist for concurrent programs, there is no uniform formalism that handles the full range of concurrency idioms and that supports testing, verification and repair.\n</li><li><em>Error reporting:</em> Testing, verification and repair techniques need to disambiguate true problems from spurious defects, which is often difficult in concurrent programs. For instance, a data race is not necessarily a bug. If a race occurs within a lock-free data structure, then it may be admissible as part of some higher-level transactional behavior enforced by the data-structure operation. Moreover, it is important to present bugs in an understandable manner, for instance by providing reports with only a small number of threads and by determining whether a bug is inherently concurrent or may also arise in a sequential context.\n</li><li> <em>Liveness:</em> Whereas for most sequential programs, termination is the only relevant liveness property, liveness (such as fairness or the absence of livelocks) is often more prevalent in concurrent programs. It is, therefore, important to develop techniques to check and enforce progress.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Program testing, verification, and repair each offer partial solutions to these challenges. This seminar was conceived with the goal of bringing together these three communities in order to develop a common understanding of the issues as well as to enable collaboration at the level of techniques and tools.\n</p> \n <h3>Main Themes</h3> \n <p>\nThe first step toward exposing, and enabling, synergies between the three main threads of research on correctness and reliability of concurrent programs -- verification, testing and repair -- is to analyze the challenges and contributions pertaining to each of these areas in isolation. We survey work that has been done in each of these communities, based on the available literature and presentations given in the seminar, to summarize the current state of the three communities.\n</p> \n <h4>Verification</h4> \n <p>A main challenge in verification of concurrency properties is the prohibitive state space unfolded by thread interleavings. A hybrid solution to this problem is to specialize the static abstraction according to necessary proof conditions, arising during dynamic runs, such that the verification algorithm can scale with fine-grained abstractions (Naik, Yang). Another approach is to retain correlations among local thread states as well as the shared program state (Sagiv, Segalov). In this way, useful invariants can be proved and exploited by the verifier even if an unbounded number of threads is assumed. Refinement techniques are useful when little information is required about the environment to prove a property (Gupta). A useful idea in error reporting is to pinpoint concurrency-specific bugs (differentiating them from sequential bugs) by also running a sequential verifier and performing delta analysis (Joshi). Much like other techniques, verification greatly benefits from user specifications. For example, a parallelizing compiler is more likely to prove disjointness between loop iterations if relevant data structures (or operations) are specified as linearizable (Rinard, Diniz).  This also provides a measure of modularity, enabling the separation between library linearizability checking and client verification. Modern program logics (O\u2019Hearn, Parkinson, Gardner) provide a way of constructing correctness proofs for concurrent programs, though in general modular verification of concurrent software remains a hard problem.\n</p> \n <h4>Testing</h4> \n <p>Similarly to verification, testing techniques are also challenged by the state-space problem. Several ideas have been proposed in response to this problem. Open-world testing, whereby data structures or libraries referenced by an application are tested in isolation for concurrency bugs (e.g., atomicity violations), reduces the scope of testing considerably (Shacham). Interestingly, even open-world issues that cannot be recreated within the client application are often fixed by developers, which encourages further research into modular consistency properties (e.g., linearizability) (Shacham). Predictive analysis is a recent form of testing that holds the promise of high coverage at an affordable cost (Smaragdakis). Starting from a concrete trace, predictive analysis applies feasibility-preserving transformations (reordering trace events, typically through constraint solving) to detect concurrency bugs, such that soundness is guaranteed (Dolby, Huang). Another source of state-space reduction is to exploit high-level semantic guarantees, like atomicity, to abstract away intermediate trace transitions (Shacham, Tripp). This also relates to error reporting, where certain read/write conflicts give rise to spurious conflicts that can be eliminated with a higher-level view of conflict as lack of commutativity between atomic operations (Koskinen, Kulkarni). Contrary to memory-level conflict detection, commutativity-based testing requires a specification (Shacham, Tripp). Another form of specification refers to consistency relaxations, e.g. permitting certain types of read/write conflict (Thies) or specifying a computation as nondeterministic (Burnim, Tripp).\n</p> \n <h4>Repair</h4> \n <p>In program repair, error reporting (or localization) plays a key role, deciding the effective scope and nature of the fix. Pinpointing the exact conditions that give rise to a concurrency bug is thus critical, emphasizing the need for better testing and verification tools. Importantly, incorrect fixing may introduce concurrency bugs (e.g., a deadlock resulting from additional synchronization to fix an atomicity violation), which again highlights the need for better synergy between repair and testing/verification (Liu). Incorrect fixing also turns liveness into a concrete concern: Assuming the program previously terminated, does it also terminate after the fix? Existing solutions that ensure termination rely on iterative transformation methods as well as specialized models like Petri nets (Liu, Zhang). A common assumption in the repair community, to hold back the state-space challenge, is that concurrency bugs involve a small number of threads (typically 2) (Liblit, Liu). The hope is that better synergy with testing and verification can work toward relaxing this assumption. Semantic lifting of the concrete code, exploiting e.g. linearizability, has recently been demonstrated as a useful means to apply bottom-up/top-down fixing: First, the code is lifted into an abstract workflow, and then the workflow is concretized into a correct reimplementation (Liu, Tripp). This motivates further exploration of useful specification media for repair of concurrency defects.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>The goal of the seminar was to promote cross fertilization among the verification, testing and repair communities, as they seem to be running into the same challenges, thereby solving increasingly similar problems. At the extreme, verification is about all possible program behaviors, testing is about running the program to see what it does, and repair is about generating new code.  However, many techniques in all communities now blur the distinction.  Use of dynamic information to guide abstractions in verification is one example; another is how predictive testing looks for bugs in possible executions close to a dynamic one, leading to a form of verification; finally, program repair increasingly uses solvers to synthesize new programs and test them, which overlaps with techniques from the other areas.  We intended for the seminar to bring out further areas in which these fields are closely related, and inspire further techniques that fuse these areas, which was fulfilled by some of the discussions throughout the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>Below are concrete examples of connections that we meant to expose, some of which were discussed throughout the seminar:\n</p> \n <h4>Benchmarks</h4> \n <p>Each area has a variety of benchmarks and competitions, and many of them ultimately focus on concurrency-specific challenges like interleavings.  It seems likely that the different communities could benefit from sharing.  For instance, predictive testing and verification could surely share many benchmarks, and a more standard set of benchmarks could make evaluations easier.  At the same time, potential users could help ensure that any benchmarks actually measure what they care about.\n</p> \n <h4>Infrastructure</h4> \n <p>Much progress in both testing and verification has been made possible by progress in solver technology, and a variety of solvers are now common in both areas.  There is room to share the infrastructure itself and the common remaining challenges.\n</p> \n <h4> Hybrid Tools</h4> \n <p>The path-specific focus of testing and the global focus of verification can aid each other, e.g. current work such as CLAP using a control flow from a specific execution to make model checking more scalable.\n</p> \n <p>Though the seminar touched on techniques and approaches that generalize beyond analysis and repair of concurrent software, we feel that the overall focus on challenges posed by concurrency was justified. With this focus, we were able to stir concrete discussion and tightly connected talks.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Julian Dolby, Orna Grumberg, Peter M\u00fcller, and Omer Tripp\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAutomated Planning and Scheduling (P&amp;S) and Robotics were strongly connected in the early days of A.I., but became mostly disconnected later on.\nIndeed, Robotics is one of the most appealing and natural application area for the P&amp;S research community, however such a natural interest seems to not be reflected by advances beyond the state-of-the-art in P&amp;S research in Robotics applications. In light of the accelerated progress and the growth of economic importance of advanced robotics technology, it is essential for the P&amp;S community to respond to the challenges that these applications pose and contribute to the advance of intelligent robotics.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this perspective, a Planning and Robotics (PlanRob) initiative within the P&amp;S research community has been recently started with a twofold aim. On the one hand, this initiative would constitute a fresh impulse for the P&amp;S community to develop its interests and efforts towards the Robotics research area. \nOn the other hand, it aims at attracting representatives from the Robotics community to discuss their challenges related to planning for autonomous robots (deliberative, reactive, continuous planning and execution etc.) as well as their expectations from the P&amp;S community.The PlanRob initiative was initiated as a workshop series (http://pst.istc.cnr.it/planrob/) started at \nthe International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) in 2013. The PlanRob workshop editions gathered very good feedback from both the P&amp;S and Robotics communities. And this resulted also in the organisation of a specific Robotics Track at ICAPS since 2014.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to reinforce such initiative and increase the synergy between these two research communities. Then, most of the attendees contributed with position statements (whose abstracts are available in this report) to present their major challenges and approaches for addressing them. In general, this involved sharing views, thoughts and contributions across the following main topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Long-term autonomy / Open world planning</b>, providing an overview on issues related to continuous planning for robots with partial information or even incomplete models;\n</li><li><b>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Planning</b>, with presentations on cognitive features and robot planning;\n</li><li><b>Challenges in Industrial, Logistics &amp; Consumer Robotics</b>, providing relevant insights related to deployment of robots in real world scenarios;\n</li><li><b>Human-Robot Planning</b>, with a wide overview on planning solutions for dealing with interactions between humans and robots;\n</li><li><b> Planning and Execution</b>, discussing issues and challenges related to robust planning and execution for robot control;\n</li><li><b> Motion Planning / Hybrid planners</b>, with presentations on integrated solutions for robot control at different levels;\n</li><li><b>Reliable and Safe Planning for Robotics</b>, providing an overview of ISO standards for robots and, more in general, investigating the exploitation of formal methods to guarantee reliability in robotic applications;\n</li><li><b>Technological Issues in Robot planning/Multi-robot Planning</b>, with statements on technological issues in (multi-) robot solutions.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nEach session was animated by (i) an opponent, whose role was to be critical about the position statements and (ii) a moderator, to organise the discussion. Therefore, opponents and moderators have provided a short summary of the session ideas and discussion in dedicated Synthesis Sessions to further foster the discussion.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition, two panel sessions have been organised on (i) <b>Evaluation, Benchmarking and Competitions</b>, discussing the experience in RoboCup@Home and the organisation of the new Planning and Execution competition (that will be held in 2017), and (ii) <b>Outreach &amp; Training</b>, discussing about the possible organisation of summer schools and the opening of new scientific networking initiatives (e.g., a COST action).\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, discussions focused on different issues, challenges, possible solutions and new promising trends over a very wide variety of relevant topics: knowledge representation, modelling issues, the need of incomplete models; cognitive features such as, for instance, learning and goal reasoning; human-aware solutions for flexible human-robot interaction; adaptive solutions for human-robot collaboration; robust execution capable of effectively dealing with failure; integration issues in robotic architecture that, e.g., exploit different kind of models and then perform hybrid reasoning; application of formal methods to provide verification and validation functionalities to guarantee reliable robotic systems; etc.\nIndeed, addressing the integration of P&amp;S and Robotics for development of intelligent robots entails covering a heterogeneous spectrum of problems, often requiring complex solutions that require a vast set of knowledge and technologies. \n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, there was a very high level of engagement and interaction between the participants, enabling a lively and productive week. The main outcome of the seminar was to share a common understanding of issues and solutions with thorough discussions. And the workshop ended with an open discussion on possible follow ups and possible actions to create further opportunities for fostering synergies and interactions between the two communities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andrea Orlandini and Malik Ghallab, Nick Hawes, Daniele Magazzeni, and Brian C.

            "data": "\n <h3>Computational Gemoetry</h3> \n <p>\nComputational geometry is concerned with the design, analysis, and\nimplementation of algorithms for geometric and topological problems,\nwhich arise naturally in a wide range of areas, including computer\ngraphics, CAD, robotics, computer vision, image processing, spatial\ndatabases, GIS, molecular biology, sensor networks, machine learning,\ndata mining, scientific computing, theoretical computer science, and\npure mathematics.  Computational geometry is a vibrant and mature\nfield of research, with several dedicated international conferences\nand journals and strong intellectual connections with other computing\nand mathematics disciplines.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Topics</h3> \n <p>The emphasis of the seminar was on presenting recent developments\nin computational geometry, as well as identifying new challenges,\nopportunities, and connections to other fields of computing.  In\naddition to the usual broad coverage of new results in the field, the\nseminar included broad survey talks on monitoring and shape data \nand on high-dimensional geometric computing, two focus areas that have\nseen exciting recent progress and that present numerous opportunities\nfor further cross-disciplinary impact.\n</p> \n <h4>Computational geometry for monitoring and shape data</h4> \n <p>\nThe combination of movement and geometry has always been an important\ntopic in computational geometry, initially motivated by robotics and\nresulting in the study of kinetic data structures.  With the advent of\nwidely available location tracking technologies such as GPS sensors,\ntrajectory analysis has become a topic in itself, which has connections to\nother classical topics in  computational geometry such as shape analysis.\nStill, efficient technologies to perform the most basic operations are\nlacking. We need data structures supporting similarity queries on\ntrajectory data and geometric clustering algorithms that can handle the\ninfinite-dimensional geometry inherent in the data.  A related type of\ndata, namely time series data, has not received much attention in the\ncomputational geometry community, despite its universality and its close\nrelation to trajectory data. Shedding light on the interconnections of\nthese topics will promote new results in the field which will address\nthese timely questions. \n</p> \n <h4>Computing in high-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces</h4> \n <p>The famous \"curse of dimensionality\" prevents exact geometric computations in\nhigh-dimensional spaces.  Most of the data in science and engineering is\nhigh-dimensional, rendering classical geometric techniques, such as the sweepline\napproach, insufficient.  One way to address this issue is to use sparsity, but\nit is not always easy to find a sparse representation of the data.  The search\nof the most efficient representation and how to exploit this representation\nleads to dimension-reduction techniques, metric embeddings, and approximation\nalgorithms.  This line of research has strong ties to machine learning and\ndiscrete mathematics as well as computational geometry.\n</p> \n <h4>Participants</h4> \n <p>Dagstuhl seminars on computational geometry have been organized in a two\nyear rhythm since a start in 1990. They have been extremely successful both in disseminating\nthe knowledge and identifying new research thrusts. Many major results in computational\ngeometry were first presented in Dagstuhl seminars, and interactions among the participants\nat these seminars have led to numerous new results in the field. These seminars have\nalso played an important role in bringing researchers together, fostering collaboration, and\nexposing young talent to the seniors of the field. They have arguably been the most influential\nmeetings in the field of computational geometry.\nThe organizers held a lottery for the third time this year; the lottery allows to create\nspace to invite younger researchers, rejuvenating the seminar, while keeping a large group of\nsenior and well-known scholars involved.  The seminar has now a more balanced\nattendance in terms of seniority and gender than in the past.\nThis year, 47 researchers from various countries and continents attended the seminar,\nshowing the strong interest of the community for this event. The feedback from participants\nwas very positive.\nNo other meeting in our field allows young researchers to meet with, get to know, and\nwork with well-known and senior scholars to the extent possible at the Dagstuhl Seminar.\nWe warmly thank the scientific, administrative and technical staff at Schloss Dagstuhl!\nDagstuhl allows people to really meet and socialize, providing them with a wonderful\natmosphere of a unique closed and pleasant environment, which is highly beneficial to\ninteractions. Therefore, Schloss Dagstuhl itself is a great strength of the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Otfried Cheong, Anne Driemel, and Jeff Erickson\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nMost big data sets are relational, containing a set of objects and relations between the objects. This is commonly modeled by graphs, with the objects as the vertices and the relations as the edges. A great deal is known about the structure and properties of special types of graphs, in particular <em>planar graphs</em> which are fundamental for both Graph Theory, Graph Algorithms and Automatic Layout. Structural properties of planar graphs can often be expressed, for example, in terms of excluded minors, low density, and small separators. These properties lead to efficient algorithms; consequently a number of fundamental algorithms for planar graphs have been discovered. As many of the characteristic properties of planar graphs have been generalized\n(e.g., graph minor theory, topological obstructions, chi-boundedness), these algorithms also extend in various directions to broad families of graphs.\n</p> \n <p>\nTypical real world graphs, such as social networks and biological networks, are <em>nonplanar</em>. In particular, the class of scale-free networks, which can be used to model web-graphs, social networks and many kinds of biological networks, are sparse nonplanar graphs, with globally sparse and locally dense structure. To analyze and visualize such real world networks, we need to formulate and solve fundamental mathematical and algorithmic research questions on <em>sparse nonplanar</em> graphs. Sparsity, in most cases, is explained by properties that generalize those of planar graphs: in terms of topological obstructions or forbidden intersection patterns among the edges. These are called <em>beyond-planar graphs</em>. Important beyond-planar graph classes include the following:\n</p> <ul>\n<li><em>k-planar graphs</em>: graphs that can be drawn with at most k crossings per edge;\n</li><li><em>k-quasi-planar graphs</em>: graphs which can be drawn without k mutually crossing edges;\n</li><li><em>k-gap-planar graphs</em>: graphs that admit a drawing in which each crossing is assigned to one of the two involved edges and each edge is assigned at most k of its crossings;\n</li><li><em>RAC (Right Angle Crossing) graphs</em>: graphs that have straight-line drawings in which any two crossing edges meet in a right angle;\n</li><li><em>bar k-visibility graphs</em>: graphs whose vertices are represented as horizontal segments (bars) and edges are represented as vertical lines connecting bars, intersecting at most k bars;\n</li><li><em>fan-crossing-free graphs</em>: graphs which can be drawn without fan-crossings; and\n</li><li><em>fan-planar graphs</em>: graphs which can be drawn such that every edge is crossed only by pairwise adjacent edges (fans).\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nCompared to the first edition of the seminar, we planned to focus more on aspects of computational geometry. Therefore, we included one new organizer as well as some more participants from this field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThirty-six participants met on Sunday afternoon for a first informal get-together and reunion since the last workshop which took place more than two years ago. From that event, the four working groups nearly all have completed and published subsequent work. We decided to build on the achievements of the previous meeting and scheduled short talks recalling the previous seminar's results. On Monday afternoon, we held an engaging open problems session and formed new working groups. Notably, this time,  more problems related to computational geometry as well as questions from combinatorics have been proposed. Open problems included questions about the combinatorial structures (e.g, book thickness, queue number), the topology (e.g., simultaneous embeddability, gap planarity, quasi-quasiplanarity), the geometric representations\n(e.g., representations on few segments or arcs), and applications\n(e.g., manipulation of graph drawings by untangling operations) of beyond-planar graphs. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the opening session of every morning, we have drawn inspiration from additional talks, fresh conference contributions on related topics (see abstracts).\nAn impressive session on the last day was devoted to progress reports that included plans for publications and follow-up projects among researchers that would have been highly unlikely without this seminar. From our personal impression and the feedback of the participants, the seminar has initiated collaboration and lead to new ideas and directions.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe thank all the people from Schloss Dagstuhl for providing a positive environment and hope to repeat this seminar, possibly with some new focus, for a third time.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Seok-Hee Hong, Michael Kaufmann, J\u00e1nos Pach, and Csaba D.

Despite the success of existing (Web) search technology, there are still many challenges and problems that need to be addressed.\nToday\u2019s Web search engines (often also powering domain-specific and site-specific search) are engineered and optimized to fulfil individual users\u2019 lookup tasks. This efficiency, however, also means that we largely view search systems as tools to satisfy immediate information needs, instead of rich environments in which humans heavily interact with information content, and search engines act as intelligent dialogue systems, facilitating the communication between users and content. Web search engines are not designed for complex search tasks that require exploration and learning, user collaborations and involve different information seeking stages and search strategies, despite the fact that more than a quarter of Web searches are complex.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of studying and designing search systems to foster discovery and enhance the learning experience during the search process outside of formal educational settings. Searches that lead to learning, are naturally complex. Research progress in this area, however, is slow, with many more open questions than answers. Several critical bottlenecks and major impediments to advancements in the search as learning area exist, including (i) the reliance on small-scale lab studies to evaluate novel approaches which severely limit the diversity of investigable factors as well as the ecological validity and generalizability of the findings; (ii) the lack of awareness among researchers\u2019 initiatives in this very multidisciplinary area of work; and (iii) the lack of a shared research infrastructure. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe 3-day seminar gathered 26 prominent researchers from the fields of information retrieval, psychology and the learning sciences in order to address the critical bottlenecks around search as learning. The seminar sessions alternated between tutorial-style presentations to learn from each other\u2019s disciplines and interactive breakout sessions to find a common ground and address the most pressing issues related to the four big research themes of (i) understanding search as a human learning process; (ii) the measurement of learning performance and learning outcomes during search; (iii) the relationship between the learning process and the search context; and (iv) the design of functionalities and search system interventions to promote learning.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                     Claudia Hauff, Kevyn Collins-Thompson, and Preben Hansen,\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\n<b>Background and motivation.</b> Since the seminal discovery of an efficient quantum integer factorization algorithm by Peter Shor in 1994, the field of Quantum Computation has blossomed into a large-scale international effort to build, test, and study the possibilities that information processing using quantum particles may provide. A central role in these developments has been played by Quantum Complexity Theory, a traditionally theoretical realm of research focusing on such questions as: Which physical properties of Nature can be efficiently computed? Can the behavior of an untrusted or noisy quantum computer be verified? What might constitute convincing evidence of \"quantum supremacy\" over classical computers?\n</p> \n <p>\nWith the first generation of completed \"Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)\" experiments already staking quantum supremacy claims, however, the answers to such \"traditionally theoretical\" questions have taken on an urgent and practical relevance. For example, a complexity theoretic understanding of which realistic physical problems are \"just hard enough\" for classical computers and \"easy enough\" for quantum computers is the natural starting point for \"quantum supremacy\" testbeds. With functioning experimental devices in place, one must next convincingly confirm the device is performing as designed, particularly in the presence of noise. Finally, if the aim of such experiments is to cast doubt on the Extended Church-Turing Thesis, then a strong standard of evidence is required; such a standard must be rigorously stated and developed.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Seminar Topics.</b> This seminar covered a range of topics under the broad umbrella of Quantum Complexity Theory, ranging from highly theoretical to experimentally driven.  We briefly overview some of these here; further examples and details are in the included talk abstracts.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Theoretical directions.</em> The field of Quantum Complexity Theory is concerned, broadly speaking, with a rigorous mathematical study of the resources required to perform certain computational tasks. To first order, this involves dividing the \"computational world\" into two buckets: Easy versus hard problems. However, in reality, the complexity landscape is much finer than this. For example, one might ask -- given that problem X has a known efficient quantum algorithm, does there nevertheless exist a <em>faster</em> quantum algorithm for X? This typically falls under the classical area of \"fine-grained complexity\", which has only recently begun to emerge as having a quantum analogue. Conversely, one may ask -- is problem $X$ hard only when one wishes to have a high precision answer, becoming easy when a larger margin of error is allowed? Classically, this falls under the umbrella of ``hardness of approximation'', and which has seen intense study in the guise of the ``quantum PCP conjecture''. Finally, given that quantum computers are believed more powerful than classical ones, a natural question is: <em>Do there exist computational problems whose difficulty lies strictly between classical and quantum?</em> Here, a natural object of study has been so-called \"stoquastic\" quantum systems, whose time evolution can often be simulated in practice via randomized (i.e. Monte Carlo) techniques, but which nevertheless appear difficult to classically simulate in the <em>worst case</em> in a rigorous fashion. Recent advances and the state of the art in all of these topics, as well as a number of others, were discussed at the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\n<em>Experimentally motivated directions.</em> The recent explosion of the so-called Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computation era has brought many new questions to the forefront of Quantum Complexity Theory.  For example, to date, two of the leading frameworks for experimental demonstration of \"quantum supremacy\" have been <em>random circuit sampling</em> and <em>Boson sampling</em>.  On the one hand, much progress has been made closing the remaining gaps in the theoretical hardness proofs for these tasks on classical computers. On the other hand, for experiments that <em>have</em> been conducted, important practical topics such as how to benchmark such experimental random circuit setups have very recently been studied. Moreover, beyond the quest for quantum supremacy lies the next question: <em>What practical applications might NISQ devices already prove useful for?</em> These and related topics were presented and discussed at the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Participants and program overview.</b> Due to the on-going COVID situation, the seminar was held in hybrid format. This meant that of the 55 total participants joining from 14 countries around the world (from North America to Europe to Asia), 17 were on-site, and 38 were remote. To allow all audience members to participate, a few measures were taken, which arguably worked quite well given the circumstances:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> During each of the seminar's on-site sessions, a Zoom session was projected onto a whiteboard, to which all remote participants were invited. The Zoom participants could see and hear on-site whiteboard and slide presentations, as well as interrupt to ask questions (via the room's loudspeaker system). This made for a reasonably efficient setup in which both on-site and hybrid participants could discuss in real-time. A Slack channel was also set up to ease communication, and by popular request, after talks a virtual Zoom chat room was set up so that the remote participants could also chat amongst themselves.\n\n</li><li> To accommodate both types of audience members, a mix of on-site and remote talks were scheduled. On-site talks were typically held in the morning (CEST), allowing remote audience members in Europe Asia to attend. These were held at \"standard\" times, starting at 9:00 CEST. Remote talks were largely scheduled in the late afternoon and evening (17:00 and 20:00 CEST), this time accessible to North American and European participants.\n\n</li><li> Seminar participants Marcel Hinsche (on-site) and James Watson (off-site) graciously offered to act as ``technical help volunteers'' for local and remote participants, ensuring the hybrid setup ran smoothly for both local and remote attendees.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nRegarding the remaining program structure, a strong emphasis was placed on plentiful open time for ad-hoc discussion - typically 14:00 to 17:00 was left open expressly for this purpose. A social outing (hike) was organized by participant Dominik Hangleiter on Wednesday afternoon, and a traditional social night in the music room took place on Wednesday evening.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Acknowledgements.</b> The seminar's participants and organizing committee wholeheartedly thank the Schloss Dagstuhl administrative and technical staff, who before, during, and after the seminar were incredibly supportive, professional, and patient with us quantum computer scientists. Many of the seminars participants, both online and off-line, commented very positively of the experience, citing it as a very welcome break to the stress of the on-going COVID pandemic.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Bill Fefferman, Sevag Gharibian, Norbert Schuch, and Barbara Terhal\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation</h3> \n <p>In recent years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data have begun to appear in many applications that are clinically relevant, such as resequencing of cancer patients, disease-gene discovery and diagnostics for rare diseases, microbiome analyses, and gene expression profiling, to name but a few. Other fields of biological research, such as phylogenomics, functional genomics, and metagenomics, are also making increasing use of the new sequencing technologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe analysis of sequencing data is demanding because of the enormous data volume and the need for fast turnaround time, accuracy, reproducibility, and data security. Addressing these issues requires expertise in a large variety of areas: algorithm design, high performance computing on big data (and hardware acceleration), statistical modeling and estimation, and specific domain knowledge for each medical problem. In this Dagstuhl Seminar we aimed at bringing together leading experts from both sides \u2013 computer scientists including theoreticians, algorithmicists and tool developers, as well as leading researchers who work primarily on the application side in the biomedical sector \u2013 to discuss the state-of-the art and to identify areas of research that might benefit from a joint effort of all the groups involved.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals of the seminar</h3> \n <p>The key goal of this seminar was a free and deep exchange of ideas and needs between the communities of algorithmicists and theoreticians and practitioners from the biomedical field. This exchange should have triggered discussions about  the implications that new types of data or experimental protocols have on the needed algorithms or data structures. \n</p> \n <h3>Results</h3> \n <p>\nWe started the seminar with a number of <em>challenge talks</em> to encourage discussion about the various topics introduced in the proposal. Before the seminar started we identified three areas the participants were most interested in, namely:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Data structures and algorithms for large data sets,  hardware acceleration\n</li><li> New problems in the upcoming age of genomes\n</li><li> Challenges arising from new experimental frontiers and validation\n</li></ol> \n <p>For the first area Laurent Mouchard, Gene Myers, and Simon Gog presented results and challenges; \nfor the second area Siavash Mirarab, Niko Beerenwinkel, Shibu Yooseph, and Kay Nieselt  introduced some thoughts; and finally, for the last area, Jason Chin, Ewan Birney, Alice McHardy, and Pascal Costanza talked about challenges. \nFor most of those talks the abstracts can be found below.\nFollowing this introductionary phase, the participants organized themselves into various working groups the topics of which were relatively broad. Those first breakout groups were about\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Haplotype phasing\n</li><li> Big data\n</li><li> Pangenomics data representation\n</li><li> Cancer genomics\n</li><li> Metagenomics\n</li><li> Assembly\n</li></ul> \n <p>The results of the groups were discussed in plenary sessions interleaved with some impromptu talks.\nAs a result the participants split up into smaller, more focused breakout groups that were received very well. Indeed, some participants did already extend data formats for assembly or improved recent results on full text string indices.\n</p> \n <p>\nBased on the initial feedback from the participants we think that the topic of the seminar was interesting and led to a lively exchange of ideas.  We thus intend to revisit the field in the coming years in a Dagstuhl seminar again, most likely organized by different leaders of the field in order to account for these upcoming changes. In such a seminar we intend to encourage more people from clinical bioinformatics to join into the discussions.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gene Myers, Mihai Pop, Knut Reinert, and Tandy Warnow\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Computational Geometry",
            "data": "\n <h3>Computational Geometry</h3> \n <p>\nThe field of computational geometry is concerned with the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms for geometric and topological problems, which arise naturally in a wide range of areas, including computer graphics, CAD, robotics, computer vision, image processing, spatial databases, GIS, molecular biology, sensor networks, machine learning, data mining, scientific computing, theoretical computer science, and pure mathematics. Computational geometry is a vibrant and mature field of research, with several dedicated international conferences and journals and strong intellectual connections with other computing and mathematics disciplines.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the early years mostly theoretical foundations of geometric algorithms were laid and fundamental research remains an important issue in the field. Meanwhile, as the field matured, researchers have started paying close attention to applications and implementations of geometric and topological algorithms. Several software libraries for geometric computation (e.g. leda, cgal, core) have been developed. Remarkably, this emphasis on applications and implementations has emerged from the originally theoretically oriented computational geometry community itself, so many researchers are concerned now with theoretical foundations as well as implementations. \n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Topics</h3> \n <p>\nThe emphasis of this seminar was on presenting recent developments in computational geometry, as well as identifying new challenges, opportunities, and connections to other fields of computing. In addition to the usual broad coverage of new results in the field, the seminar included broad survey talks on Computational Topology on Surfaces and Graphs as well as Combinatorial Complexity of Geometric Structures.\n</p> \n <h3>Computational Topology on Surfaces and Graphs</h3> \n <p>Computational topology has seen exciting advances in a number of topics. Indeed, best paper awards in several recent SoCGs went to papers on these topics. In 2019, Cohen-Addad et al. give a lower bound to a cutting problem in embedded graphs, essentially matching the running time of the fastest algorithm known and settling a 17-year old question. In 2018, Goaoc et al. proved that it is NP-complete to decide if a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex is shellable for $d geq 2$, resolving a question of Danaraj and Klee in 1978. In 2017, Despr\u00e9 and Lazarus presented simple quasi-linear algorithms for questions regarding geometric intersection number of a curve on a surface. Progress in these and related topics have had influences in problems on graphs embedded on surfaces, maximum flows and multiple-source shortest paths in planar graphs, collapsibility of simplicial complexes, metric learning, etc. \nThe seminar highlighted these topics with two overview talks.  The first by Hsien-Chih Chang was on Tightening Curves on Surfaces, and provided a overview of recent advancements in this area, and exciting directions for future work on flipping triangulations and morphing planar multicurves using electrical moves. \nThe second by Uli Wagner discussed Embeddability of Simplicial Compexes, and also the flurry of recent research in this area, and pinpointed the several remaining questions and where the community has not yet been able to resolve the embeddability and why the challenges remain.  \nThese talks, and other on recent advances, helped summarize the state of this area, and generate new avenues towards moving the field further forward.  \n</p> \n <h3>Combinatorial Complexity of Geometric Structures</h3> \n <p>The understanding of the combinatorial properties of geometric structures is at the core of computational geometry. A lot of these structures such as union of shapes, cuttings, arrangements, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram have found numerous applications in algorithm design. For example, the analysis of the complexity of the union of translates of a convex body allows us to understand the complexity of the free space in planning the motion of that convex body under translation. Their studies have also triggered the development of new theoretical tools such as the polynomial method that has been gaining a lot of attention lately. There are also new applications that require the modeling of uncertain data and hence call for a study of many geometric structures under a stochastic setting.\nThe seminar promoted these topics via two overview talks.  \nThe first overview talk was by Mikkel Abrahamsen on Minimum Fence Enclosure and Separation Problems; this line of work generalizes the notion of convex hull by identifies other minimally enclosing structures called fences, and the interesting combinatorial properties that arise.  \nThe second overview talk by Evanthia Papadopoulou was on Problems in Voronoi and Voronoi-like diagrams.  This talk discussed the advancement in generalizations of the classic geometric object of Voronoi diagrams to be defined among geometric objects beyond points, and to higher-order complexes.  \nIn addition to providing snapshots of these exciting subareas, they provided future directions for research within these topics and in how they can interact across the broader computational geometry landscape.  \n</p> \n <h3>Participants and Participation</h3> \n <p>\nDagstuhl seminars on computational geometry have been organized in a two year rhythm since a start in 1990. They have been extremely successful both in disseminating the knowledge and identifying new research thrusts. Many major results in computational geometry were first presented in Dagstuhl seminars, and interactions among the participants at these seminars have led to numerous new results in the field. These seminars have also played an important role in bringing researchers together, fostering collaboration, and exposing young talent to the seniors of the field and vice versa. They have arguably been the most influential meetings in the field of computational geometry. \nThe organizers held a lottery for the fifth time this year; the lottery allows to create space to invite younger researchers, rejuvenating the seminar, while keeping a large group of senior and well-known scholars involved. The seminar has now a more balanced attendance in terms of seniority and gender than in the past. This year, 36 researchers from various countries and continents attended the seminar, despite the virtual nature due to COVID-19, showing the strong interest of the community for this event. \n</p> \n <p>\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the seminar was held entirely virtually.  Talks were held over four days.  Each day had 2 two-hour blocks of talks, separated by a 2-hour meal break.  They were held in the late-afternoon and evening in Europe, which allowed for participants from North America to join in during their morning hours.  Unfortunately, this timing was late for those in Asia.  The talks were held on Zoom, a Slack server was set up for a more persistent text-based discussion, and a Wonder.me instance was arranged for dynamic forming of group discussions before and after each session.  All of these settings were used to communicate research, form collaborations, and attack open problems.  Although not as wonderful as actually being at Schloss Dagstuhl, these online mechanisms provided for a workable replacement for what a normal Dagstuhl seminar provides in this abnormal time.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThe feedback from participants was very positive.  The participants viewed the composition of the group positively, remarking how it was well-balanced in terms of seniority and gender.  They also praised the quality of the talks as of very high quality - making the virtual-only participation worthwhile.  \n</p> \n <p>\nWe warmly thank the scientific, administrative and technical staff at Schloss Dagstuhl!  Dagstuhl made virtual hosting possible and easy in a time filled with complications.  Despite not providing a physical space to meet, socialize, and collaborate, their help in organizing the event made it a success despite the less than ideal circumstances.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Siu-Wing Cheng, Anne Driemel, and Jeff M.

            "title": "Coalition Formation Games",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAs mentioned, coalition formation games occur in many real-world settings. We are particularly interested in a subclass of coalition formation games, hedonic games, which were first proposed by Dr\u00e8ze and Greenberg [1] and later formalized by Banerjee et al. [2] and Bogomolnaia and Jackson [3]. Hedonic games are distinguished from general coalition formation games by the requirement that each agent\u2019s utility is wholly derived from the members of their own coalition.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar brought multiple approaches and viewpoints to the study of\ncoalition formation games, and in particular hedonic games, mainly from the perspective of computer science and economics. Particular topics that were discussed in talks and working groups include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>succinctly representable preferences over coalitions;\n</li><li> evolving preferences;\n</li><li> the existence and verification of stable coalition structures (for various stability concepts);\n</li><li> the computational complexity of finding or verifying stable or optimal partitions, or even determining whether such partitions exist;\n</li><li>designing (if possible, efficient) algorithms for finding stable or optimal (or nearly so) coalition structures, or for verifying that a coalition structure is (nearly) stable or optimal;\n</li><li> stability notions restricted to social networks or other networks;\n</li><li> matching markets and matching under preferences, and their relation to hedonic games;\n</li><li> dynamics of coalition formation;\n</li><li> and group activity selection.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The overarching theme of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together different communities working in coalition formation and hedonic games from various perspectives in computer science and economics and to bridge and bundle their research activities.\n</p> \n <p>\nMuch of the great atmosphere of the seminars at Schloss Dagstuhl comes from informal meetings besides the official schedule, with participants doing leisure activities together and enjoying other joint undertakings - this is, by the way, coalition formation in practice. Owing to the hybrid mode and pandemic-related restrictions, it was unfortunately not possible for us to organize group activities with all participants. However, due to the great technical support at Schloss Dagstuhl, the participants - online and on site -  were able to take part in talks, discussions and working groups interactively to explore some of the challenging open questions of the field.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers thank all participants for interesting talks and discussions.\nWe also thank Schloss Dagstuhl for the technical preparation and support that made this hybrid seminar possible.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Dreze, Jacques H and Greenberg, Joseph.

            "data": "\n <p>\nA formal semantics is often intended as a tool to comprehend the behavior of a language or other system. Semanticists assume, for instance, that programmers can use a semantics to understand how a particular program will behave without being forced to resort to deconstructing the output from a black-box evaluator. Indeed, different semantic models vary in what aspects of program behavior they highlight and suppress.\n</p> \n <p>\nEvery semantics has an intended audience. Formal semantics typically assume a readership with high computing or mathematical sophistication. These therefore make them inappropriate for students new to computing. What forms of description of behavior would be useful to them? In computing education, the term <em>notional machine</em> is often used to refer to a behavior description that is accessibble to beginners.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur meeting therefore focused on what we know, and what we need to learn, about notional machines. In particular, we studied and discussed:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Different formulations of notional machines for a variety of languages.\n</li><li> The distinction between a general description of behavior, independent of a specific program, and the explication of behavior of a specific program. We argued for the value of having both the general and the specific, since learners might need to shift between the two.\n</li><li> The different forms that a notional machine can take, and their styles: [MARK fill in]\n</li><li> The many analogies employed in notional machines, with their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n</li><li> The different forms of theories that apply to generating and understanding notional machines, including cognitive and social.\n</li><li> Analogies to notional machines in other domains, from models in physics to rulebooks in board games.\n</li></ul> \n <p>We accomplished most of our stated goals: to bring together the semantics and education communities (though with much greater representation from the latter than the former); to create tutorials to educate each on the knowledge and methods of the other; and to formulate interesting examples. While there did not appear to be many long-standing \"open questions\", and there was not enough time to engage in editing Wikipedia, groups did organized community-wide activities (such as surveys to be conducted at upcoming conferences) and large banks of research questions (which are concrete and valuable outcomes that we had not anticipated). In sum, we believe the seminar successfully accomplished its overall stated goals.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mark Guzdial, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Juha Sorva, and Jan Vahrenhold\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Users and Automated Driving Systems: How Will We Interact with Tomorrow's Vehicles?",
            "data": "\n <p>\nFor much of the time since the invention of the automobile, human-machine interaction (HMI) in vehicles was reasonably clear: drivers controlled the vehicle by manipulating the steering wheel, pedals, and a few levers, buttons, or similar mechanical input devices [2]. They received information about the state of the vehicle through dials, warning lights, and sounds. And, they interacted with a relatively simple in-vehicle entertainment device: the\nradio, or perhaps the cassette- or CD player. \n</p> \n <p>\nIt is true that the number of input and output devices increased dramatically over the years - for example in the late 1950s, the Ford Edsel was described as a \u201cdevilish assemblage of gadgets\u201d [5]. The Edsel was soon out of production, but the number of gadgets kept climbing. It is also true that drivers sometimes operated the vehicle when they were tired, and fell asleep at the wheel. Other times they consumed too much alcohol, and were not able to safely control their vehicle. Yet, the basic concepts of human-machine interactions in the vehicle\nwere well-defined for research and development purposes. The driver\u2019s primary task was to drive: keep the vehicle on the road, avoid crashes, maneuver through traffic, and ultimately reach a destination. The driver also engaged in secondary tasks, such as manipulating the radio, as well as other non-driving-related tasks, such as talking to passengers, and eating. Creating good human-machine interfaces meant supporting the driver in these primary and\nsecondary tasks, while assuring safety for everyone on the road.\n</p> \n <p>\nThen, with the introduction of mobile computing devices, engagement in secondary tasks, such as talking to remote conversants, as well as sending text messages, and manipulating the interfaces of various mobile applications, became a significant issue in cars. In a sense these distractions were the same as those that drivers faced with the myriad buttons in the Ford Edsel. But, there were differences too: the Edsel did not allow the driver to communicate to remote conversants, nor did it have a touch-screen with ever-changing content. \n</p> \n <p>\nToday, we again find ourselves at a crossroads. Our cars have myriad buttons, as well as different mobile technologies, both for drivers and for passengers. But, additionally, the primary task of driving is often shared between the driver and the vehicle [9]. Most studies in distracted driving tend to focus on how non-driving activities serve as a distraction from the primary task of vehicle control. In the context of highly automated vehicles (HAV), driving\nwill be the distraction from non-driving activities [6]. Sometimes, the vehicle can effectively take over the driving task, and we can expect that this will become the norm rather than the exception in the foreseeable future: the driving task will be automated, at least on some road segments, and the driver will become a passenger. Yet, in this same foreseeable future we can also expect that the vehicle will sometimes hand the driving task back to the driver, who will have to transition back from the role of passenger to the role of the driver [14], [18]. This is the new landscape of in-vehicle human-machine interaction, and it presents a number of research questions that we addressed in this Dagstuhl seminar. In the rest of this report, we introduce pre-workshop tasks and summarize the activities and outcome of the seminar. Automated traffic is a challenge not limited to the interaction between a human driver and an automated vehicle. Automated vehicles will be part of a mixed traffic with other traffic participants of less or no automation. Also further traffic participants such as pedestrian and bicycles are part of this and requires a certain level of communication and recognition of the vehicles intention and actions among vehicles and the surrounding traffic participants.\n</p> \n <h3>Research questions tackled in Dagstuhl seminar 19132</h3> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Handover:</b> One of the key questions in designing in-vehicle human-machine interaction for partially automated vehicles is, how can the vehicle safely hand back the task of controlling the vehicle to the driver. In the short term this is one of the most important questions for those designing vehicles with automation, because in the short term such vehicles will have to hand control back to the driver relatively often [14], [15]. We need to\nunderstand how the modality, conveyed information, and reliability of take-over requests (TORs), engagement in non-driving tasks, and motion perception can influence drivers performance in task switching in highly automated driving context [6].\n</li><li><b> Trust:</b> Drivers must trust the automation features in order to take advantage of them [19]. We need to individually understand the trust in the individual actions of the vehicle starting out from assistance systems [21] to more automated functions [13], [20].\n</li><li><b> Creating a place for work and play:</b> One important benefit of automation would be that drivers can become passengers, and thus use the time in the vehicle to either be productive (work), or relax (play). How can human-machine interaction for automated vehicles be designed, such that drivers can take advantage of their newfound freedom from driving [9], [12]? How can we do this, taking into account the physical and computational characteristics of the vehicle, as well as the potential for motion sickness?\n</li><li><b>Communication between all traffic participants:</b> With the advent of automation, the transportation environment will include partially and fully automated vehicles. Yet, manually driven vehicles will remain for the foreseeable future, as will pedestrians, bicyclists, and other transportation users. For safe driving, all of these transportation users will have to communicate, but it is not yet clear how this can best be accomplished [16].\n</li><li><b> Advanced technologies for in-vehicle HMI:</b> The technologies that are available for human-machine interaction are continuously improving. Two exciting technologies that will be worth examining in the context of automated vehicles are speech interaction (e. g.[8]), and augmented reality e. g. [11] and [10].\n</li><li><b> Legal aspects of in-vehicle interfaces:</b> Automation, as well as the user interfaces built for partially and fully automated vehicles, will have to fit into the legal structures of the countries where the vehicles are used [7]. What are these structures, what do designers need to know about them, and how can they help develop the future legal structures?\n</li></ol> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Ingrid Pettersson, Florian Lachner, Anna-Katharina Frison, Andreas Riener, and Andreas Butz.

            "title": "Anticipatory Human-Machine Interaction",
            "data": "\n <p>There is growing interest in interdisciplinary understanding of the anticipatory processes regarding other people's actions and also one's own actions.  \nThis surge in interest is especially important given that anticipatory interaction is needed in the growing area of intelligent systems that work closely together with human partners.\nDecades of research on human-machine interaction (HMI) have resulted in significant advances in theories, tools, and methods to facilitate, support, and enhance interactions between humans and computing systems. \nDespite the fundamental importance of HMI for our information society and numerous advances towards making interactions with machines more human-like, current systems still fall short in one core human ability - Theory of Mind (ToM). \nToM allows us to attribute mental states to others and anticipate their actions; and is thus essential for us to interact naturally, effortlessly, and seamlessly.  \n</p> \n <p>\nToM shapes how we interact with each other and is most easily observable in physical tasks, such as moving a table together.\nIn this scenario, we rely on ToM abilities to attribute intentions to others and in turn, continuously adapt our own behaviour to accommodate the intentions of others, resulting in seamless collaboration. \nToM begins to develop in early childhood. Even small children who are not able to develop the full cognitive ability of ToM can anticipate others' intentions using simple mental models of tasks and following familiar sequences of actions (e.g. Fiebich, 2018).\n</p> \n <p>\nDeficits in ToM are closely linked to developmental disorders, such as autism, and current machines are similarly mind-blind.\nThat is, they fail to sense users' attention and predict their intentions, and therefore lack the ability to anticipate and pro-actively adapt to users' actions. \nThis limits machines to operating after the fact, i.e. to merely react to user input. \nThis fundamentally limits the naturalness, efficiency, and user experience of current interactions.\nImagine how difficult it would be to move a table with a robot: as the robot cannot anticipate easy and hard actions for the user (e.g., the table is heavy and needs to be rested for a moment, a corner has to be navigated for which the user has to switch her grip, etc.), it would not be a very helpful teammate.\nWe believe anticipatory HMI has significant potential to bring systems that possess ToM to a new, exciting level of development.\nHowever, the building blocks required for anticipatory HMI are still at a very early research stage.\nThis is in stark contrast to the large body of work on (Computational) Theory of Mind in the cognitive and neurosciences and the variety of potential applications in which artificial anticipatory behaviour could have a revolutionary and paradigm-changing influence.\n</p> \n <p>\nWith this seminar we have made a first step in bridging this gap and have discussed theoretical foundations, key research challenges and opportunities, new computational methods, as well as applications and use cases of anticipatory HMI.\nResearch on anticipatory HMI is inherently interdisciplinary and draws from a number of fields, most notably human-computer interaction, machine learning, computer vision, computational neuroscience, computational cognitive science, privacy and security, as well as context-aware computing.\nConsequently, in this seminar, we have brought together junior and established researchers within these communities for the first time to explore the scientific foundations of anticipatory HMI.\n</p> \n <h3>Three perspectives on human-machine anticipation</h3> \n <p>\nIn the seminar we have discussed three perspectives on human-machine anticipation.</p> \n <p><b>Anticipating the intentions, beliefs, mental states and next actions of the user.</b> This perspective focuses on the challenges, as well as possible solutions, for machine anticipation of user intentions, goals, motivations, and behaviors. This includes the underlying question of which mental states need to be modeled and anticipated in the first place. This might be different depending on the purpose of the collaboration or on the specific circumstances.\n</p> \n <p><b>Anticipating the outcome of the machine's own actions.</b> The ability of a machine to anticipate its own actions and outcomes is important, especially for interaction in teams and for learning purposes. Artificial agents need to have a concept of the outcome of their own actions, as that will naturally affect the collaboration with the human or other agents. In addition, in case the expected outcome of an action is not reached, they have to learn how they can achieve the expected outcome in an alternative manner.\n</p> \n <p><b>Anticipating the outcome of collaborative work and human-machine teaming.</b> The third perspective builds on the previous two. In human-machine teaming, a machine needs to anticipate the human partners' actions, identify problems, and develop ideas on how the partners in a team can be supported. We will discuss how artificial agents can engage in effective teamwork with humans and which specific abilities are required. We will also discuss whether we can construct artificial agents that behave indistinguishable from human agents \u2013 and whether this is even desirable.\n</p> \n <h3>Underlying concepts and methods</h3> \n <p>\nIn addition to the three different perspectives on anticipatory behaviour, we have discussed the underlying concepts and computational methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the conceptual side, we have discussed definitions and developed a common language. \nThis included, for example, concepts such as cognitive state vs. mental states (which are not always concisely defined across disciplines). \nFurthermore, to support our cross-disciplined, multi-context approach, we have collected different forms and definitions of \"anticipation''.\nA related but separate concept that we have discussed is what different disciplines understand by ToM and what related terms that should be differentiated?.\nWe found that there are considerable differences of opinion on this that we formulated and exchanged.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the methodological side, we have discussed the ways in which different domains and disciplines have their own methods, approaches, and challenges.\nSubsequently, groups have exchanged and discussed these collections to gain a deeper understanding of available methodological approaches.\nWe have also talked about current approaches in modelling and cognitive science, and exchange ideas with those of us from other disciplines. \nWhich approaches support the development of better applications?\nMore general is the question how user behaviour can be measured. \nWhat data can or should be collected (CV, natural language, neurobiological measures, behavior,..), how can we process it most effectively, and how can we incorporate it into cognitive or computational models of the other users? \nFinally, we have discussed what the best way is to integrate and fuse different sources of information about the user, and how this can be integrated with the current context.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jelmer Borst, Andreas Bulling, Cleotilde Gonzalez, and Nele Ru\u00dfwinkel\n                </div> \n",

The focus of this seminar was on deployed schemes and more mature post-quantum cryptographic schemes, such as Round~3 candidates in NIST's standardization effort. For the technical program of the seminar, we encouraged research on\n</p> \n <p><b>Quantum algorithmic innovations</b> to attack cryptographic building blocks, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum computing.\nHow can we leverage quantum algorithms to improve cryptanalytic capabilities, and how can we optimize the best available cryptanalytic results in meaningful quantum attack models?\n</p> \n <p><b>echniques and software tools</b> to optimize and quantify resources for such attacks. Can we establish reasonably precise quantum resource counts for cryptanalytic attacks, especially for problem instances and parameter choices that are actually deployed or considered for standardization for future deployment?\n</p> \n <p>\nQuantum attacks against today's RSA or elliptic-curve based cryptography and against modern block ciphers, which help us understand the urgency for transitioning to post-quantum solutions, fall in the seminar scope. As in the past, the seminar brought together researchers who work in the field of quantum computing with experts in classical cryptography, taking into account the latest advances in both fields. With 26 participants on site and 29 remote participants, Schloss Dagstuhl hosted a broad group of leading experts from across the globe.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization</h3> \n <p>\nThe ongoing pandemic impacted the organization of the seminar, which for the first time was offered in a hybrid format. Thanks to the available technology at Schloss Dagstuhl and the efficient support of two volunteers (Shaun Kepley and Galina Pass), integrating remote presentations into the schedule worked smoothly.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe scheduling accounted for time zone differences and, as in the past, we left ample time for discussions and collaboration -- for a typical day, we scheduled no more than four presentations. Following the Dagstuhl tradition and in line with prior seminars in the Quantum Cryptanalysis series, there was no technical program during Wednesday afternoon, leaving participants time for exploring the surroundings, spending time on research, or taking care of testing requirements for upcoming international travel. \n</p> \n <h3>Results and next steps</h3> \n <p>The collaboration between cryptographers and experts in quantum computing has come a long way, and it seems fair to say that this Dagstuhl Seminar series has contributed to this positive development. The quantum cryptanalytic progress in symmetric cryptography is very noticeable. This was evidenced by the number and quality of presentations on this subject offered by seminar participants. On the asymmetric side, the presentations demonstrated fascinating research progress on understanding computational problems related to lattices and codes. At the same time, a need remains to better quantify the potential of quantum algorithms for tackling hardness assumptions as used in state-of-the-art post-quantum proposals.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Stacey Jeffery, Michele Mosca, Maria Naya-Plasencia, and Rainer Steinwandt\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Visual Analytics of Multilayer Networks Across Disciplines",
            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nThe topic of multilayer networks has recently emerged from the field of complex systems, however many of the of the fundamental concepts and ideas have existed  for some time, in fields such as sociology, and often under different nomenclature, such as multimodal, heterogeneous or multiplex networks. \nThe multilayer network framework of Kivel\u00e4 <em>et al</em> [1] has collected many of these concepts and different labels, along with example data sets, allowing us to recognize the multi-disciplinary importance of multilayer networks as a topic.\nDespite the importance of this topic, it is only recently that the visualization community is beginning to consider approaches for the visual analytics of multilayer networks.\nThis seminar was the first to bring together practitioners from multiple domains to discuss the visual analytics of multilayer networks. These fields included data visualization, complex systems, digital humanities, biological sciences, health informatics,  and sociology. \nThe primary goal of this seminar was to bring together these thinkers and practitioners from different disciplines to drive forward new advances on the topic.\nThe seminar was designed to  foster discussions between researchers and designers of visual analytics tools, those who define the underlying theory, and the the end-users of these tools. \nTo push research further and produce significant impact in industry and general public practices, the research community needs to establish a deeper collaboration between data scientists and researchers from applications domains (e.g. biologists, social scientists, business analysts, journalists, physicists), who collect and analyze the data; and researchers in maths, physics and computer science who push the state-of-the-art, producing visualization and analysis models, algorithms and tools. This deeper collaboration starts with building an understanding of the needs and tasks of network analysts.\nThis seminar was an important first step, leveraging cross domain synergies with the goal of identifying the shared underlying problems and helping to solve them.  The domain experts presented  their domain problems early on in the seminar, and then interacted with two different sets of visualization experts in two separate breakout sessions. The motivation for this was to expose the visualization experts to many different domain problems and to expose the domain experts to multiple approaches to their problems. \nOur goal was to not only to advance research in the field of visualization, but also to provide techniques to help the domain experts to advance research in their own field. Interdisciplinary intersection was a key part of the methodology of our seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Topics</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar featured talks and working groups that discussed topics on visualization, analysis, theory and applications of multilayer networks (see Sections 3 and 4).\nThe application domain focus was maintained throughout the seminar. Experts from application domains gave talks in the first day and a half highlighting the problems they encountered. Then there were two breakout sessions where each experts was assigned a different group of visualization experts, allowing the domain experts to brainstorm solutions to their problems with different sets of visualization experts.\n</p> \n <h4>Talks</h4> \n <p>The talks brought the interdisciplinary participants initial information on a) current application problems dealt with in the area of multilayer networks and b) current visualization, analysis and systems solutions. \n\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of talks by application experts was to make sure that the potential solutions provided by the interactive visualizations and analytics fully meet the requirements of those who actually use them, i.e. the system biologists, social network analysts, historians, etc. Therefore, the talks provided understanding of the data and problems/tasks/goals when analyzing multilayer graphs by the domain experts. The talks covered application areas of social networks by A. Cottica and by M. Magnani, information circulation in an international organization by M. Grandjean, digital humanities by M. D\u00fcring , multi-omics data by S. Legay, population health by M. McCann, digital ethnography by A. Munk(see sections 3).\nThese talks allowed the visualizations and complex systems theory experts to gain some insight into the domain experts problems.  \nAs we also wanted the domain experts to be exposed to multiple approaches to their problems, we had two breakout sessions after all of the domain experts presented their personal topics.\nIn these breakout sessions, each domain experts was assigned a small group of visualization researchers to further brainstorm, mapping visualization problems to domain problems. Different researchers were assigned to each domain expert for each session. This exposed the domain experts to multiple visualization approaches, and allowed for synergies between application domain problems to be identified by the visualization researchers.\nAt the end of each breakout session, each groups gave a short report back to other participants, allowing for further discussion and cross fertilization of ideas.\nThis approach ensured that that both the domain experts and the visualization experts had a wide range of ideas to explore as part of the working groups in the later half of the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of talks by visualization, analysis and systems experts was to present currently available solutions to multilayer network visualization and analysis (see also Section 3). These talks were dispersed throughout out the week. The talk topics were: an introduction to multilayer networks by F. McGee, a complex systems perspective on the concept of multilayer network by M. Kivel\u00e4, survey of multilayer visualizations by G. Melancon, Py3plex library for visualization by B. Skrlj, interaction with multilayer network visualization by B. Renoust. This allowed application experts to get to know the advantages and limitations of existing solutions. The talk schedule was flexible, for example, due to a high level of interest form all attendees M. Kivel\u00e4 gave a second question and answers session to his talk the following day.\n</p> \n <h4>Working Groups</h4> \n <p>At the midpoint of the week we defined the working groups.\nThe breakout session stimulated a large amount of discussion and ideas across participants of all disciplines.\nFollowing on the breakout sessions discussions, all seminar participants wrote down topics and ideas that were that were of interest to them of pieces of paper, which were affixed to a board.  Similar topics were re-positioned closer together on the board,  until all participants reached a consensus of five topic areas for discussion within working groups.\nThe resulting working groups were as follows:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><i>Unifying Terminology and visual analytic approaches</i>: One open problem of multilayer network analysis and visualization is the inconsistent terminology across disciplines. There are many different names given to networks with such characteristics, outlining the current lack of consistent definitions between disciplines, such as heterogeneous, multi-faceted, multi-modal, or multi-relational networks, amongst others (see [1]) and in the vast majority of cases it is possible to model them as multilayer networks. The\ndiscussion group assessed various types of networks from visualization,  application and systems perspective. It discussed possible unification of these perspectives in one visual analytics framework and identified open challenges (see Section 4.3).\n</li><li><i>Analytics, Communities Comparison and attributes</i>: Visual analysis of multilayer networks is also concerned with the exhibition of salient properties and patterns in data. Salience in networks is often captured through metrics (networks statistics) while patterns most often correspond to particular subsets of entities (nodes and edges). Layers bring additional complexity to the computation of these metrics and patterns, as metrics and patterns may\nneed to be computed across several layers. The visualization of the computed metrics and patterns needs to consider also these layers, thus, posing challenges to the data presentation. This working group analyzed the current network metrics and proposed novel metrics specifically for multilayer networks (see Section 4.4).\n</li><li><i>Interaction (and Layer Creation)</i>: (see Section 4.2) This topic concentrated on interactive creation of layers in networks. While the input multilayer network may have predefined layers, in many use cases, the layers need to be adapted to the analytical task during network exploration. This working group has gathered requirements for interaction with layers, surveyed current solutions and their limitations. They have proposed novel approaches that will be pursued after the seminar. \n</li><li><i>Visual Encodings</i> The complex relationships between complex structures mean that traditional interactive visualizations need to be enhanced. Researchers from the various domains can exchange their ideas and thus start novel avenues in interactive visualization.\nThe discussion of this working group focused on the visualization design \u2013 encodings. The group identified main requirements for visualization: aggregations, interactive layer editing, overview of all layers, details of an individual layer and exploration paths \u2013 top-down versus bottom up (see Section 4.5). These requirements are used to derive a design space of possible visualization approaches in future.\n</li><li><i>Human Factors and Multilayer Networks</i> This topic focused on the user\u2019s point of view in the design of multilayer network visualization. This is a challenge as the complexity of multilayer networks results in a significant amount of cognitive load on the users. The group collected results from related work that can be used as guidelines for designing multilayer visualizations. It also identified gaps in literature for future research (see Section 4.1).\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Seminar Outcomes</h3> \n <p>During the seminar, a number of sub-topics were identified that require further research: <em>A unifying visualization framework</em>, <em>Novel Visual Encodings</em>, <em>Analytics</em> and <em>Attributes, Interaction, Evaluation, Use Cases</em>, and <em>Human Factors</em>.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>A unifying visualization framework for multilayer networks:</b>\nCurrently, multilayer networks are referred to across communities using various names and concepts. A novel unified conceptual framework for multilayer network is needed that  would be used for visualization, interaction and analytics purposes. It should extend the underlying mathematical framework [1] to meet the needs of the data and tasks associated with the various use cases, as well as existing visualization and interaction concepts.\n</li><li><b>Novel visual encodings:</b> The existing visualization techniques have limited scope for the broad range of data and tasks in the applications of multilayer networks. Therefore, novel visual encodings need to be researched that to enable data exploration across layers. \n</li><li><b>Interaction</b>: Visual exploration and analysis of multilayer networks requires novel interaction techniques that would allow to browse across layers and also to create new layers during the exploration process.\n\n</li><li><b>Interdisciplinarity:</b> The wide range of application domain problems sets novel problems that may be best addressed by new visualization approaches. The development of novel solutions for visual analysis of multilayer networks requires joined forces of application, visualization and analysis experts. \n\n</li><li><b>Multiple layers and attributes:</b> The complexity of multilayer networks often includes an additional dimension: The multivariate nature of node and edge attributes. This information needs to be encoded in the visualization and supported in analytical functions. This raises novel challenges.\n</li><li><b>Network Analytics:</b> Visual network analysis also covers the understanding the analytical relationship between layers (with respect to structure and/or attributes) and the layer comparison. The limitations of current analytical approaches and network metrics raises many interesting challenges and opportunities for developing new metrics for the multilayer use case.\n</li><li><b>Evaluation &amp; Human Factors:</b>\nThe human perspective on the complexity of the network structure and its visualization needs to be assessed. It covers a) the perceptual and cognitive aspects when interactively exploring the networks and b) a thorough empirical evaluation of the analytical paths and insights. The existing methodologies for such research should be adapted for the multilayer network case.\n</li></ul> \n <p>These topics will be discussed in the follow-up VIS 2019 Workshop \"Challenges in Multilayer Network Visualization and Analysis\". The workshop is co-organized by Dagstuhl Seminar organizers and participants: Fintan McGee, Tatiana von Landesberger, Daniel Archambault and Mohammad Ghoniem. The seminar will feature keynote, paper and poster sessions as well as discussion rounds on the above-mentioned topics. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Mikko Kivel\u00e4 and Alex Arenas and Marc Barthelemy and James P.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe explosion of <em>big data</em> applications imposes severe challenges of data processing speed and scalability on traditional computer systems. However, the performance of von Neumann architecture is greatly hindered by the increasing performance gap between CPU and memory, motivating active research on new or alternative computing architectures. Neuromorphic computing systems, that refer to the computing architecture inspired by the working mechanism of human brains, have gained considerable attention. The human neocortex system naturally possesses a massively parallel architecture with closely coupled memory and computing as well as unique analog domain operations. By imitating this structure, neuromorphic computing systems are anticipated to be superior to conventional computer systems across various application areas. In the past few years, extensive research studies have been performed on developing large-scale neuromorphic systems. Examples include IBM's TrueNorth chip, the SpiNNaker machine of the EU Human Brain Project, the BrainScaleS neuromorphic system developed at the University of Heidelberg, Intel's Loihi etc. These attempts still fall short of our expectation on energy-efficient neuromorphic computing systems with online, real-time learning and inference capability. The bottlenecks of computation requirements, memory latency, and communication overhead continue to be showstoppers. Moreover, there is a lack of support in design automation of neuromorphic systems, including functionality verification, robustness evaluation and chip testing and debugging. Hardware innovation and electronic design automation (EDA) tools are required to enable energy-efficient and reliable hardware implementation for machine intelligence on cloud servers for extremely high performance as well as edge devices with severe power and area constraints.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of the seminar was to bring together experts from different areas in order to present and to develop new ideas and concepts for emerging hardware techniques and EDA methodologies for neuromorphic computing. \nTopics that were discussed included:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Neuroscience basics \n</li><li> Physical fundamentals\n</li><li> New devices and device modeling\n</li><li> Circuit design and logic synthesis\n</li><li> Architectural innovations\n</li><li> Neurosynaptic processor and system integration\n</li><li> Design automation techniques\n</li><li> Simulation and emulation of neuromorphic systems\n</li><li> Reliability and robustness\n</li><li> Efficiency and scalability\n</li><li> Hardware/software co-design\n</li><li> Applications\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar facilitated greater interdisciplinary interactions between physicists, chip designers, architects, system engineers, and computer scientists.\nHigh-quality presentations and lively discussions were ensured by inviting carefully selected experts who participated in the seminar. \nAll of them have established stellar reputations in the respective domains. \nAs a result, we developed a better understanding of the respective areas, generated impetus for new research directions, and ideas for areas that will heavily influence research in the domain of neuromorphic design over the next years.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the end of the seminar, we identified the following four areas as being among the most important topics for future research: <em>computing-in-memory</em>, <em>brain-inspired design and architecture</em>, <em>new technologies and devices</em>, and <em>reliability and robustness</em>.  \nThese research topics are certainly not restricted to and cannot be solved within one single domain. It is therefore imperative to foster interactions and collaborations across different areas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Hai Li\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>\nThe Internet was originally developed to ease collaboration between remote parties, thereby, in principle, reducing carbon emissions by a reduced need for travel. Yet, conducting research on communication networks has typically involved a certain level of carbon footprint. One fundamental reason is the publication and dissemination culture in the field, which focuses on conferences and workshops rather than journals. Not only does every dissemination of a research result therefore involves travel, even the peer-review process to decide which papers to accept, in the form of an in-person technical program committee (TPC) meeting, also requires travel. Moreover, although the standardization of Internet technology within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) largely involves online discussions and audio/video streaming--unlike almost all other standardization bodies-yet regular in-person meetings are considered critical to converge discussion and build consensus. Thus, conducting and disseminating networking research has resulted in a high level of travel, and a consequent high carbon footprint.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe carbon footprint of these trips (mostly air travel) can, however, be reduced by means of organizational changes and virtual conferences. Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have already witnessed a rapid transition to a virtual mode of operation including remote working, online meetings, and virtual conferences. This has resulted in first-hand experience in carrying out research but with no travel.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this Dagstuhl Seminar, we initiated a discussion on how to make Internet research more climate friendly. Specifically, we evaluated experiences in running and participating in virtual conferences as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to understand what went well and what went badly in implementing and deploying virtual conferences, what challenges were encountered, and what needs to be improved, particularly as we transition to hybrid in-person, online meetings. The broader goal of the seminar is to identify how to transition to a new status quo that continues to reduce the carbon footprint from travel. \n</p> \n <h3>Structure</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar lasted 2.5 days. It began with an introductory round\nwhere each participant presented one slide to give an overview of their\nexperience that was relevant for the seminar and a set of open questions that\nthe participant wished to discuss during the event. These slides were\ncollected from each participant before the seminar. We also had one invited talk that we used as a basis for triggering discussions and identifying areas for group work, while a major portion of the seminar time was dedicated to breakout sessions, whereby participants were split into small groups to discuss specific themes and develop ideas with consensus to propose to larger groups. The morning sessions the following day were dedicated to continuing parallel group work with presentations that reported the outcomes of each breakout session from the previous day. Every evening, we had an online social activity. The afternoon of the third day was spent reviewing and collecting feedback from the participants and for initiating follow up actions identified during the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Vaibhav Bajpai, Jon Crowcroft, Oliver Hohlfeld, and Srinivasan Keshav\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis 5-day Seminar built on the  previous Dagstuhl Seminar 16241 together with several intervening workshops on graph polynomials, particularly those associated with William Tutte's Centenary, to advance an emerging comparative theory for graph polynomials.  Graph polynomials have played a key role  in combinatorics and its applications, having effected breakthroughs in conceptual understanding and brought together different strands of scientific thought. For example, the characteristic and matching polynomials advanced graph-theoretical techniques in chemistry; and the Tutte polynomial married combinatorics and statistical physics, and helped resolve long-standing problems in knot theory. The area of graph polynomials is  incredibly active, with new applications and new graph polynomials being discovered each year. However, the resulting plethora of techniques and results urgently requires synthesis. Beyond catalogues and classifications we need a comparative theory and unified approaches to streamline proofs and deepen understanding. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe Seminar provided a space for the  cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in graph theory, algebraic graph theory, topological graph theory, computational complexity, logic and finite model theory, and biocomputing and statistical mechanics applications.  There is a long history in this area of results in one field leading to breakthroughs in another when techniques are transferred, and this workshop  leveraged that paradigm. More critically, experts in the field have recently begun noticing strong resonances in both results and proof techniques among the various polynomials. The species and genera of graph polynomials are diverse, but there are strong interconnections: in this seminar we worked towards a general theory that brings them together under one family.  The process of developing such a theory of graph polynomials exposes deeper connections, giving great impetus to both theory and applications. This has immense and exciting potential for all those fields of science where combinatorial information needs to be extracted and interpreted.\n</p> \n <p>The seminar was roughly organized according to the following themes:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Unification:</b> General frameworks for graph polynomials including  meta-problems, K-theory, Second Order Logic, and Hopf algebras.\n</li><li><b>Generalizations:</b> Polynomial invariants for graphs with added structure (e.g. digraphs, ribbon graphs) or  more general \"underlying\" combinatorial structures (e.g. matroids, Delta-matroids).\n</li><li><b>Distinction:</b> Distinguishing power of graph invariants (equivalence and uniqueness up to isomorphism with respect to a given graph polynomial, interrelations among graph polynomials, properties of graph polynomials).\n</li><li><b>Applications:</b> Applications of graph polynomials in other disciplines (e.g. self-assembly, sequencing, quantum walks, statistical mechanics, knot theory, quantum Ising model).  \n</li><li><b>Conjectures:</b> Breakthrough conjectures (outstanding open problems whose resolution would have a broad impact on the understanding of graph polynomials). \n</li><li><b>Complexity:</b> Computational complexity and computational methods.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jo Ellis-Monaghan, Andrew Goodall, Iain Moffatt, and Kerri Morgan\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Programmable Network Data Planes",
            "data": "\n <p>\nTraditional networks are complex and hard to manage. It is difficult to configure networks according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure them in response to dynamic changes. Traditional networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Around 10 years ago, the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm emerged and began to change this state of affairs. SDN breaks the vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches (by means of a protocol such as OpenFlow) and promoting the (logical) centralization of network control. As such, it enabled the introduction of new abstractions in networking giving the ability to program the control plane of networks. Modern data center networks employ SDN-based techniques to simplify network management and operate at very large scale, and new networking services are now made possible - prominent examples are VMware's Network Virtualization Platform, Google's Andromeda and Microsoft's AccelNet.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite offering programmatic control to network operators, the original SDN data plane was limited to the protocols supported by OpenFlow. Over time, the OpenFlow specification evolved to support operator requirements, growing from 12 header fields in the original version to nearly 50 protocols in recent versions. The primary reason that OpenFlow is limited to specific \"baked in\" protocols is that the capabilities of switching chips are fixed at fabrication time. However, recent chip designs have demonstrated that it is possible to increase the flexibility of switch ASICs while still maintaining the terabit speeds required of networking hardware. In addition, as programming these chips is difficult - they expose their own low-level interface, akin to microcode programming - a domain-specific language, P4, was recently proposed to program network data planes (see p4.org). These advances are leading to a growing understanding of the inherent challenges related to data plane programming, resulting in further changes that promote future advances. For example, P4 was originally based on a simple architectural model, but has evolved to allow different switch architectures, aiming for stability of the language while increasing the flexibility to switch designers.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the same time as programmable switches and programming languages such as P4 were being developed, a different group of researchers within the networking community has explored an alternative approach in which advanced data plane functionality is implemented on end hosts. This approach is often known as Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Platforms such as OpenVSwitch and Intel's DPDK framework make it possible to implement sophisticated packet-processing functions on end hosts rather than network switches, at line rates up to 10Gb/s and beyond. A key advantage of using CPUs is their flexibility, which makes it easy to adapt as requirements evolve. For example, it is straightforward to implement fine-grained monitoring of network flows or cryptographic operations - two pieces of functionality that are difficult to implement on standard switch ASICs.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this context, the seminar on programmable data planes brought together leading practitioners from the areas of networking, systems, programming languages, verification, and hardware, to exchange ideas about important problems and possible solutions, and to begin the task of developing a research agenda related to programmable data planes. We have discussed several topics, including data plane architectures; programming languages, compilers and targets; use cases and applications; verification tools and formal methods; and end-system issues.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the seminar we discussed questions including where packet-processing functionality should reside, how programmable data planes should evolve, how networks can benefit from these new elements, and how they can cope with the new challenges that arise. The focus was on the key challenges of the field and on the most fundamental problems to look at in the next 10 years, together with an aim to identify the \"right\" steps to take to move forward and the key problems to tackle next.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe have made some progress toward answering the following synergistic research questions during the seminar: What is the right division of labor between control and data plane? What are the right high-level language abstractions for programming networks, and what  uarantees could we expect a compiler to provide reachability, security, or even properties as detailed as the correct use of cryptography? What is the trade-off between making more intelligent data plane architectures and the resulting network performances? Can we enhance current methods adopted to check network configuration errors with new solutions that automatically assure the absence of misconfiguration?\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the rest of the report we summarise the outcome of the most relevant discussions we had during the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gianni Antichi, Theophilus Benson, Nate Foster, Fernando M.

These communities are far from unknown to each other as they attend the same general academic conferences. But as each community has its own specialized conferences, there is less interaction between these communities than there should be. Further there are differences in the types of algorithmic problems these communities are naturally drawn towards. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe primary objective of the seminar was to expose each community to the important models, problems and techniques from the other community, and to facilitate dialog and collaboration between researchers. The program included 22 invited main talks including an inspiring talk on practical applications at ABB Corporate Research, 8 short spot-light talks, two open problem sessions in the beginning of the week, and ample unstructured time for research and interaction. The overall atmosphere among the 44 participants was very interactive.\n</p> \n <p>\nA highlight of the seminar was a joint Wednesday-session with the Dagstuhl Seminar 18102 \"Dynamic Traffic Models in Transportation Science\". It was a fortunate coincidence that both seminars were scheduled in parallel. Indeed, questions related to networks, scheduling and resource sharing arise naturally in traffic control and transportation science. It was an inspiring secondary outcome of the workshop to realize this strong overlap in interests which led to interesting discussions between researchers of the different communities.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Magn\u00fas M.

            "title": "Adaptive Resource Management for HPC Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nToday's supercomputers have very static resource management. Jobs are submitted via batch scripts to the resource manager, then scheduled on the machine with a fixed set of nodes. Other resources, such as power, network bandwidth and storage are not actively managed and are provided only on a best-effort basis. This inflexible, node-focused and static resource management will have to change in the future due to many reasons, some of them listed below.\n</p> \n <p>\nFirst, applications are becoming increasingly more dynamic. Techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement, e.g., as used in Tsunami simulations, lead to scalability changes over the application's execution. Furthermore, only some application phases might profit from specialized accelerators, and I/O phases might even run best with a limited number of compute resources.\n</p> \n <p>\nAdditionally, the execution environment of applications is also becoming dynamic. Modern processors change the clock frequency according to the instruction mix as well as power and thermal envelopes. Heavy use of the vector units can lead to a lower clock frequency to stay in the thermal power budget, for example.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs an independent concern, due to the sheer number of components, failure rates are expected to increase thus slowing down computation or even leading to an increased number of node failures.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, the upcoming machines will be power constrained, which means that the power will have to be carefully distributed among all running applications. The resulting power capping will impact the application's performance due to adaptation of the clock frequency and due to manufacturing variability. These challenges in HPC will only be solvable by using a more adaptive resource management approach. For example, compute nodes need to be redistributed among running applications to adapt to changes in the application's resource requirements either due to a varying number of grid points or interspersed algorithmic phases that profit from certain accelerators; network and I/O bandwidth will have to be assigned to applications to avoid interference caused by contention of concurrent communication and I/O phases; power needs to be dynamically redistributed both within an application and across applications to enable increased efficiency. Dynamic redistribution of resources will also give more flexibility to the resource manager to schedule jobs on the available resources and thus reduce idle times and efficiency lowering contention scenarios, e.g., in the situation of big jobs waiting for execution.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar investigated a holistic, layered approach for adaptive resource management. It started with the resource management layer being responsible for scheduling applications on the machine and dynamically allocating resources to the running applications. At the programming level, applications need to be programmed in a resource-aware style such that they can adapt to resource changes and can make most efficient usage of the resources. On top of the programming interfaces, programming tools have to be available that allow the application developers to analyze and tune the applications for the varying amount of available resources. At the application level, applications have to be redesigned to enable significant gains in efficiency and throughput, e.g., adaptive mesh refinement, approximate computing, and power-aware algorithms are a few aspects to mention here.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe discussions led to a joint summary presenting the state-of-the-art, required techniques on these layers of HPC systems, as well as the foreseen advantages of adaptive resource management. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michael Gerndt, Masaaki Kondo, Barton P.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe topic of blockchains, and in particular that of permissioned blockchains, has rapidly gained interest in both the industrial and the research communities in recent years. It particularly pertains to situations where trust among several parties that are about to do business together is difficult to establish (e.g., due to organizational, financial, or timing reasons) or impossible to establish at all. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that consists of immutable blocks containing transactions that can be accessed by any party, and that provides trust via replication over all nodes and an agreed-upon execution order of the transactions. Of particular interest are permissioned blockchains in which the associated parties are known and authenticated, yet still do not fully trust each other.\n</p> \n <p>\nMany applications have shown interest in the concept of blockchains, since the situation just described applies to many real-world scenarios, including (global) supply chains, the Internet of Things, connected cars, manufacturing, banking, and healthcare. As a consequence, a number of players in the IT industry work on a development of the technology, and several consortia have been formed to advance the technology across industries, among them Hyperledger and R3. Moreover, a number of companies have released Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, including IBM, Oracle, Amazon, Baidu, and Alibaba.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe technology has many links into the database community; however, the situation is basically like it was in the database area many years ago, when only a few systems had been released but users were on their own to figure out how to use them effectively. As the seminar has shown, many interesting issues remain to be solved, and there is a wide variety of aspects and research issues currently under investigation. Of these, the following were discussed:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Blockchain scalability w.r.t. transaction throughput, one of the main roadblocks to business adoption\n</li><li> Transaction ordering and endorsement, consensus of transaction commit\n</li><li> AAdjustments to the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, other optimizations to consensus algorithms (e.g., Byzantine consensus) in the presence of transaction failures and in light of scalability\n</li><li> Block validation\n</li><li> Languages for smart-contract specification (e.g., Sandcastle SQL and Solidity)\n</li><li> Amendments to Hyperledger Fabric, such as channels\n</li><li> Cross-chain swaps using hashed timelocks\n</li><li> Energy efficiency of blockchain applications\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    C.

High-throughput and high-resolution techniques help us generate and collect vast amounts of data to be explored, analyzed, and turned into knowledge or actionable models. This abundance of biological data creates a substantial challenge in processing, analysis, and modeling. A popular way to address this challenge is through visual representation and analysis of the data. Creating compelling visualizations of biological data requires combining data visualization, bioinformatics, statistics, and computational biology. The field of biological visualization is interdisciplinary and involves collaboration between researchers from different areas.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur aim with this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to discuss how to continue the interdisciplinary dialogue and foster the development of an international community concerned with biological visualization. We aimed to examine the state of the art and find areas to advance the research that might benefit from the joint efforts of all groups involved. \n</p> \n <p>\nOur initial aim, expressed in the seminar proposal, was to explore the following four topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>data abstraction to support building custom visual tools of biological data,\n</li><li> interactive analysis for biological data exploration,\n</li><li> collaboration and communication through new tools,\n</li><li> curriculum for teaching visualization in bioinformatics.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nWe have discussed these topics in the first two days of our five-day seminar and gradually came out with the following six working groups:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>facilitating cross-expertise exploration in explainable AI for multi-omics via visualization,\n</li><li> visions for the lab notebook of the future,\n</li><li> visual analytics of multilayer networks representing knowledge graphs,\n</li><li> recommendations for designing visual, interpretable, and deep learning-based analytics pipelines in medical imaging,\n</li><li> semantically enabled biomedical cartooming,\n</li><li> a curriculum for the future of biological visualization.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Notice that with this new set of topics for the working groups, our seminar still closely followed our initial aim to explore the space of data abstractions, interactive analysis, and design of tools to support collaborations. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe have developed the schedule for the seminar based on our experience and expertise in previous successful Dagstuhl seminars. We aim to emphasize the balance between prepared talks and panels and breakout groups for less structured discussions focused on a selection of highly relevant topics. Three types of plenary presentations were available to participants who had indicated an interest in presenting during the seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Overview talks (20 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions)\n</li><li> Regular talks (10 minutes plus 5 minutes for questions)\n</li><li> Panel presentations (5 minutes per speaker followed by a 20 -- 25 minute discussion)\n</li></ul> \n <p>The breakout groups met multiple times for several hours during the week and reported to the overall group on several occasions. This format successfully brought bioinformatics and visualization researchers onto the same platform and enabled researchers to reach a shared, deep understanding through their questions and answers. It also stimulated fruitful discussions that all participants deeply appreciated. \n</p> \n <p>We have organized the seminar during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to various regulations and quarantines, slightly above half of the participants attended in person, while the other participants attended online. The meeting took the hybrid form, and we thank Dagstuhl for equipping the seminar rooms with suitable hardware. Still, we found the organization of the hybrid meeting challenging, to say the least, as it imposed constraints on the discussion and engagement of everyone. An all-important part of Dagstuhl's experience is off-line meetings during meals, trips, or long evenings, which online participants miss. Thus, also following the responses in the participants' survey, we would endorse their recommendation that Dagstuhl should return to the previous, non-hybrid format of seminars once the pandemic stops.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis report describes in detail the outcomes of our meeting. At the present stage, the outcome includes a set of white papers summarizing the breakout sessions, overviews of the talks, and an emerging detailed curriculum for future biological and medical visualization eduction. \n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>We would like to thank all participants of the seminar for their contributions and lively discussions; we also would like to thank the scientific directorate of Dagstuhl for providing us with the opportunity to organize this seminar. Finally, the seminar would not have been possible without the untiring help of the (scientific) staff of Dagstuhl, including Ms. Jutka Gasiorowski and Ms. Susanne Bach-Bernhard.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Kay Katja Nieselt, Karsten Klein, Georgeta Elisabeta Marai, and Blaz Zupan\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar brought together leading experts in the fields of AI\nplanning, constraint programming and operations research. These areas\nhistorically come from different roots but are all concerned with\nsupporting decision making in complex systems which a huge space of\ninteracting options. While the approach and focus is different, some\nconcepts have been developed in multiple areas and some solution\ntechniques are or could be transfered. There is also a growing\nintersection of the areas that considers hybrid problems or uses\nsolvers developed in one area to solve problems from a different area,\nfor example by compiling planning problems into MIP or by using CP for\nsubproblems in a MIP solver. Solvers of a different community are often\nused as black boxes and the deeper understanding of each other's area\nof expertise that was developed in this seminar will help to foster\ncollaboration and transfer knowledge between the areas.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with eleven short but intense tutorials on Monday\nand Tuesday morning. The tutorials on Monday conveyed the basics of AI\nPlanning, MIP, and CP. They also already introduced the main\nconnections between the fields by talking about compilations from\nplanning to CP and MIP and using LPs as heuristics in planning. The\ntutorials on Tuesday delved deeper into areas that became the focus of\ndiscussion later in the seminar, such as non-deterministic planning,\nMarkov decision processes, and decision diagrams. Front-loading these\ntutorials worked well to bring everyone up to speed and created a good\nbasis for the rest of the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe rest of the seminar was organized into working groups that included\none to three short presentations followed by a longer discussion all\nfocused on a central topic. Three of these sessions were organized as\nbreak-out sessions where the participants split into two groups, each\ndiscussion one topic and then reconvening to present the main points\ndiscussed in each group to each other. The schedule for each day was\ncreated on the evening before which kept the topics flexible and\nallowed the organizers to include topics that came up during the\ndiscussion. Notes on each of the working groups and abstracts of the\ntutorials are included in the rest of this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Florian Pommerening\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>What prevents analysts from acquiring wisdom from data sources? To use\ndata, to better understand the world and act upon it, we need to\nunderstand both the computational and the human-centric aspects of\ndata-intensive work. In this Dagstuhl Seminar, we sought to establish\nthe foundations for the next generation of data management and\nvisualization systems by bringing together these two largely\nindependent communities. While exploratory data analysis (EDA) has\nbeen a pillar of data science for decades, maintaining interactivity\nduring EDA has become difficult, as the data size and complexity\ncontinue to grow. Modern statistical systems often assume that all\ndata need to fit into memory in order to support\ninteractivity. However, when faced with a large amount of data, few\ntechniques can support EDA fluidly. During this process, interactivity\nis critical: if each operation takes hours or even minutes to finish,\nanalysts lose track of their thought process. Bad analyses cause bad\ninterpretations, bad actions and bad policies.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs data scale and complexity increases, the novel solutions that will ultimately enable interactive, large-scale EDA will have to come from truly interdisciplinary and international work. Today, database systems can store and query massive amounts of data, including methods for distributed, streaming and approximate computation. Data mining techniques provide ways to discover unexpected patterns and to automate and scale well-defined analysis procedures. Recent systems research has looked at how to develop novel database systems architectures to support the iterative, optimization-oriented workloads of data-intensive algorithms. Of course, both the inputs and outputs of these systems are ultimately driven by people, in support of analysis tasks. The life-cycle of data involves an iterative, interactive process of determining which questions to ask, the data to analyze, appropriate features and models, and interpreting results. In order to achieve better analysis outcomes, data processing systems require improved interfaces that account for the strengths and limitations of human perception and cognition. Meanwhile, to keep up with the rising tide of data, interactive visualization tools need to integrate more techniques from databases and machine learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar brought together researchers from the two communities (visualization and databases) to establish a research agenda towards the development of next generation data management and interactive visualization systems.\nIn a short amount of time, the two communities learned from each other, identified the strengths and weaknesses of the latest techniques from both fields, and together developed a \"state of the art\" report on the open challenges that require the collaboration of the two communities.\nThis report documents the outcome of this collaborative effort by all the participants.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Remco Chang, Jean-Daniel Fekete, Juliana Freire, and Carlos E.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar brought researchers and practitioners together from multiple research communities with disparate views of what bots are and what they can do for software engineering.  The goals were to understand how bots are used today, how they could be used in innovative ways in the future, how the use of bots can be compared and synthesized, and to identify and share risks and challenges that may emerge from using bots in practice.  pagebreak\n</p> \n <p>\nBots, often called chatbots, are considered by some to be computer programs that provide a conversational style interface for interacting with software services, while others consider bots to be any semi-autonomous software service that may or may not take on a human-like persona.  \n</p> \n <p>\nRegardless of the definition of what makes a bot a bot, bots are found in many domains such as shopping, entertainment, education, and personal productivity. In software development, bots are rapidly becoming a <em>de facto</em> interface for developers and end users to interact with software services in a myriad of ways: e.g., bots are used to fetch or share information, extract and analyze data, detect and monitor events and activities in communication and social media, connect developers with key stakeholders or with other tools, and provide feedback and recommendations on individual and collaborative tasks.\n</p> \n <p>\nThrough this Dagstuhl Seminar, we aimed to gain important insights on how bots may play a role in improving software development productivity and in enhancing collaborative software development. In particular we discussed how bots, with or without a conversational UI, may play a prominent role in software practice. We gathered literature and resources on how bots can have an impact on development processes, software quality, and on end users.  The goal was to channel previously siloed communities and through this confluence forge a common vision and plot next steps that might leverage the variety of expertise and push forward both the research and the practices related to bots.  The activities were meant to surface the difficult questions and tensions that arise when one looks beyond what at first blush appears to be a superficial distinction, but in fact touches upon core values and driving questions that define the boundaries between fields.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    James D.

            "data": "\n <p>Seminar 18281, about the ``Synergies between Adaptive Analysis of Algorithms, Parameterized Complexity, Compressed Data Structures and Compressed Indices'', gathered researchers from \nfour distinct research areas (with some researchers having results in up to three such areas, but none in all four):\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>the area of adaptive analysis of algorithms; \n</li><li> the study of parameterized complexity of NP-hard problems; \n</li><li> the area focused on compressed data structures; and \n</li><li> the area concerned with the study of compressed indices.  \n</li></ol> \n <h4>Goals</h4> \n <p>The intuition behind gathering people from such diverse communities was that while all of these subareas of algorithms and data structures focus on \"going beyond the worst-case\" for classes of structurally restricted inputs, there has been a limited amount of interactions between them, and some results have been \"discovered\" twice. Therefore, the main goal of the seminar was to share knowledge and make joint progress through dedicated survey talks and plenty of time for discussions and work on open problems.\n</p> \n <h4>Structure</h4> \n <p>The seminar consisted of\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>a first session of personal introductions, each participant presenting his expertise and themes of interests in two slides;\n</li><li>  a small series of technical talks, some organized a long time in advance, and some improvised \"on demand\"; and\n</li><li>  a larger series of presentation of open problems, with ample time left for the participants to gather and work on such open problems.  \n</li></ol> \n <h4>Conclusion</h4> \n <p>Most participants concurred that they learned a lot from the seminar, and acquired new contacts to foster further collaborations.\nIn particular, interactions between the adaptive analysis of algorithms and the study of the parameterized complexity of NP-hard problems seemed relevant to the recent development of conditional lower bounds for problems classically solved in polynomial time, an approach referred to as \"Fine Grained Analysis\" or \"FPT in P\".\n</p> \n <p>\nGenerally, it appears that the seminar struck a good balance between scheduled sessions for survey talks and presentation of open problems as well as free time for discussion and interaction. During the free time, many smaller groups got together for work on open problems or for informal presentations of more specialist topics with a smaller audience. We think that this setup, along with the longer than usual round of introductions on the first day, was very successful at bringing together the different research areas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    J\u00e9r\u00e9my Barbay, Johannes Fischer, Stefan Kratsch, and Srinivasa Rao Satti\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Visual Computing in Materials Sciences",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIn this Dagstuhl workshop, we brought together computer and computational scientists interested in building tools for use in visual computing with material scientists with expressed interest in using such tools.  As would be anticipated when one brings together two distinct fields, the initial challenge we encountered was that of language.  Although both groups came together having experiences with visual computing tools - some as developers and some as users - although they often used the same terms, they semantically meant different things.  We found that the Dagstuhl philosophy of \"immersion\" was most helpful to this issue as having several days together helped break down these barriers.  Over the course of the week, we interspersed talks by computational scientists and material scientists.  The talks by computational scientists often presented their current understanding of what kinds of tools are needed, demonstrations of current tools they have developed in collaboration with domain-specific experts, and success stories of applications they have currently impacted.  The talks by the material scientists often presented a description of the tools they currently use, the positive points and deficiencies of current tools, the types of features that they would like to see in future tools, and examples of current challenge problems and how they might be impacted by the next generation of tools. \n</p> \n <h4>Fundamental Results:</h4> \n <ol>\n<li>The systems that are desired by many material scientists will be used both for exploration and for interactive steering.  When used for exploration, material scientists want tools that not only present the data with its corresponding reliability (uncertainty) bounds, but which also give predictive capabilities such as where next to sample.\n</li><li> There is a general acknowledgement that both automation and interactivity are needed.  Automation of tasks and procedures through AI and Machine Learning can be used to help deal with the volumes of data being produced - helping scientists sift through the field of possibilities to isolate those places for which they should expend human effort.  At the same time, there are many current practices that continue to require \"the human in the loop\" to make decisions.  In such cases, tools are needed that have smart defaults but yet allow the user to explore, navigate and possibly refine data.\n</li><li> Although many current tools used for material science applications leverage previous visualization and interaction technologies, there is still much to be done.  Many material science applications require specialization of currently existing algorithms and techniques, especially in cases of real-time systems.  Furthermore, many techniques originally designed for batch or manual processing need to be re-engineered to allow for the interactive procedures required by current and future material science application scientists. \n</li><li> With regards to visualization scientists, there is a need for both data and tasks.  Many researchers requested data on which they can try their methods.  In addition to the data itself, descriptors of the data are necessary so that it can be interpreted properly. Once read into their system, the visualization scientists then requested a collection of tasks (driven by the material science domain experts) which would help drive their tool development and evaluation.\n</li></ol> \n <h4>Final Comments</h4> \n <p>Due to the ever-increasing interest in this topic, we foresee that future review articles and/or special issues of journals driven by multilateral research cooperations between seminars' participants will be an outcome of this workshop. To ensure and stimulate further cooperation in this field, a list of specific follow up activities has been elaborated and discussed with the participants. All in all, a fruitful discussion was stimulated across the two domains throughout the complete week of this Dagstuhl workshop which will become more obvious in joint research efforts of all kinds.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Christoph Heinzl, Robert Michael Kirby, Stepan V.

            "title": "Universals of Linguistic Idiosyncrasy in Multilingual Computational Linguistics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar was initially planned as a 1-week event in June 2020 (with number 20261) with the following objectives:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Theoretical</b>: To deepen the understanding of language universals, and of how they apply to linguistic idiosyncrasy, so as to further promote unified modelling while preserving diversity.\n</li><li><b>Practical</b>: To improve the treatment of idiosyncrasy in treebanking frameworks, in computationally tractable ways and, thus, to foster high quality NLP tools for more languages with greater typological diversity.\n</li><li><b>Networking</b>: To promote a higher degree of convergence across typology-driven initiatives, while focusing on three main aspects of language modelling: morphology, syntax, and semantics. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was first rescheduled and finally reduced to a 2-day online event on 30-31 August 2021, with two 3-hour sessions, repeated for better inclusiveness of various time zones (which corresponds to about 20% of the initially planned duration). \n</p> \n <p>\nPrior to the event, participants submitted discussion issues, based on which working groups and the program were formed, as described in our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/unlid/dagstuhl-seminar/-/wikis/home\">Wiki space</a>.\n</p> \n <p>\nMore precisely, the program of the event followed the Dagstuhl model: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>A list of recommended <b>readings</b> was published prior to the event\n </li><li><b>Introductory talks</b>, given by the 4 organizers, ensured common understanding of the scope and challenges to address.\n</li><li><b>Personal introductions</b> of all participants helped achieve a community building effect, despite the online setting.\n </li><li><b>Working groups</b> (WGs) were built on the basis of the discussion issues submitted by the participants. Each WG had 4 co-leaders, at least one of which could attend repeated sessions, so as to ensure consistency between the 2 time-zone sub-groups. The following WGs were created:\n<ul>\n<li> WG1: What counts as a word?\n       </li><li> WG2: What counts as a MWE and as a construction?\n       </li><li> WG3: Syntax vs. semantics\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Discussion issues</b> were addressed in WGs by the proposers' short introductions followed by brainstorming.\n</li><li> Plenary <b>reporting</b> sessions from WGs took place twice for every time zone.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The event attracted 51 participants, who judged it successful and expressed the need for a full-size onsite follow-up event. All the organizational details and outcomes of the seminar are gathered in our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/unlid/dagstuhl-seminar/-/wikis\">Wiki space</a>.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite its very reduced and fully online format, the seminar achieved part of its objectives, stressed the importance of some initially-defined research questions, gave rise to new questions, and showed the efficiency of some instruments.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> On the <b>networking</b> side, the intended convergence effect was clearly apparent. While the initial proposal and invitee list was dominated by NLP-oriented members of the UD and PARSEME communities, strong contributions came notably from the less numerous typology and UniMorph experts. The four communities interacted actively, and reinforcing these interactions is intended for the near future. Notably, steps were taken towards: \n<ul>\n<li> integrating typology experts in the PARSEME core group\n </li><li> accompanying a seminal work in typology (Croft, to appear) with a \"companion volume\" about practical implementation of morphosyntactic concepts in UD.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li> On the <b>theoretical</b> side, the event showed:\n<ol>\n<li> The importance of the research question <em>How to identify words across languages?</em> (item I.A in the seminar proposal), to which the whole of Working Group 1 was dedicated. In particular, new insights from lesser-studied languages, brought by typology experts, allowed us to broaden the perspective on this issue.  \n   \n</li><li> The need for capturing the relationship between the two fundamental notions in this proposal:  a multiword expression and a construction, studied by Working Group 2. From the linguistic and typology perspective, a MWE is a special case of a construction, which is rarely made explicit in current NLP models. But the notion of a construction needs a more formal definition to be implementable in NLP, notably as far as the type-token opposition is concerned (question II.B in the seminar proposal). Thus, the typology-NLP interactions are essential in the quest for an optimal model.\n</li><li> The scope of the syntax-semantics interface issues (question II in the proposal) addressed by Working Group 3. On the one hand, the interests of the community in this respect exceeded the scope intended by the event organizers. Namely corpus-lexicon interlinking for all language units, not only for MWEs, was targeted. On the other hand, MWEs are exemplars of condensed syntax-semantic interface issues, and as such provide good case studies in this domain.\n</li></ol>\n</li><li> On the <b>practical</b> side, some initial proposals emerged as to harmonizing UD treebank annotation guidelines with: (i) modelling morphological properties at the subword level (heavily studied by UniMorph), (ii) labelling MWEs (core activity of PARSEME).\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nEach multidisciplinary approach like ours bears heavy risks of intractability. This is because different communities often have different objectives and points of view on the same phenomena, and they may fail to agree on a unified approach, or even on the usefulness of working towards such a unification. In our case, there is a tension between: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> diversity and descriptive detail required in linguistics, \n</li><li> necessary simplifications for the sake of robustness in NLP. \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn other words, it is legitimate to question the usefulness of universality-driven initiatives (in NLP) if idiosyncrasy and diversity are basic properties of language data. Yet even typologists seek language universals which abstract away from the idiosyncrasy. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe feel that the event allowed us to mitigate this tension. Namely, even if a universality-based treebank fails to render the diversity of possible analyses of a language phenomenon, it is still useful not only for NLP applications but also for linguistic and typological analyses. This is because relevant examples are easy to extract (and to further re-interpret), as long as the annotation is consistent and well-documented. \n</p> \n <p>\nAnother barrier-lifting effect of the event concerned the relation between UD and PARSEME. It seems that the MWE categories defined by UD and PARSEME are less incompatible than initially expected, simply because the definition of an MWE in itself is different in UD and PARSEME. This could have been a source of major incompatibility but since a MWE does not really have a status in the UD annotation process, the discrepancies could (at least in some cases) be overcome relatively easily.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn conclusion, the event provided, in our opinion, a proof of concept for the framing objectives set up in the original Dagstuhl seminar proposal. However, since the effective framework and duration was severely reduced as compared to the initially intended setting, only part of these objectives could be achieved. Thus, we are currently putting efforts to ensure follow-up events. In particular, a new Dagstuhl seminar with roughly the same objectives has been submitted.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Timothy Baldwin, William Croft, Joakim Nivre, and Agata Savary\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "The Human Factors Impact of Programming Error Messages",
            "data": "\n <p>\nProgramming error messages (commonly called compiler error messages) pose challenges to programmers - from novices to professionals - with evidence dating from the 1960s to present day. In this seminar, we explored the nature of these challenges and particularly why they remain largely unaddressed. We further investigated the specific challenges that different users including children, non-native English speakers, and those of varying ability experience when faced with programming error messages. Finally, we sought to identify the most promising avenues to assess the effectiveness of error messages, how to improve them with large, demonstrated effect, and how to produce appropriate messages for different users with different needs. To this end, we assembled experts from many sub-disciplines of Computer Science, including Programming Languages, HCI, Computer Science Education, and Software Engineering as well as Learning Sciences.  Due to travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we ran the seminar in a hybrid format, with 11 on-site participants collaborating with 17 remote participants.  We formulated a schedule for the seminar that sought to maximise outcomes for all participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nBy combining the expertise of these different disciplines, we could identify gaps in knowledge and high-priority areas to build a basis for future work. This is the starting point for a long-lasting contribution to the field. By uniting communities that have to date been working largely in isolation, we sought to gather appropriate and useful data, broaden perspectives, build consensus among diverse stakeholders, and begin cross-community efforts working in unison going forward.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, we had sessions focusing on existing literature and practice, including experience reports from language maintainers, expert users, researchers, and educators, to develop a shared understanding of the evidence that exists with regard to effective programming error messages. This included the group working together to synthesise existing data sets, which we view as an important exercise given that large corpora of errors and error message data are generally not openly available.  This can make it difficult for researchers to answer seemingly simple questions such as: \"What are the most frequent error messages encountered by [students, professionals, blind, non-native English speakers] in language x?\" or, \"What are evidence-based examples of effective and/or ineffective error messages?\". As a result, we identified several fruitful avenues in the form of cross-discipline collaboration, data sharing opportunities, and improved focus on what steps are needed to improve efforts to answer these questions. \n</p> \n <p>One of the key objectives of the seminar was to \nidentify areas for immediate research. Several problems have been identified, including but not limited to: \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>linking error messages with the context of the problems and programs being worked on when error messages are generated;\n</li><li> understanding the metacognitive aspects involved in the process of interpreting and reacting to error messages;\n</li><li> identifying what error messages arise from inconsistent conceptions of how a program runs or how it is structured;\n</li><li> the  effects of error message presentation on error message interpretation (e.g. visual queues, structured error messages, etc.);\n</li><li> error message classification schemes;\n</li><li> metrics to measure and assess error messages;\n</li><li> identifying when error messages are \"wrong\", what occurs when they steer the programmer in the wrong direction, and how this can be avoided; \n</li><li> determining the design factors of programming error messages that differ across demographic groups (e.g., expertise level, disabilities, native/natural language, etc.).\n</li></ol> \n <p>Another key objective was to establish new cross-community efforts to improve programming error messages in practice, leveraging the strengths of each community. Participants discussed open research problems and identified those of high priority and interest including those listed above. Several interdisciplinary research objectives have been established, and seeds were sewn to form teams to collaboratively address these research questions.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Brett A.

            "title": "Scalability in Multiobjective Optimization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nTo continue being useful to society, MO has to address new challenges brought to science and engineering by big data that are continuously being produced and stored with a much lower cost than ever in the past. Since massive production of data takes place in the areas of human activity that have traditionally benefited from MCDM (e.g., social media analysis, retail sales, or high-frequency finance),\nMO needs to enter a new stage of development to be able to handle the high-dimensional data. Driven by this increasing availability of data and also motivated by an unprecedented demand for efficient, reliable and robust optimization methods, research in MO has to focus on the particular difficulties arising in large-scale problems. This requires from MCDM researchers new statistical thinking and leads to an increasing demand for efficient solution methods for large-scale problems, involving <em>many</em> objective functions and/or constraints, <em>many</em> decision makers, <em>many</em> variables and large amounts of data.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn this spirit, the focus in the  seminar was on <em>scalability</em> which has become a universal challenge for mathematical optimization, and for EMO <em>and</em> MCDM in particular. <em>Scalability</em> is a characteristic of a system that describes its capability to cope and perform under an increased or expanding workload. A system that scales well will be able to maintain or even increase its level of performance or efficiency when tested by larger operational demands. In an economic context,  a company's scalability implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company. Therefore the main goals of the seminar were the exploration and elucidation of scalability in three fundamental domains: MO with many objective functions, MO with many decision makers, and MO with many variables.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile single objective optimization problems possess (at most) one optimal objective value, biobjective optimization problems are already intractable in many cases, i.e., combinatorial problems such as, for example, shortest path and spanning tree problems, may have an exponential number of nondominated solutions. Going from two to three objectives is another major step in difficulty since there does no longer exist a complete ordering of nondominated solutions. Problems with <em>many objective functions</em> pose even greater challenges.\nSince the number of nondominated solutions generally grows exponentially with the number of objective functions (as long as these are conflicting), efficient strategies for the detection of redundancies, for model reduction and for metamodelling are crucial for the scalability of existing methods. In the domain of MO with many objective functions the following specific topics were addressed:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Model building</em> and the derivation of technical properties are crucial for understanding the specific challenges in many-objective optimization. The following topics were undertaken: (i) Identification of interdependencies between objective functions as compared to real conflict; (ii) Relevance of many objective functions to a given real-life decision-making situation; (iii) Exploration of mathematical or statistical tools that can compress information while retaining the important problem features. Methodological approaches in this context included data analysis, metamodelling, partial and full scalarization, and a new concept for approximation schemes with quality guarantees.\n</li><li> Concise <em>representations</em> are indispensable for the development of efficient algorithms, particularly EMO algorithms, interactive approaches, and decision support tools. The scalability of quality measures and associated representations, including hypervolume, uniformity, coverage, and varepsilon-indicator were discussed and novel representation and visualization paradigms suitable for many-objective optimization were proposed.  \n</li><li><em>Efficient solution algorithms</em> that scale well with an increasing number of objective functions or computationally expensive objective functions are needed.\nThe shortcomings of existing methods were discussed and  new strategies that are specifically designed for large-scale problems were derived.\n</li><li><em>Scalable test cases</em> are needed for the evaluation of the developed approaches. This has been a concern of the EMO community to some extent. The difficulties pertaining to construction of the test cases were identified and future work in this direction was proposed.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe discussion of MO with many decision makers considered the inherent changes in the decision process as soon as there is not just a single decision maker. The focus was on building a formal framework that guarantees a fair decision respecting the preferences of all decision makers with the least total loss.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe domain of MO with many variables was discussed jointly with the domain of MO with many objective functions because large-scale optimization problems involving many variables and large amounts of data often also involve many objective functions. However, an emphasis was put on the required adaptations of EMO and MCDM approaches to handle problems with a high-dimensional decision space. While EMO algorithms often scale relatively well with an increasing dimension of the decision space (at least as long as the number of objective functions remains relatively small), this is in general not the case for MCDM approaches. In particular, the most commonly used exact solution approaches, such as dynamic programming and branch and bound, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Complexity theoretic aspects were discussed and \nthe use of approximation paradigms, metamodelling, hybridization, or parallelization in this situation was  investigated.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar the schedule was updated on a daily basis to maintain flexibility in balancing time slots for talks, discussions, and working groups, and to integrate in the program the talks whose authors were inspired by the ongoing seminar. The working groups were established on the first day in an interactive fashion. Starting with three large  working groups focused around the three central topics of the seminar (MO with many objectives, MO with many decision makers, and MO with many variables), each participant was requested to formulate her/his favorite topics and most important challenges.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThe three groups then rejoined and the prevailing topics were put into groups through a natural clustering process while the participants made up initial five working groups.  \nDuring the week the participants were allowed to change the working groups while some groups split. Overall, the teams remained fairly stable throughout to eventually form eight groups by the end of the seminar. Abstracts of the talks and extended abstracts of the eight working groups can be found in subsequent chapters of this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nFurther notable events during the week included: (i) an invitation to the opening of the art exhibition with paintings of the artist Lola Sprenger, (ii) a hike during a time period with the best (!) weather conditions in the entire week, (iii) a presentation session allowing the participants to share details of upcoming events in the research community, and (iv) a wine and cheese party (see Fig. 1) made possible by a donation of Fraunhofer-Institut f\u00fcr Technound\nWirtschaftsmathematik (ITWM) represented by Karl-Heinz K\u00fcfer. The participants are pleased to announce that they made a donation to Schloss Dagstuhl to make a painting by Lola Sprenger entitled \u201cBerg und Tal\u201d part of the permanent art display.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4560/figWC1.jpg\" width=\"20%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4561/figWC2.jpg\" width=\"20%\"/> \n <h3>Offers and Needs Market</h3> \n <p>\nA major innovation to this seminar was the Offers &amp; Needs Market open for the entire week. The participants could write their research offers and needs regarding MO on notepads in different colors and post on pin boards (see fig. Traditional wine &amp; cheese party) to attract or find a possible collaborator. The idea was well received and the participants desired its repetition in future events.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4562/figNeeds.jpg\" width=\"20%\"/> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4563/figOffers.jpg\" width=\"20%\"/> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>The outcomes of each of the working groups can be seen in the sequel. Extended versions of their findings will be submitted to a Special Issue of  <em>Computers and Operations Research</em> entitled \"Modern Trends in Multiobjective Optimization\" and guest-edited by the organizers of this Dagstuhl seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar resulted in a very insightful, productive and enjoyable week. It has already led to first new results and formed new cooperation, research teams and topics. \n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>The organizers would like to express their appreciation to the Dagstuhl office and its helpful and patient staff for their professional and smooth cooperation; huge thanks to the organizers of the previous seminars in this series for setting us up for success; and thanks to all the participants, who worked hard and were amiable company all week.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis report contains the program and outcomes of the Dagstuhl Seminar 21371 on <em>Integrated Deduction</em> that was held at Schloss Dagstuhl, Leibniz Center for Informatics, during September 12-17, 2017. It was the fourteenth in a series of Dagstuhl Deduction seminars held biennially since 1993.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe motivation for this seminar was the following. Automated deduction has developed a wide and diverse range of methods and tools for logico-deductive reasoning. They include SAT solvers, SMT solvers, automated theorem provers, aka ATP systems, proof assistants, aka interactive theorem provers (ITP),\nas well as libraries of formalized mathematics and formalized knowledge.\nThese methods and tools have found successful application in computing fields as diverse as the <em>analysis, verification, and synthesis of systems</em>, <em>programming language design</em>, <em>knowledge engineering</em>, and <em>computer mathematics</em>. However, no method, tool, paradigm, or even reasoning style can solve all problems, or respond to all demands coming from even a single field of application. Therefore, the next grand challenge for automated deduction is <em>integration</em>.\n</p> \n <p>\nIntegration occurs and is needed at different abstraction levels.\nWithin deduction itself, integration of deductive engines allows us to build more powerful, more flexible, more expressive reasoners, that can solve more problems with fewer resources, meaning not only memory and computing time, but also human time and human expertise, the latter two often being the most precious of resources. Next, deductive reasoners get integrated into other tools, such as <em>automated test generators</em>, <em>verifying compilers</em>, or <em>program synthesizers</em>, just to name a few.\nYet another level of integration occurs when <em>logico-deductive reasoning</em> is integrated with other forms of automated reasoning,\nsuch as <em>probabilistic reasoning</em> and <em>statistical inference</em>.\nThis leads to the integration of deduction within <em>intelligent systems</em>, such as <em>decision support systems</em>, <em>agent programming environments</em>, and <em>data processing systems</em>.\nHere deduction may provide explanation, course of action, and the capability of learning from missing information; it may also aid modelling and facilitate agent communication.\n</p> \n <p>The seminar on <em>Integrated Deduction</em> successfully covered as many as possible of these integration issues, including:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Integration of deductive engines into more general automated deductive systems;\n</li><li> Integration of automated deductive systems into interactive proof assistants;\n</li><li> Integration of deduction into formal methods tools;\n</li><li> Integration of deduction for knowledge processing; and\n</li><li> Integration of deduction into intelligent systems such as agent-based systems.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nFurthemore, the seminar investigated a number of key technological and human-related issues,\nthat are largely orthogonal to most integration contexts, affecting both feasibility and deployment\nof integrated deduction. Examples of such issues are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The development of interfaces for integration;\n</li><li>The generation of continuous feedback during the run of deductive tools,\nincluding also information from intermediate or unsuccessful states;\n</li><li>The reproducibility of results in the presence of tool updates or imposed resource limits (e.g., available computation time or memory) that may introduce non-determinism; and\n</li><li>Advanced tradeoff's between performance and expressivity as well as between specialization and genericity.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nPractical challenges around integrated deductive systems, including collaboration with non-expert users or access to data sets, were also discussed.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together a diverse audience, including both researchers working in deduction and researchers working in neighbouring areas that make use of deduction. Many participants have experience in building, using, and applying systems with integrated deduction.\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing the tradition of the Dagstuhl <em>Seminars on Deduction</em>, most of the program consisted of contributed talks by participants on their research.\nIn this manner, the bottom-up style of the Dagstuhl experience was preserved,\nallowing for spontaneous contributions as they emerged during the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, this seminar was also innovative with respect to tradition,\nin that it featured <em>five invited tutorials</em> on key topics in integrated deduction. These tutorials were valuable in highlighting the state-of-the-art in the integration of deduction systems and in fomenting discussions on challenges and open problems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe program also featured a hike in the woods and a social dinner in a nearby village, that helped establishing or strengthtening collaborations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe following section contains the abstracts for most of the talks and tutorials listed in alphabetical order.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Maria Paola Bonacina, Philipp R\u00fcmmer, and Renate Schmidt\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nOur society is data-driven.  Large scale data analysis, known as Big\ndata, is distinctly present in the private lives of individuals, is a\ndominant force in commercial domains as varied as automatic manufacturing, e-commerce and personalized medicine, and assists in - or fully automates - decision making in the public and private sectors.  Data-driven algorithms are used in criminal sentencing - ruling who goes free and who remains behind bars, in college\nadmissions - granting or denying access to education, and in\nemployment and credit decisions - offering or withholding economic\nopportunities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe promise of Big data is to improve people's lives, accelerate\nscientific discovery and innovation, and enable broader participation.\nYet, if not used responsibly, Big data can increase economic\ninequality and affirm systemic bias, polarize rather than democratize,\nand deny opportunities rather than improve access.  Worse yet, all\nthis can be done in a way that is non-transparent and defies public\nscrutiny.\n</p> \n <p>\nBig data impacts individuals, groups and society as a whole. Because\nof the central role played by this technology, it must be used <em>responsibly</em> - in accordance with the ethical and moral norms that govern our society, and adhering to the appropriate legal and policy frameworks. And as journalists [3], legal and policy scholars [1,2] and governments [4,5] are calling for algorithmic fairness and greater insight into data-driven algorithmic processes, there is an urgent need to define a broad and coordinated computer science research agenda in this area.\nThe primary goal of the Dagstuhl Seminar \"Data, Responsibly\" was to\nmake progress towards such an agenda.\n</p> \n <p>The seminar brought together academic and industry researchers from\nseveral areas of computer science, including a broad representation of\ndata management, but also data mining, security/privacy, and computer\nnetworks, as well as social sciences researchers, data journalists,\nand those active in government think-tanks and policy initiatives.\nThe problem we aim to address is inherently transdisciplinary.  For\nthis reason, it was important to have input from policy and legal\nscholars, and to have representation from multiple areas within\ncomputer science.  We were able to attract a mix of European, North\nAmerican, and South American participants.  Out of 39 participants, 10\nwere women.\n</p> \n <p>Specific goals of the seminar were to:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>assess the state of data analysis in terms of fairness, transparency and diversity;\n</li><li> identify new research challenges;\n</li><li> develop an agenda for computer science research in responsible data analysis and use, with a particular focus on potential high-impact contributions from the data management community; \n</li><li> solicit perspectives on the necessary education efforts, and on responsible research and innovation practices.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar included technical talks and break-out sessions.\nTechnical talks were organized into themes, which included fairness\nand diversity, transparency and accountability, tracking and\ntransparency, personal information management, education, and\nresponsible research and innovation. Participants suggested topics\nfor seven working groups, which met over one or multiple days.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers felt that the seminar was very successful - ideas\nwere exchanged, discussions were lively and insightful, and we are\naware of several collaborations that were started as a result of the\nseminar.  The participants and the organizers all felt that the topic\nof the seminar is broad, fast moving and extremely important, and that\nit would be beneficial to hold another seminar on this topic in the\nnear future.\n</p> \n <p>\nDetails about the program are contained in the remainder of this\ndocument.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Kate Crawford.

It has attracted the interest of several communities, ranging from the field of denotational semantics and the problem of Full Abstraction, to software verification and Regression Testing.

There was a general agreement among the participants that a research community around this topic should be established in the form of a workshop and eventually a conference, and that the interest in this topic continuously grows around the world, including a growing interest in the industry. Furthermore, currently there is little overlap in the conferences that some of the key players attend, to the point that many participants were little aware of other participants' work.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe were happy to witness that indeed participants learned greatly from this week, collaborations were established, and cross fertilization between the communities occurred.

            "title": "Multidirectional Transformations and Synchronisations",
            "data": "\n <p>The Dagstuhl Seminar on \u201cMultidirectional Transformations and Synchronisations\u201d was the latest on a sequence of events [1] (coordinated by the Bx Steering Committee [2]) on bidirectional transformations (abbreviated bx) and related topics. Broadly speaking, the concern of the growing community interested in this topic is the maintenance of consistency between multiple data sources, in the presence of change that may affect any of them. The focus of this Dagstuhl meeting, in particular, was the special issues that arise when one considers more than two data sources at one time. Technical definitions of bx have always\nallowed for there to be more than two, but in practice, most work to date has focused on maintaining consistency between two data sources. We abbreviate \u201cmultidirectional transformation\u201d, hereinafter and generally, to <b>multx</b> or <b>mx</b>.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe began the week with a presentation of case studies and introductory tutorials, and towards the end of the week we had several plenary talks, in cases where someone was able to discuss work that seemed likely to be of general interest. Overall, though, this was a highly interactive Dagstuhl: most of our time during the week was spent either in working groups or, synergistically, discussing in plenary session the outcomes of those working groups and what else needed to be addressed. Reports from each of those working groups, and descriptions of the case studies, are found in the body of this report. Here we briefly introduce them. Inevitably, the topics of the groups overlapped, and some topics that were proposed for working groups were not reached during the week. We encouraged participants to move freely between groups to foster cross-fertilisation of ideas. The names given are those of the authors of the brief reports. Collectively, these topics comprise a research roadmap for the subject.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>WG1: <em>Whether Networks of Bidirectional Transformations Suffice for Multidirectional Transformations.</em>\nThis group began what turned out to be a recurring theme of the week: see below.\n</li><li>WG2: <em>Partial Consistency Notions.</em>\nThis relates to handling situations in which consistency is not perfectly restored, but only improved to some extent.\n</li><li>WG3: <em>Semantics of Multidirectional Transformations.</em>\nThis group raised questions about definitions of syntactic and semantic consistencies, vertical and horizontal propagation, etc. After creating enough awareness of the importance of this topic, the working group dissolved and its efforts were merged into others, in particular WG4, WG8 and WG12.\n<em>WG4: Multiple Interacting Bidirectional Transformations.</em> This group started with an intention of providing a good example of a \u201ctruly\u201d multidirectional transformation and defined scenarios where several multx and bx work together towards restoring consitency.\n</li><li>WG5:<em>Mathematical Backgrounds for Multidirectional Transformations.</em>\nFollowing on from WG1, this group considered, from a theoretical perspective, handling multx by the use of a common \u201cfederated\u201d supermodel related by spans of asymmetric lenses.\n</li><li>WG6: <em>Synchronisation Policy.</em> Separate from the issue of what the mechanism is to restore consistency, when should the mechanism be used, and whose decides that?\n</li><li>WG7: <em>Use Cases and the Definition of Multidirectional Transformations.</em>\nWhen are multx really necessary in practice, and how?\n</li><li>WG8: <em>Human Factors: Interests of Transformation Developers and Users.</em>\nSometimes in our focus on technical aspects we lose the human element \u2013 who are the humans involved and what do they need from whatever languages, tools and techniques are developed for multx?\n</li><li>WG9: <em>Provenance in Multidirectional Transformations.</em> Information about what changed and why \u2013 provenance and traceability \u2013 are crucial to\ntrust in multx; how can that information be provided and handled?\n</li><li>WG10: <em>Living in the Feet of the Span.</em> Following on from WG1 and WG5: what happens when one conceptually uses a common supermodel, but does not wish to materialise it?\n</li><li>WG11: <em>Programming Languages for Multidirectional Transformations.</em>\nThis group discussed the challenges that need to be met to produce such languages, with a focus on their type systems.\n</li><li>WG12: <em>Verification and Validation of Multidirectional Transformations.</em> What needs to be verified or validated about multx, and in what ways do these needs challenge the state of the art in verification and validation?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nA recurring theme of the week, turning up in one guise or another in most of the working groups, was the question of the extent to which excellent solutions to the two-source bx problems would, or would not, automatically solve the multx problems. Do problems involving multx really introduce new issues, or are they just more complicated than problems involving bx, perhaps organised in networks? The bx problem is far from solved \u2013 we do not yet, for example, have widely adopted and well-supported specialist bx languages \u2013 and so there was\nsome feeling that we lacked a firm foundation on which to address multx. More positively, considering multx has the potential to help bx research make progress, by motivating areas that still require more study in order to support the multx case. For example, heterogeneity of the languages in which the data sources and the changes to them are expressed clearly points to a need for bx, and hence multx, approaches that do not need to materialise edit histories for all the sources, nor a common supermodel for them \u2013 even if the theory that\naddresses them might still call on such things conceptually.\n</p> \n <p>The following case study descriptions are also included in the report:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Multidirectional Transformations for Microservices\n</li><li>Multidirectionality in Compiler Testing\n</li><li>Bringing Harmony to the Web\n</li><li> A Health Informatics Scenario\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nPerhaps the most important observation from this Dagstuhl meeting, though, is how broad the scope of the research necessary to address multx concerns is. The issues and examples discussed by participants went far beyond multidirectional versions of issues and examples already raised in earlier bx meetings. For example, microservices, the focus of the case study presented by Albert Z\u00fcndorf (\u00a74.1), would not traditionally have fallen under the bx umbrella, yet is clearly related. This widening of scope is natural. As IT systems become more interdependent and more important to our everyday lives, it is inevitable that data, and the (often separately developed) behaviour it supports, reside in many places. They are coupled, in the sense that changes in one place may mean that changes in another place are necessary, in order to maintain all of these systems in useful operation. Making all such changes manually does not\nscale: some degree of automated maintenance of consistency is inevitably required. Multx thus subsumes much of software engineering and inherits its concerns.

In the decoding phase, the missing data is reconstructed\nby interpolation with partial differential equations (PDEs) or\nby copying information from patches in other image regions.\nSuch codecs allow a very intuitive interpretation, and first\nexperiments show their advantages for high compression rates\nwhere they can beat even advanced transform-based methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, inpainting-based codecs are still in an early stage and\nrequire to solve a number of challenging fundamental problems,\nin particular:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Which data gives the best reconstruction?\n</li><li> What are the optimal inpainting operators?\n</li><li> How should the selected data be encoded and decoded?\n</li><li> What are the most efficient algorithms for real-time applications?\n</li></ul> \n <p>These problems are highly interrelated. Moreover, they require\ninterdisciplinary expertise from various fields such as image\ninpainting, data compression and coding, approximation theory,\nand optimisation. To design these codecs in an optimal way, one\nmust also understand their connections to related areas such\nas sparsity and compressed sensing, harmonic analysis, scattered \ndata approximation with radial basis functions, and subdivision \nstrategies.\n</p> \n <p>Our seminar constituted the first symposium on this topic. It \nbrought together 29 researchers from 11 countries, covering\na broad range of expertise in the different fields mentioned\nabove. Many of them have met for the first time, which resulted \nin a very fruitful interaction.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to have a good basis for joint discussions, first all\nparticipants introduced themselves and briefly described their\nbackground and interests. Then the seminar proceeded with six \ntutorial talks (45 minutes plus 15 minutes discussion), given \nby the four organisers as well as by Simon Masnou and Nira Dyn.\nIn this way all participants could acquire a general overview\non the achievements and challenges of inpainting-based image \ncompression and its various aspects such as coding, inpainting, \nconvex optimisation, subdivision, and computational harmonic analysis.\n</p> \n <p>Afterwards we decided to cluster the talks thematically into six\nsessions, each consisting of 3-4 talks (ca. 30 minutes plus 15\nminutes discussion) and lasting half a day:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Harmonic Analysis<br/>\n      (talks by Gerlind Plonka-Hoch, Naoki Saito, and Hao-Min Zhou)\n</li><li> Approximation Theory<br/>\n      (talks by Martin Buhmann, Armin Iske, Nira Dyn, and Tomas Sauer)\n</li><li> Inpainting<br/>\n      (talks by Aurelien Bourquard, Carola-Bibiane Sch\"onlieb, and\n      Yann Gousseau)\n</li><li> Compression<br/>\n      (talks by Gene Cheung, Joan Serra Sagrista, and Claire Mantel)\n</li><li> Optimisation of Data and Operators<br/>\n      (talks by Zakaria Belhachmi, Laurent Hoeltgen, Peter Ochs, and\n      Pascal Peter)\n</li><li> Algorithms, Biological Vision, and Benchmarking<br/>\n      (talks by Jalal Fadili, Johannes Ball\u00e9, and Sarah Andris)\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThese sessions triggered interesting discussions during the talks,\nin the breaks, and in the evening, and they allowed the different \ncommunities to learn many new things from each other.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur program featured also an evening panel discussion on open research\nquestions on the interface between image inpainting and image compression. \nIt was a lively interaction between the five panel members and the audience, \ninvolving also controversial statements and views about the future of\ninpainting-based codecs.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe participants had a very positive impression of this seminar as an\ninspiring forum to bring together different fields. As a consequence, \nthis symposium also created several new collaborations, e.g. regarding \ninterpolation with radial basis functions, subdivision-based coding, and \ndiffusion-based coding. There was a general consensus that it would \nbe desirable to have another seminar on this topic in 2-3 years.\nMoreover, it is planned to compile a related monograph which will be \nthe first in its field.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Joachim Weickert\n                </div> \n",

While being formally a very old research\nfield, building the theoretical foundations for Cheminformatics seen\nfrom the perspective of state-of-the-art theoretical Computer Science\nis not at all established research. The second edition of the seminar on\n``Algorithmic Cheminformatics'' brought together researchers\nworking in Chemistry, Cheminformatics, and most importantly the \nrelevant fields in Computer Science related to\nit. In contrast to the first Dagstuhl meeting in 2014, we specifically\nfocused on the analysis of the behaviour of chemical systems in terms of\nreaction networks. This includes both networks inferred from\nexperimental data, as well as networks implicitly specified by for \nexample formal grammars.  We integrated experts\nin concurrency theory, in particular using process calculi, Petri\nnets, and related formal approaches.  State-of-the-art results in\nthese fields are hardly used to infer qualitative and/or quantitative\nproperties of chemical reaction systems, which are highly concurrent systems by\nnature. Most current modeling approaches in chemistry are either very\nabstract and aimed at formal algebraic properties of reaction\nnetworks, or use precise modeling on a very fine grained level such as the quantum mechanical one where\ncomputational costs prevent handling of more than a few molecules.  In  \nthis seminar we therefore seeked to advance discrete modeling\napproaches for Systems Chemistry.

            "data": "\n <p>\nOrganizations are complex systems that need to respond to a variety of changes while operating in a dynamic environment. They involve multiple stakeholders each having a domain-specific perspective that relies on concepts and languages relative to individual information-centric processes, which may lead to undesirable side-effects such as scattered and fractured knowledge about goals, strategies, operational processes etc. \n</p> \n <p>\nOrganizations are increasingly penetrated by software: Processes and resources are digitized, decision making relies on data provided by software systems, and transactions with external stakeholders are performed by machines. On the one hand, the omnipresence of digital systems creates the opportunity for further automation: The more structures and processes that constitute organizations are represented in software, the greater the scope for computer-supported management. On the other hand, this omnipresence creates a substantial challenge: Many organizations lack the competence to cope with the further increasing complexity of IT infrastructures. This includes the problem of assessing the business impact of IT investment and of assigning IT costs appropriately. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to these problems, organizations face a tremendous challenge: The digital transformation will eliminate many existing business models. It will enable new products and services and it may require organizations to substantially change the way they do business. Only, if organizations are prepared to cope with this challenge, will they be able to benefit from the digital transformation instead of suffering from it. \n</p> \n <p>\nA key aspect of the digital transformation is automation. While the potential for further automation through software is especially obvious in industrial production, other areas such as administrative work, management, and professional training are more and more dominated by machines. Therefore, there is need for new ways of supporting enterprise agility through the use of integrated computer-based systems\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar analyses how organizations can be supported not only with managing their resources and processes efficiently, but also with coping with the digital transformation, a topic which is subject of various research fields including: Management Science (a rationalist perspective); Organisational Studies (including Psychology and Sociology); Information Systems; Software Engineering (including modelling and meta-modelling, big-data and self-adaptive systems);  Requirements Engineering. Even though there is an obvious correspondence of foundational assumptions, there is hardly any exchange between these fields: an issue that the seminar aims to address.\n</p> \n <p>Against this background, the seminar is based on the following assumptions:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Organizations are prepared for change only if they account for the challenges related to adapting their software systems as well as the peculiarities of social change.\n</li><li> Research on organizational change in general, on designing organizational software systems in particular, recommends not only ideas of how to make organizations more efficient, but of how to make them a better place to work and live in. Otherwise it will be hardly possible to develop advanced conceptions of future organizations that may serve as an orientation for change. Without respective considerations efficiency remains a fairly meaningless concept.\n</li><li> Support for organizational efficiency and change recommends cross-disciplinary collaboration. While all three research streams outlined above focus on important aspects, none of them is sufficient on its own. \n</li><li>  Support for organisational decision making is currently very difficult due to the tacit nature of knowledge that must be reified and processed using advanced technologies.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Tony Clark, Ulrich Frank, and Vinay Kulkarni\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Real VR \u2013 Importing the Real World into Immersive VR and Optimizing the Perceptual Experience of Head-Mounted Displays",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar brought together 27 researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss the state-of-the-art, current challenges, as well as promising future research directions in Real VR. Real VR, as defined by the seminar participants, pursues two overarching goals: facilitating the import of real-world scenes into head-mounted displays (HMDs), and attaining perceptual realism in HMDs. The vision of Real VR is enabling to experience movies, concerts, even live sports events in HMDs with the sense of immersion of really \"being-there\", unattainable by today\u2019s technologies.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the welcome and overview session, the participants collectively decided on the seminar program  for the following days. In total, the seminar program included the overview session, three research presentation sessions, two breakout sessions including a demo track, two sessions for one-on-one discussions and individual exchange, one session for writing up the results, plus the summary and closing session.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo kick off the seminar, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung from Oculus VR presented the latest developments from an industrial perspective. He gave insights from the development of the just-released Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift S HMDs. In the research presentation sessions, 21 participants gave talks on their work. Participants also met in smaller groups in the breakout sessions to discuss the specific challenges of these fields in more detail. In due course, it became apparent that Real VR concerns research challenges in a number of different fields:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Capture\n</li><li>Reconstruction &amp; modeling\n</li><li>Rendering &amp; perception\n</li><li>Display technologies\n</li><li>Interaction &amp; virtual avatars\n</li><li>Production &amp; applications\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nSome exemplary results of the seminar on these topics were:\n</p> \n <p>\nThe persistent lack of consumer-market, i.e. affordable, mid- to high-resolution 360-degree video cameras to <b>capture</b> dynamic real-world scenes omnidirectionally still hamper research and development in Real VR. So far, research groups largely build their own custom-designed omnidirectional video cameras. Prominent examples include the omnidirectional camera designs by the group of Philippe Bekaert from Hasselt University, Belgium, and the top-of-the-line Manifold camera presented by Brian Cabral  from Facebook. Besides novel devices, also simpler recording methods are sought, e.g. by Tobias Bertel and Christian Richardt at Bath, in order to capture real-world content  more casually.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn <b>scene reconstruction and representation</b>, the jury is still out whether omnidirectional video should be considered to represent sparse light field data with dense depth/disparity as side information, or whether panoramic footage should (and could) be processed to provide full 3D geometry representations of the scene. As pointed out by Atanas Gotchev from TU Tampere, Marco Volino from the University of Surrey, and Christian Richardt from the University of Bath, both forms of representation have their respective advantages and drawbacks, e.g. when aiming to augment the real scene with additional virtual content.. Memory requirements and real-time streaming bandwidth requirements are challenging in either case.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe form of scene representation also determines which <b>rendering</b> approaches are viable. For 3D rendering, Dieter Schmalstieg from Graz presented his Shading Atlas Streaming approach to efficiently divide shading and rendering computation between server and client. To make use of visual <b>perception</b> characteristics in wide field-of-view HMDs, on the other hand, foveated rendering approaches, e.g. based on hardware ray tracing and accelerated machine learning, as presented by Anjul Patney from NVidia, have great potential. As shown by Qi Sun from Adobe, perceptual methods like saccade-aware rendering can also be used to enable walking through huge virtual worlds while actually not leaving the confines of one\u2019s living room. To render from dense depth-annotated 360-deg video, in contrast, advanced image-based warping methods and hole-filling approaches are needed, as was convincingly outlined by Tobias Bertel from the University of Bath.\n</p> \n <p>\nGordon Wetzstein from Stanford University presented how future HMDs will become even more realistic by overcoming current limitations of near-eye <b>displays</b>, in particular the vergence-accommodation conflict. Along similar lines, Hansung Kim from the University of Surrey showed how spatial audio enhances perceived VR realism even more.\n</p> <p>\nSocial <b>interaction</b> in the virtual world requires having digital doubles available. The elaborate steps needed to create convincing human avatars from real-world people were outlined by Feng Xu from Tsinghua University, Darren Cosker from the University of Bath, Christian Theobalt from MPII, and Peter Eisert from TU Berlin, covering the full range of human face, hand and body capture, reconstruction, and modeling. To interact with objects in virtual space, on the other hand, Erroll Wood from Microsoft Cambridge described how hand motion and gestures can be reliably tracked and identified in real-time by the upcoming HoloLens 2 device. Also based on real-time tracking, Li-Yi Wei from Adobe presented a system that enables presenters to augment their live presentation by interacting with the shown content in real-time using mere hand gestures and body postures.\n</p> \n <p>\nRegarding <b>content production and applications</b>, Christian Lipski from Apple presented the ARKit software framework developed for creating captivating augmented reality experiences. James Tompkin from Brown University presented work on multi-view camera editing of Real VR content during post-production. Johanna Pirker from TU Graz showed how virtual reality can be paired with human-computer interaction to enhance learning experiences in the physics classroom. Production aspects and cinematic VR experiences were also considered prominent drivers of contemporary Real VR research by other presenters, e.g. Marco Volino, Darren Cosker, Philippe Bekaert, Peter Eisert and Brian Cabral. \n</p> \n <p>\nPractically experiencing the new, tetherless Oculus Quest brought along by Alexander Sorkine-Hornung in the <b>demonstration track</b> made impressively clear how free, unrestricted user motion extends  the usability and acceptance of VR tremendously, made possible by the pass-through view feature of this HMD.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, in the coming months, a number of seminar participants will compile an edited book volume on the state-of-the-art in Real VR that Springer has already agreed to publish as part of their well-known Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS) Survey Series.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marcus A.

It had 40 participants, who were researchers\nin theoretical computer science, combinatorics, statistical mechanics and molecular biology. It was a geographically diverse group, with \nparticipants coming from the US, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France,  Switzerland,\nHungary, Australia, and  New Zealand. The workshop featured 21 talks, three of which were hourlong talks, and an open problem session. \n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral collaborative projects have been started. For example, Jay Pantone Michael Albert, Robert Brignall, Seth Pettie, and Vince Vatter started exploring the topic of 1324-avoiding permutations with a bounded number of descents, disproving a 2005 conjecture of Elder, Rechnitzer, and Zabrocki related to Davenport-Schinzel sequences. Had the conjecture been affirmed, it would have implied that the generating function for 1324-avoiding permutations is non-D-finite. \n</p> \n <p>\nAt the open problem session, \nYann Ponty raised the following question: what is the number of independent sets in restricted families of trees, like caterpillars or complete binary plane trees? The main motivation for this question relates to a deep connection between such independent sets and RNA designs. This question led to a new collaborative effort by Mathilde Bouvel, Robert Brignall, Yann Ponty and Andrew Elvey Price.\n</p> \n <p>\nSergi Elizalde and Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na have started working on Dyck paths that have a unique maximal peak. That collaboration\nsince extended to the area of probabilistic methods, involving a researcher working in that field, Douglas Rizzolo.\n</p> \n <p>\nNumerous participants expressed their pleasure with the workshop and its sequence of talks. The prevailing view was that\nwhile the participants came from three different fields, they were all open to the other two fields, and therefore, they all\nlearned about results that they would not have learned otherwise. Therefore, we have all the reasons to believe that the\nworkshop was a success, and we would like to repeat it some time in the future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na\n                </div> \n",

The organization of data profoundly influences the performance of accessing and manipulating data. By optimizing the way data is stored, performance can be improved by several orders of magnitude when data scales. This Dagstuhl seminar brought together researchers from several research directions to illuminate solutions to the scalability challenge of data structures. The seminar was the 14th in a series of loosely related Dagstuhl seminars on data structures. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic the\nseminar was purely virtual.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>\nThe presentations covered both advances in classic data structure fields, as well as insights addressing the scalability of computing for different models of computation.\n</p> \n <p>\nClassic data structure questions on dictionaries, hashing, filters, and heaps were the topic of several talks. Wild (Section 4.8) considered new pointer based search trees, Kozma (Section 4.24) discussed algorithms related to self-adjusting trees and heaps, Bercea (Section 4.4) presented results for dictionaries and filters, Even (Section 4.21) discussed dynamic stable\nperfect hashing, and Farach-Colton (Section 4.2) presented results for succinct stable hash tables. Johnson (Section 4.25) presented the vector quotient filter based on Robin Hood hashing and designed to exploit SIMD instructions. An external memory dictionary was presented by Conway (Section 4.20) who presented the SplinterDB key-value store for NVMe solid state drives.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor data structure problems on strings, G\u00f8rtz (Section 4.9) discussed the support for random access in compact representations of strings, and Starikovskaya (Section 4.22) dictionary look-ups with mismatches.\n</p> \n <p>\nData structures for storing and querying static and dynamic graphs were the topic of a sequence of talks. Pettie (Section 4.1) considered trade-offs between space usage and query time for supporting exact distance queries in planar graphs. Rotenberg (Section 4.5) considered planarity testing of dynamic graphs under the insertion and deletion of edges with polylogarithmic update time. Kopelowitz (Section 4.6) considered maintaining the orientation of edges in dynamic forests under the insertion of edges, guaranteeing low out\ndegree of all nodes. Henzinger (Section 4.16) presented an algorithm for maintaining a (\u0394+1)-vertex coloring of a graph with maximal degree \u0394 with constant time edge insertions and deletions. Bast (Section 4.27) gave a demonstration of an implementation of algorithms for real-time searching knowledge graphs with billions of edges.\n</p> \n <p>\nParallel algorithms for problems on graphs were addressed in multiple talks. Liu (Section 4.10) considered a parallel algorithm for counting triangles (cliques of size three) in graphs under batched updates of edge insertions and deletions, and Blelloch (Section 4.15) considered parallel batched dynamic algorithms for the minimum spanning tree and minimum cut problems. Sun (Section 4.13) considered a parallel algorithm for the single source shortest path problem using lazy batched priority queues. Shun (Section 4.3) considered a\nparallel index-based algorithm for graph clustering and an approximation algorithm using locality-sensitive hashing.\n</p> \n <p>\nComputational models supporting massive parallelism, like GPUs and TCUs, were\naddressed in talks by Owens (Section 4.11) who considered open-addressing hashing on GPUs, by Geil (Section 4.18) who consider how to solve the maximum clique problem on GPUs, and by Silvestri (Section 4.14) who addressed similarity search with tensor core units. Sitchinava &amp; Jacob (Section 4.19) in their joint talk, considered the power of the atomic and non-atomic versions of the parallel fork-join model.

Lincoln (Section 4.23) presented new techniques for proving fine-grained average-case hardness results, and Fagerberg (Section 4.26) considered the fragile complexity of adaptive algorithms. Finally, Driemel (Section 4.7) considered approximate-near-neighbor data structures for time series under the continuous Fr\u00e9chet distance.\n</p> \n <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> \n <p>The organizers would like to thank the Dagstuhl team for their continuous support and allowing this seminar to happen as a purely virtual Dagstuhl seminar. They also thank all participants for their contributions to this seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nPrevious seminars in the series had few female participants. A focus for this seminar was to significantly increase the female attendance. 50% of the invited participants were female, resulting in a 38% female attendance.\n</p> \n <p>\nEven though the seminar was challenged by the different time zones of the participants, on average 37 of the 48 participants participants attended the talks, and all talks were attended by at least 30 partcipants. In the post-seminar survey it was appreciated that the seminar took place as a virtual seminar instead of being cancelled, but it was also stated that the virtual format can never be as productive as an in-person seminar and showed how\nmuch we should appreciate the possibilities Dagstuhl offers under regular circumstances.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gerth St\u00f8lting Brodal, John Iacono, Markus E.

            "title": "Recent Advancements in Tractable Probabilistic Inference",
            "data": "\n <p>\nML models and systems to enable and support decision making in real-world scenarios need to robustly and effectively <em>reason in the presence of uncertainty</em> over the configurations of the world that can be observed.\n<em>Probabilistic inference</em> provides a principled framework to carry on this reasoning process, and enables probabilistic <em>modeling</em>: a collection of principles to design and learn from data models that are capable of dealing with uncertainty. The main purpose for these models, once learned or built, is to answer <em>queries</em> -- posed by humans or other autonomous systems -- concerning some aspects of the represented world and quantifying some form of uncertainty over it. That is, that is computing some quantity of interest of the probability distribution that generated the observed data.\nFor instance, the mean or the modes of such a distribution, the marginal or conditional probabilities of events, expected utilities of our policies, or decoding most likely assignments to variables (also known as MAP inference, cf. the Viterbi algorithm). Answering these queries reliably and efficiently is more important than ever: we need ML models and systems to perform inference based on well-calibrated uncertainty estimates throughout all reasoning steps, especially when informing and supporting humans in decision making processes in the real world.\n</p> \n <p>\nFor instance, consider a ML system learned from clinical data to support physicians and policy makers.\nSuch a system would need to support <em>arbitrary queries</em> posed by physicians, that is, questions that are not known a priori. \nMoreover, these queries might involve complex probabilistic reasoning\nover possible states of the world, for instance involving maximization of some probabilities and the ability to marginalize over unseen or not available (missing) attributes like \"At what age is a patient with this X-ray but no previous health record most likely to show <em>any</em> symptom of COVID-19?\", or counting and comparing sub-populations \"What is the probability of there being more cases with fever given a BMI of 25 in this county than in the neighboring one?\".\nAt the same time, it should guarantee that the uncertainty in its answers, modeled as probabilities, should be faithful to the real-world distribution as uncalibrated estimates might greatly mislead the decision maker.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent successes in machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning have delivered very expressive probabilistic models and learning algorithms.\nThese have proven to be able to induce exceedingly richer models from larger datasets but, \nunfortunately, at an incredible cost: these models are vastly <em>intractable</em> for all but the most trivial of probabilistic reasoning tasks, and they have been demonstrated to provide unreliable uncertainty estimations.\nIn summary, their applicability to real-world scenarios, like the one just described, is very limited.\n</p> \n <p>Nevertheless all these required \"ingredients\" are within the grasp of several models which we group together under the umbrella name of <em>tractable probabilistic models</em>, the core interest of this seminar. <em>Tractability</em> here guarantees answering queries <em>efficiently</em> and <em>exactly</em>.\nTractable probabilistic models (TPMs) have a long history rooted in several research fields such as classical probabilistic graphical models (low-treewidth and latent variable models), automated reasoning via knowledge compilation (logical and arithmetic circuits) and statistics (mixture models, Kalman filters).\nWhile these classical TPMs are known to be limited in expressiveness, several recent advancements in deep tractable models (sum-product networks, probabilistic sentential decision diagrams, normalizing flows and neural autoregressive models) are inverting the trend and promising tractable probabilistic inference with little or no compromise when compared to the deep generative models discussed above.\nIt becames then more and more important to have a seminar on these recent successes of TPMs bringing together the different communities of tractable probabilistic modeling at the same table to propel collaborations by defining the goals and the agenda for future research.\n</p> \n <p>These are the major topics around which the seminar brought up the aforementioned discussion:</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Advanced probabilistic query classes\n    </li><li> Deep tractable probabilistic modeling\n    </li><li> Robust and verifiable probabilistic inference\n    </li><li> Exploiting symmetries for probabilistic modelling and applications in science.\n    </li></ul> \n <h3>Advanced probabilistic query classes</h3> \n <p>\nProbabilistic inference can be reduced as computing probabilistic queries, i.e., functions whose output are certain properties of a probability distribution (e.g., its mass, density, mean, mode, etc.) as encoded by a probabilistic model.\nProbabilistic queries can be grouped into classes when they compute the same distributional properties and hence share the same computational effort to be answered.\nAmong the most commonly used query classes there are complete evidence (EVI), marginals (MAR), conditionals (CON) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference.\nWhile these classes have been extensively investigated in theory and practice, they constitute a small portion of the probabilistic inference that might be required to support complex decision making in the real-world.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn fact, one might want to compute the probabilities of logical and arithmetic constraints, of structured objects such as rankings, comparing the likelihood and counts of groups of events or computing the expected predictions of discriminative model such as a classifier or regression w.r.t. some feature distribution.\nTracing the exact boundaries of tractable probabilistic inference for these advanced probabilistic query classes and devising probabilistic models delivering efficient and reliable inference for them is an open challenge.\n</p> \n <h3>Deep tractable probabilistic modeling</h3> \n <p>\nA probabilistic model falls under the umbrella name of tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) if it guarantees exact and polytime inference for certain query classes.\nAs different model classes can be tractable representations for different query classes, a <em>spectrum</em> of tractable inference emerges.\nTypically, this create a tension with the extent of a model class supporting a larger set of tractable query classes, and its <em>expressive efficiency</em>, i.e., the set of functions it can represent compactly.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecent deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), regularized and variational autoencoders (VAEs) fall out of the TPM umbrella because they either have no explicit likelihood model or computing even the simplest class of queries, EVI, is hard in general.\nIn fact, despite their successes, their inference capabilities are severely limited and one has to recur to approximations.\nHowever, the approximate inference routines available so far (such as the evidence lower bound and its variants) do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees on the quality of the approximation delivered to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios.  \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the other hand, classical TPMs from the probabilistic graphical model community support larger classes of tractable queries comprising MAR, CON and MAP (to different extents based on the model class).\nAmong these there are: i) low or bounded-treewidth probabilistic graphical models that exchange expressiveness for efficiency; \nii) determinantal point processes which allow tractable inference for distributions over sets;\niii) graphical models with high girth or weak potentials, that provide bounds on the performance of approximate inference methods; \nand iv) exchangeable probabilistic models that exploit symmetries to reduce inference complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nA different prospective on tractability is brought by models compiling inference routines into efficient computational graphs such as arithmetic circuits, sum-product networks, cutset networks and probabilistic sentential decision diagrams have advanced the state-of-the-art inference performance by exploiting context-specific independence, determinism or by exploiting latent variables. \nThese TPMs, as well as many classical tractable PGMs as listed above, can be cast under a unifying framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs), abstracting from the different graphical formalisms of each model.\nPCs with certain structural properties support tractable MAR, CON, MAP as well as some of the advanced query classes touched in the previous topic item.  Guy Van den Broeck gave a long talk on the first day of the seminar to set the stage for participants for viewing tractable probabilistic models from the lens of probabilistic circuits.\n</p> \n <p>\nMore recently, the field of neural density estimators has gained momentum in the tractable probabilistic modeling community.\nThis is due to model classes such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models.\nAutoregressive models and flows retain the expressiveness of GANs and VAEs, by levering powerful neural representations for probability factors or invertible transformations, \nwhile overcoming their limitations and delivering tractable EVI queries.\nAs such, they position themselves in the spectrum of tractability in an antithetic position w.r.t. PCs: while the latter support more tractable query classes, the former are generally more expressive. On the first day of the seminar, Marcus Brubaker introduced these models to the seminar participants in a long talk.\nIt is an interesting open challenge to combine TPM models from different regions of such a spectrum to leverage the \"best of different worlds\", i.e., increase a model class expressive efficiency while retaining the largest set of supported tractable query classes as possible. The first day subsequently ended with a lively open discussion on the differences between TPMs and Neural Generative Models and what advantages and lessons they can provide the other models.\n</p> \n <h3>Robust and verifiable probabilistic inference</h3> \n <p>Along exactness and efficiency, one generally requires inference routines to be robust to adversarial conditions (noise, malicious attacks, etc.) and to be allow exactness and efficiency to be formally provable.\nThis is crucial to deploy reliable probabilistic models in real-world scenarios (cf. other topic).\nRecent advancements in learning tractable and intractable probabilistic models from data have raised the question if the learned models are just exploiting spurious correlations in input space, thus ultimately delivering an unfaithful image of the probability distribution they try to encode.\nThis raises several issues, as in tasks like anomaly detection and model comparison, which rely on correctly calibrated probabilities, one can be highly mislead by such unfaithful probabilistic models.\nFurthermore, one might want to verify a priori or ex-post (e.g., in presence of adversarial interventions) if one probabilistic inference algorithm truly guarantees exact inference.\nQuestions like this have just very recently been tackled in a formal verification setting, where\nproofs of the correctness of inference can be verified with less resources than it takes to execute inference.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the course of the seminar, through informal discussions and formal talks by the participants discussed the above mentioned issues in tractable probabilistic inference through topics such as Bayesian Deep Learning, Incorporating symmetries in probabilistic modelling using equivariance with applications in sciences, explainable AI etc.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the seminar produced numerous insights into how efficient, expressive, flexible, and robust tractable probabilistic models can be built. Specially, the discussions and talks at the seminar spurred a renewed interest in the community to:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> develop techniques and approaches that bring together key ideas from several different fields that include deep generative models, probabilistic circuits, knowledge compilation, and approximate inference. \n</li><li> create bridges between researchers in these different fields and identify ways in which enhanced interaction between the communities can continue.\n</li><li> generate a set of goals, research directions, and challenges for researchers in these field to develop robust and principled probabilistic models.\n</li><li> provide a unified view of the current undertakings in these different fields towards probabilistic modelling and identifying ways to incorporate ideas from several fields together.\n</li><li> develop a new systematic and unified set of development tools encompassing these different areas of probabilistic modelling.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Priyank Jaini, Kristian Kersting, Antonio Vergari, and Max Welling\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Scalable Handling of Effects",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAlgebraic effects and effect handlers are currently enjoying significant interest in both academia and industry as a modular programming abstraction for expressing and incorporating user-defined computational effects in programming languages. For example, there are a number of effect handler oriented languages in development (such as Eff, Frank, and Koka); there exist effect handler libraries for mainstream languages (such as C and Java); effect handlers are a key part of languages such as Multicore OCaml (and indeed they are due to appear in the production release of OCaml next year); effect handlers are being increasingly used in statistical probabilistic programming (such as Uber's Pyro tool); and proposals are in the works to include effect handlers in new low-level languages (such as WebAssembly). While effect handlers have solid mathematical foundations and have been extensively experimented in prototype languages and on smaller examples, enabling effect handlers to scale still requires tackling some hard problems. To this end, this Dagstuhl Seminar 21292 \"Scalable Handling of Effects\" focused on addressing the following key problem areas for scalability: Safety, Modularity, Interoperability, Legibility, and Efficiency.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar followed the earlier successful Dagstuhl Seminars 16112 \"From Theory to Practice of Algebraic Effects and Handlers\" and 18172 \"Algebraic Effect Handlers go Mainstream\", which were respectively dedicated to the foundations of algebraic effects and to the introduction of them into mainstream languages. In contrast to these previous two seminars which took place in person at Schloss Dagstuhl, the current seminar was organised fully online due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As the seminar was attended by participants from a wide range of time zones (ranging from the West coast of the US all the way to Japan), coming up with a schedule that was suitable for everybody was a challenge. In the end, we decided to have three scheduled two-hour sessions each day, with impromptu informal discussions also happening between-times. These sessions were: (i) 15:00-17:00 CEST, which were deemed the Core Hours, where all participants were most likely to be able to present; (ii) 10:00-12:00 CEST, which was most suitable for participants from Asia and Europe; and (iii) 17:30-19:30 CEST, which was most suitable for participants from America and Europe. The Core Hours included talks, breakouts, and discussions of interest to the widest audience, with more specialised talks and breakouts taking place in the other two daily scheduled blocks. Talks were recorded so that participants could catch up due to being in an incompatible time zone, then deleted at the end of the week.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to run a successful virtual Dagstuhl seminar we exploited several different technologies. For talks we used Zoom. For breakouts we used a combination of Zoom and Gather.town, and for asynchronous communication and further discussions we used Zulip. For scheduling purposes, we used the wiki page provided by Dagstuhl.\n\nWe collected initial lists of proposed talks and breakout topics before the seminar began using an online form. We extended these throughout the week. We scheduled talks and breakout groups daily depending on audience interest and the participant availability. While the first part of the week was dominated by talks, the second part of the week saw more emphasis on breakouts and discussions. During Friday's Core Hours, the leaders of each breakout group presented a short overview of the discussions and results (11 reports in total). Initially, we were a little unsure about how well breakout sessions would work in a virtual seminar, but as the week went on they became more and more popular and they seemed to go remarkably well. Initially, we mostly used Gather.town and its virtual whiteboards for the breakout sessions. Subsequently, we transitioned to mostly using Zoom breakout rooms (partly because some people had difficulty using Gather.town on their systems). \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was a great success, particularly given the constraints of the virtual format.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere were vibrant discussions around multishot continuations. These are vital for exciting new applications such as probabilistic programming and automatic differentiation, but more research is needed on how to implement them safely and efficiently in different contexts. Flipping perspective, it was mooted that for certain applications, particularly those involving direct interaction with the external world, it might be worthwhile restricting attention to runners, which are even more constrained than effect handlers with singleshot continuations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere were several discussions relating to usability of effect handlers. These resulted in proposals to design a lecture course on effect handlers and to write a book on how to design effectful programs.\n</p> \n <p>\nA major area of interest instigated at a prior Dagstuhl Seminar (18172 \"Algebraic Effect Handlers go Mainstream\") is the addition of effect handlers to WebAssembly. A design is being actively worked on as part of the official WebAssembly development process. At the current seminar we worked out extensions to the existing proposal to accommodate named effect handlers and symmetric stack-switching, both of which promise more efficient execution.\n</p> \n <p>\nAn issue with many existing benchmarks for effect handlers is that they often require installing a range of experimental software and configuring it with just the right settings. In order to make it easier to compare systems and share experimental setups we created the effect handlers benchmarks suite -- a repository of benchmarks and systems covering effects and handlers in various programming languages, based on Docker scripts that make it easy for anyone to run the benchmarks and adapt them for their own research. The repository is hosted on GitHub. Since the seminar, 5 systems have been added to the repository and it has been actively updated and maintained by different members of the community.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the end of the week, there was strong interest among the participants to continue this successful seminar series and submit a proposal for another incarnation, hopefully possible to take place on site in about two years.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Danel Ahman, Amal Ahmed, Sam Lindley, and Andreas Rossberg\n                </div> \n",

This technology opens manifold opportunities to redesign Business-to-Business (B2B) collaborations in a wide range of fields, including supply chain, logistics, service agreements, healthcare, and Industry 4.0. Importantly, it can enable substantial efficiency gains in terms of cost and time it takes to set-up and perform collaborative processes, particularly in settings where there is a lack of trust between the parties involved in the collaboration. Traditionally, collaborative processes are executed by relying on trusted third-party providers such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) hubs or escrows. This centralized architecture creates entry barriers and hinders bottom-up innovation. Blockchains and smart contracts enable these processes to be executed in a distributed manner without delegating trust to central authorities nor requiring mutual trust between each pair of parties. Further, blockchain enables fine-grained access control, thus allowing multiple parties to selectively share their data with each other and to selectively grant permissions to perform transactions on these data. \n</p> \n <p>\nWhile blockchain opens up new possibilities, it also raises a number of challenges because it requires us to re-think the way B2B collaborations are designed and implemented. In contrast to centralized collaborative processes, the transparent and decentralized nature of blockchains brings in new challenges related to compliance, control, and privacy, in addition to major scalability and performance challenges.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe primary goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together experts in I/O performance, file systems, and storage, and collectively explore the space of current and future problems and solutions for I/O on hierarchical storage systems. We had a lively week of learning about each other\u2019s approaches as well as unique I/O use cases that can influence the design of a community-driven file and storage system standards. We also engaged in several informal, in-depth discussions on questions surrounding how we should best move forward in the I/O and storage community. \n</p> \n <p>\nA portion of agenda for this meeting was partitioned into sessions containing short talks. The short talk sessions were grouped into high level topic areas: high performance computing and storage systems today; user needs for I/O; user level file system implementations; object stores and alternatives; and file systems building blocks. The intention behind the short talks was to acquaint the attendees with each other's work and to inspire further discussions. Following each talk topic, we had panel-style discussions with the talk speakers serving as the panel. In these panel-style discussions, the audience had the opportunity to ask questions about the speakers' talks as well as note and discuss commonalities and differences across the presentations. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe remainder of the agenda for the meeting was reserved for open discussions with the entire group. The participants engaged in lengthy discussions on various questions that arose from the talks. Additionally, participants were encouraged to propose and vote for discussion topics on a white board. The proposed topics with the most votes were included in the agenda. The in-depth discussion topics included: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How are stage-in and stage-out operations actually going to work?\n</li><li> How can we fairly judge the performance of storage systems - IO 500?\n</li><li> What is a user-level file system? What do we mean when we say that?\n</li><li> How can we characterize what users need from storage systems?\n</li><li> Are we ready to program to a memory hierarchy versus block devices? \n</li><li> and What should we do about POSIX?\n</li></ul> \n <p>The combination of short talks and open discussions resulted in a fruitful meeting. Since the work of the participants was not necessarily familiar to all, the short talks provided a foundation for getting everyone oriented with each other's efforts. Once that was achieved, we were able to productively dive into the informal topic discussions. Overall, several common themes emerged from the talks and discussions. The participants agreed that these themes were important to address to meet the needs of HPC applications on next-generation storage systems. We include these themes in this report in Section 9 to serve as  suggestions for further investigations.\n</p> \n <h3>Report Organization</h3> \n <p>\nHere we present an overview of the topics in this report to guide the reader. Our goal in this report is to capture as much information as possible from the seminar so that those who could not attend can benefit from the talks and discussions.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe detail the short talk sessions in Sections 3-7. First, we provide a summary of the notes from the session note taker and other comments from the talks and panel discussions. Following this summary we provide a listing of each talk in the session and its abstract.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn Sections 8.1-8.6 we give summaries of the informal discussion sessions. The summaries in this case are in outline format in order to capture the conversational and informal nature of the sessions. In many cases, the discussions drew out many interesting questions instead of clear paths forward, so the outline format captured this well.\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing the summaries of the sessions, in Section 9 we conclude with a discussion of recurring themes, including issues for future discussion and work, that occurred during the meeting. We feel that these themes are the true product of this meeting and can serve as a foundation for future meetings or other community efforts.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andr\u00e9 Brinkmann, Kathryn Mohror, and Weikuan Yu\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Symmetric Cryptography",
            "data": "\n <p>\nIT Security plays an increasingly crucial role in everyday life and business. Virtually all modern security solutions are based on cryptographic\nprimitives. Symmetric cryptography deals with the case where both the sender and the receiver of a message use the same key.\nDue to their good performance, symmetric cryptosystems are highly relevant not only for academia, but also for industrial activities.\nWe identified the following areas as some of the most important topics on symmetric cryptography at the moment.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Lessons Learnt from NIST Lightweight Cryptography Project.</b> The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) acknowledged in 2013 the real-world importance of lightweight cryptography,\nand announced an initiative for standardization. It is expected that the new lightweight standard will not only be used in the US,\nbut rather worldwide.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>New Design Strategies.</b> This area deals with the development of symmetric cryptographic primitives and modes that must\noperate for specific applications, such as STARKs, SNARKs, fully homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation.\nThese novel applications lead to a paradigm shift in design criteria that we are just starting to understand,\nboth in terms of possible optimizations as well as security impacts.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Quantum-Safe Symmetric Cryptography.</b> For symmetric cryptography, it is short-sighted to expect that cryptanalysis will not\nimprove with the help of quantum computers in the future. It is of importance to understand both the possibility to quantize existing\nclassical attacks, as well as the possibility to perform new types of cryptanalytic attacks using a quantum computer.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Understanding Security Implications from Ideal and Keyless Primitives.</b> Permutation-based cryptography has gained astounding\npopularity in the last decade, and security proofs are performed in an ideal permutation model. Partly as a consequence of this,\nthe concrete security analysis of the involved primitives has become more difficult. One challenge is to understand\n(i) to what extent distinguishers impact the security of cryptographic schemes and (ii) what non-random properties of permutations seem\nlikely to be translated into an attack on the full scheme.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar program consisted of a few short presentations and in-depth group meetings.\nPresentations were about the above topics and other relevant areas of symmetric cryptography,\nincluding state-of-the-art cryptanalytic techniques and new designs. Below one can find the list of abstracts for talks given during the seminar. \nThe research groups were on various topics in symmetric cryptography, all related to one of the above points in one way or another.\nOn the last day of the seminar, the leaders of each group gave brief summaries of achievements.\nSome teams continued working on the topic after the seminar and started new research collaborations.\nHere are the summaries of the five groups: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Group 1 worked and discussed on various problems of provable security, roughly corresponding to one project per person.\nFor three of the projects, the groups had preliminary discussions, and the next step will be to perform the remaining research and\ninvestigate the details offline. For two problems, namely improved unforgeability of certain MAC constructions and generic analysis\nof PRF\u2019s and MAC\u2019s on 2 public permutations, they advanced quite well and the details will be written down soon after the seminar.\n</li><li> Group 2 worked on several topics that they plan to continue after the seminar. One was to find good algorithms for detecting \nthe optimal trees of some Boolean functions in the context of improved key-recovery attacks, and figuring out if we actually need trees,\nor if we could find or use better partitions that do not correspond to a tree and yet improve the complexity. They also worked on building \ntwo attacks on the HALFLOOP construction. They solved the problem of finding structures in linear layers and of decomposing them, \nand they applied this to Streebog. They also continued developing a new cryptanalysis family; differential meet-in-the-middle attacks. \nThey figured out how to correctly combine it with bicliques, and started working on an application on the construction of SKINNY, \nwhich should be comparable if not better than the best known attacks.\n</li><li> Group 3 worked on several topics related to cryptanalysis, that they plan to continue after the seminar. The studied Tweakable Twine,\na tweakable variant of Twine proposed in 2019. They looked at impossible differential distinguishers,\nbut unfortunately they were not able to cover more rounds than in previous work. They also looked at the differential\npropagation of the cipher. They were able to find a distinguisher that would be established with a probability of 2^{-61},\nand they rediscovered a 24-round zero correlation attack in Twine. They have also pointed out several observations on TinyJAMBU,\nincluding a method to break the P_b permutation (for 384 rounds) if one can observe collisions during the processing phase.\nThey looked at a paper from 2016 on KATAN that searches for extended boomerang distinguishers. They are implementing the attacks to observe\nthe impact of the middle-round dependencies experimentally. Finally, they looked at (free-start) collisions on Romulus-H and tried to find\ndifferential characteristics that are suitable to be used in two SKINNY invocations. One idea would be to use the dependencies to have a\ncollision of a higher probability. \n</li><li>Group 4 has worked on integral distinguishers on big finite fields. After looking at different topics, this group focused in the\nfollowing problem: can we find integral distinguishers from the knowledge of some properties of the univariate representation of a\nfunction F: \ud835\udd3d_2\u207f \u2192 \ud835\udd3d_2\u207f? In other words, they wanted to find some coefficients (\u03bb\u2080, \u2026, \u03bb_{2\u207f-1}) in \ud835\udd3d_2\u207f such that \u2200 x, \u2211_{i = 0}^{2\u207f-1} \u03bb_i F(\u03b1\u2071 X) = 0.\nIn the particular case where all \u03bb_i \u2208 \ud835\udd3d_2\u207f, this corresponds to finding sets of inputs such that the corresponding outputs sum to zero.\nThey proved that \u2211_{i = 0}^{2\u207f-1} \u03bb_i F(\u03b1\u2071 X) does not contain any term of degree \ud835\udcc1 if and only if A_\ud835\udcc1 = 0 or P(\u03b1^\ud835\udcc1) = 0 where\nF(X) = \u2211_{i = 0}^{2\u207f-1} A_i X\u2071 = 0. Therefore, they aimed at finding polynomials P which vanish on all \u03b1^\ud835\udcc1 when i varies in a given set,\nand which have the smallest possible number of terms. Indeed, the number of terms of P is the data complexity of the distinguisher.\nWhen the only information we have on F is that A_i = 0 for all i of weight \u2265 d, then the polynomial P with binary coefficients and with the\nsmallest weight corresponds to the usual distinguisher obtained with higher-order differentials, i.e., rot(P) = 2^d. However,\nif we have more information on A_i, then we can obtain distinguishers with lower data complexity than expected.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nils Gregor Leander, Bart Mennink, Maria Naya-Plasencia, and Yu Sasaki\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Managing Industrial Control Systems Security Risks for Cyber Insurance",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe security economics community has an ambivalent position on quantifying cyber risk: on the one hand, there is a long-standing interest in establishing cyber risk measurement, while on the other hand, relevant publications report contradictory results [7] or present models with insufficient evidence of validity [6]. As researchers remain cautious about the interpretation of modeling results, the insurance industry\u2019s need for gaining a quantitative understanding of cyber risk is more critical than ever. A serious concern for insurers is that a large-scale cyberattack could result in significant claims arising from transferred security risks. Considering the adverse business implications of cyber-related high-impact, low-frequency events, it is necessary to estimate and control the potential exposure to such losses. Previous industry studies attempted to address this issue by proposing hypothetical worst-case scenarios\ninvolving power grids [8], ports [9], and other industrial applications [4]. Furthermore, several industry-led working groups conducted workshops to assess the plausibility, impact, and claim implications of potential ICS-related catastrophic loss events (cf., for instance, [10, 11, 5, 12]). However, it is still not fully understood how the peculiarities of ICSs, technological change\nin light of strategic initiatives (e.g., Industry 4.0 [3]), and the increasingly sophisticated nature of cyber-physical attacks influence the loss frequency and loss severity [1]. Moreover, a holistic consideration of cyber-physical risk featuring the complete ICS lifecycle calls for an interdisciplinary research approach [2].\n</p> \n <p>Thus, the aim of this Dagstuhl seminar was to bring together different communities to foster research activities that advance the understanding of cyber risks pertaining to ICSs and associated insurance aspects. The concepts developed as part of this seminar are a result of interdisciplinary work conducted by academics and industry professionals, both junior and senior, from the fields of<br/>\n<b>(i)</b>computer science,<br/>\n<b>(ii)</b> automation engineering,<br/>\n<b>(iii)</b> actuarial science, and<br/>\n<b>(iv)</b> economics.<br/>\n</p> \n <p>\nTo address the issues outlined above, the purpose of the seminar was to make the first steps toward a probabilistic cyber catastrophe model that is tailored to the ICS domain. In particular, we planned to achieve the basis of an economic loss model that builds upon worst-case scenarios in which globally and simultaneously many industrial processes in critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., power, petrochemical, transport, logistics) are affected by\ncyber-attacks. Figure 1 visualizes possible components of such a model, which were discussed and challenged during the seminar. In the first phase, the scenario is formulated, fundamental assumptions are specified, and the theoretical basis of the statistical model is formed. After that, the model is calibrated with data obtained from various sources, such as loss databases\nor subject-matter experts. Finally, the model and its underlying assumptions are validated.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4925/Method_8.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/> <caption><b>Figure 1</b> Potential components of a probabilistic cyber catastrophe model for the ICS domain (adapted from materials provided by SCOR SE)</caption> \n <p>\nTo set the frame for the seminar, the organizers defined four topics that were covered in plenary sessions and breakout sessions. In each plenary session, lightning talks were held that motivated the collaborative work in the breakout sessions. The working groups studied the same overarching topic of the breakout session (yet each with a different focus) in order to strengthen interdisciplinary exchange.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, the following topics and motivating research questions were addressed:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><em>ICS Threat Landscape:</em> How have cyber attacks against ICSs evolved and what should we expect in terms of attack sophistication, persistence, and impact in the future?\n</li><li><em>Cyber-Physical Risk Quantification:</em> How can we quantitatively model economic losses caused by ICS-focused cyber risks (i.e., probabilistic cyber catastrophe model)?\n</li><li><em>Insurance:</em> What are the opportunities and limitations of transferring ICS-focused cyber risks to insurers?\n</li><li><em>Management of Security Risks:</em> Which hard (e.g., technological security measures) and soft (e.g., information sharing, regulations, funding) factors increase or reduce the attack likelihood and severity?\n</li></ol> \n <p>The seminar started with a welcome session to bridge the disciplinary gap. In this session, the organizers presented the seminar program, explained key terms, and discussed core concepts to familiarize attendees with the terminologies used by different communities. Over the following days, several participants gave lightning talks that focused on the following topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>cyber-physical systems, security-relevant aspects within their lifecycle, and procurement considerations,\n</li><li> current ICS security challenges with an emphasis on technological trends (e.g., Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, Industrial Internet of Things),\n</li><li>  cyber-physical risk assessments, where special attention was given to analysis and quantification methods, \n</li><li> various aspects of (cyber) insurance (e.g., cyber cat modeling, underwriting, economic problems, regulations), and\n</li><li> security economics, featuring studies on cybercrime analysis and vulnerability forecasting.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The lightning talks gave participants the opportunity to present new perspectives and challenges, which led to lively discussions that shaped the group sessions. Unfortunately, the restrictions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic made it not possible to conduct the estimation exercises with all participants, which would have been required for achieving the cyber cat model. However, conducting the seminar in a hybrid format still enabled the participants both on-site and remote to work together on challenging open questions, contribute to group discussions, and forge new research collaborations.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers thank all participants for their valuable contribution. Furthermore, this seminar would not have been possible without the great technical support provided by the Schloss Dagstuhl staff and the considerable effort made by the video conferencing assistants Sejdefa Ibisevic, Markus Maier, and Sara Tajik.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Matthias Eckhart, Bernhard Brenner, Andreas Ekelhart, and Edgar Weippl.

            "title": "Mobility Data Science",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMobility data is typically available in the form of sequences of location points with time stamps, that are generated by location tracking devices. The use of mobility data has traditionally been linked to transportation industry. Nowadays, with the availability of GPS-equipped mobile devices and other inexpensive location tracking technologies, mobility data is collected and published ubiquitously, leading to large data sets of volunteered geographic information (VGI). \n</p> \n <p>\nIn general, mobility data science is the science of transforming mobility data into (actionable) knowledge. This knowledge is critical towards solutions for traffic management, disease pandemic mitigation, micro-mobility (e.g., shared bikes and scooters), health monitoring, logistics (e.g., delivery services), to mention a few.  \n</p> \n <p>\nDespite the common goal of acquiring, managing, and generating insights from mobility data, the mobility data science community is largely fragmented, developing solutions in silos. It stems from a range of disciplines with expertise in moving object data storage and management, geographic information science, spatiotemporal data mining, ubiquitous computing, computational geometry and more. Furthermore, there is a disconnect in both industry and science between mobility data scientists and domain scientists or end users for which solutions are designed. Therefore, the goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together and recognize the mobility data science community as an interdisciplinary research field, strengthen the definition of mobility data science, and together explore challenges and opportunities in the field.  The seminar had two objectives: (1) to build a new research community of mobility data science as amalgamation of the several communities who have been looking at mobility data, and (2) to draft a research agenda for mobility data science. This dagstuhl seminar was the first towards these objectives. The consensus of the participants is that more events will be needed in the future to continue the community building effort. \n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>The seminar was held in the week of January 9 -- 14 , 2022. It had 47 participants specialized in different topics: data management, mobility analysis, geography, privacy, urban computing, systems, simulation, indoors, visualization, information integration, and theory. Due to COVID-19, the seminar took place in hybrid mode, with 8 onsite, and 39 remote participants. Despite the challenge of different time zones of the participants, all sessions were attended by at least 37 participants. \n</p> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0004/4969/program.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Dagstuhl Seminar on Mobility Science - Program.\" src=\"/storage/media/0004/4970/program.png\" width=\"100%\"/></a> \n <caption>Figure 1 Dagstuhl Seminar on Mobility Science -- Program.</caption> \n <p>\nThe seminar program is given in Figure 1. In the first day, every participant gave a\nfive-minutes self introduction, research interests, and position statement on mobility data\nscience. The rest of the program consisted of panels, and open discussions. To work around\nthe time zone challenge, the seminar activities were centered in the afternoon of Dagstuhl,\nwhich was still possible for the Eastern and CHN time zones. The open discussions slots were\nplanned ad-hoc during the seminar. In particular, the slot on Tuesday was used to define\nwhat is mobility data science, or more precisely what is the scope of work of this community.\n</p> \n <p>\nAll working group and panel discussions were moderated to converge towards the seminar\ngoals of defining a research agenda and building a community. The results are summarized\nin this report.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization and Panels</h3> \n <p>To accommodate for the hybrid mode and the time zone differences, we opted to let the\nparticipants choose to participate in one of the following three thematic working groups,\neach having 14-17 members and led by one of the seminar co-organizers:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Seminar co-organizers:</b> Mohamed Mokbel, Mahmoud Sakr, Li Xiong, Andreas Z\u00fcfle\n</li><li><b>Working Group 1:</b> Mobility Data Acquisition and Privacy<br/>\nThe scope includes the full cycle of obtaining and preparing mobility data for further\nprocessing.

            "title": "Secure Composition for Hardware Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nToday's electronic systems consist of mixtures of programmable, reconfigurable and application-specific hardware components, tied together by tremendously complex software. At the same time, systems are increasingly integrated such that a system that was traditionally regarded \"harmless'' (<em>e.g.</em>, an entertainment system in a car) finds itself tightly coupled with safety-critical driving-assistance systems and security-sensitive online payment systems. Moreover, a system's hardware components are now often directly accessible to the users, making the system vulnerable to physical attacks via its hardware which becomes the system's \"Achille's heel\".  This necessitates a new look on system security from hardware perspective.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar \"Secure Composition for Hardware Systems\", which took place on July 21-26, 2019, focused on secure composition of systems which contain hardware blocks. This is a practically important but a theoretically challenging problem where several foundational questions still lack an adequate answer.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral formats were used during the seminar. The first phase of the seminar, which focused on prior findings, started with presentations by five pre-selected experts giving their view on secure composition from different perspectives: theory, design automation, trusted execution environments and attacks countermeasures. Then, small-group discussions of relevant state of the art were held, focusing on questions such as \"What does it mean to securely compose two elements?\" or \"What is the role of models in secure composition?\" The findings of the small groups were intensively discussed in plenary sessions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe second phase of the seminar was devoted to discussing research questions. Some of the questions were prepared by the seminar organizers (<em>e.g.</em>, \"Which protocol-level secure composition methods are applicable in hardware domain?\" or \"How to counter possible loss of security due to abstraction of hardware components?\") and some additional questions were proposed by the participants (<em>e.g.</em>, \"How to bootstrap trust in a distributed hardware system?\"). The questions were discussed again in small groups, intertwined by individual presentations in plenum (for instance, an in-depth study on the applicability of Universal Composability (UC) in the hardware domain).\n</p> \n <p>\nTwo immediate outcomes grew out of the seminar. First, some participants are\norganizing a special session on secure compositions in one of the leading scientific conferences; a respective proposal was recently accepted by the \"Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference\" (DATE). Second, there is an ambitious plan to prepare a manuscript on the full variety of aspects in secure composition of electronic systems and submit it as a \"Systematization of Knowledge\" (SoK) paper to the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&amp;P); this effort is ongoing at the time of writing this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, we believe that this seminar has provided entirely new insights to most of the participants and has opened new avenues for research on the intersection of security and hardware systems. It brought together researchers from communities who rarely interacted with each other in the past. The seminar helped define new research challenges, and activities are underway to put the topic of secure composition higher on the agenda of the respective communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers are thankful to the Dagstuhl team (and in particular to Dr. Andreas Dolzmann who handled the scientific part and Mrs. Heike Clemens who was of invaluable help in organizing the social event and masterly handled all practical issues); to Dr. Elif Bilge Kavun who did a great job in collecting and organizing the documents from participants and in preparing the summarizing texts; and to all the participants for making this seminar a success.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ilia Polian, Divya Arora, Francesco Regazzoni, and Patrick Schaumont\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Wildly Heterogeneous Post-CMOS Technologies Meet Software",
            "data": "\n <h3>Topic and Structure</h3> \n <p>\nThe end of exponential scaling in conventional CMOS technologies has been forecasted for many years by now. While advances in fabrication made it possible to reach limits beyond those predicted, the so anticipated end seems to be imminent today. An indication of this is the research boom, both in academia and industry, in emerging technologies that could complement or even replace CMOS devices. Examples for such emerging technologies include tunnel FETs, nonvolatile memories such as magnetoresistive RAM, 3D integration, carbon nanotube transistors, and graphene.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of this seminar was to discuss bridges between material research, hardware components and, ultimately, software for information processing systems. Given a new class of wildly heterogeneous systems that integrate different technologies, we want to reason about enabling hardware and software abstractions, from languages and system-software down to hardware mechanisms. The challenge of realizing an efficient wildly heterogeneous system can only be tackled by employing holistic and synergistic approaches in an interdisciplinary environment. By bringing together experts from the individual fields and also researchers working interdisciplinarily across fields, the seminar helped to foster a mutual understanding about the challenges of advancing computing beyond current CMOS technology and to create long-term visions about a future hardware/software stack.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was structured around four partially overlapping areas, namely: (i) far-fetched materials and physics such as spin, nanomagnets, phase transition, and correlated phenomena, (ii) near future materials (and software) such as phase-change memory, nanowires, nanotubes, and neuromorphic devices, (iii) low-level software layers for new technologies such as operating systems, runtime support, middleware, and HW/SW-co-designed firmware, and (iv) upper software layers such as new programming/specification languages, models, and software synthesis.\n</p> \n <p>Important questions addressed by the seminar included:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Materials/Devices: What are the current status and the roadmap of post-CMOS materials and technologies? What will be the expected characteristics of the new devices? Will new technologies enable a fundamentally different computing paradigm, e.g., beyond von Neumann? What are the challenges for proper benchmarking of different technologies?\n</li><li>Hardware/Software Stack: How much of the hardware's heterogeneity and its characteristics should be exposed to programmers? How general may be a programming model/language for future (yet unknown) hardware? How to make software adapt itself to hardware with fluctuating resources? Which new applications can be enabled by emerging materials and technologies and what needs to be done at the software layers to make them viable?\n</li><li>Analysis: How can we model the interactions across the layers of the hardware/software stack? What kind of formal operational models and analysis methods are needed for evaluating heterogeneous systems? Can system-level analysis of new technologies give insights to material scientists, disrupting the otherwise incremental innovation paradigm?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Main Conclusions</h3> \n <h4>Summary</h4> \n <p>There will probably be no CMOS replacement for chips with billions of transistors in the next 20 years, but architectural advances at various levels (such as 3D transistors, 3D integration of memory and logic, specialization, and reconfigurability) will lead to performance improvements despite the scaling limitations of planar CMOS technology. New non-volatile memories (e.,g., spin-based) bear the potential to radically change various areas of computing, such as data-intensive processing and neuromorphic computing. New hardware architectures will need rethinking today's software stack and our widely used programming models. Finally, even though some post-CMOS technologies will not replace high-end CMOS transistors, there is great potential in new, yet unknown, applications. Applications, backed by a strong commercial demand, will give some technologies the push to become viable. Examples are radio-frequency for carbon nanotubes, graphene based sensors, organic low-cost transistors for wearables, and memristors for neuromorphic computing.\n</p> \n <h4>Post-CMOS logic for compute-intensive applications</h4> \n <p>Currently, there is no alternative to CMOS on the horizon to realize logic for large von Neumann computing, due to lower projected performance and/or yield challenges. Candidates discussed on the seminar have been: tunnel FETs, III-V, 2D materials such as graphene, CNTs, or spintronics. This means that general purpose and high-performance computing will most probably be based on CMOS in the medium term. To workaround the CMOS scaling problem, architectural specialization will gain more and more importance leading to general purpose computing systems with (various) specialized accelerators. We already find them today in, e.,g., mobile devices or GPU high-performance computing accelerators. Additionally, reconfigurable logic, such as FPGAs, and application-specific circuits have a high potential for performance gains. However, it is a big challenge to program such heterogeneous systems. Work towards solutions based on dataflow programming, memory access patterns, skeletons, and domain-specific languages have been discussed at the seminar. Additionally, operating system might need to adapt to allow, for example, accelerators to perform system calls.\n</p> \n <h4>Emerging memory technologies</h4> \n <p>In near future, new non-volatile memories will be available that could unify RAM and permanent storage, including MRAM and RRAM. While these could provide huge benefits for memory-intensive applications, the implications on architecture and software stack are not yet clear. For example, what will be the role of the file system in such an architecture? And how to deal with security aspects when every bit in RAM is permanent? Looking further into the future, the spin-based, non-volatile racetrack memory has the potential to compete with SRAM in terms of performance, while consuming considerably less energy. High-performance and energy-efficient non-volatile memories will also be important for neuromorphic devices.\n</p> \n <h4>Going 3D</h4> \n <p>3D integration enables the integration of heterogeneous technologies for logic, memory, communication, and sensing on a single chip. At the transistor level, 3D corrugated transistors were discussed as a promising direction to keep reducing the footprint while avoiding short-channel effects. Advancing today's die stacking technology through fine-grained vias linking the layers, will provide a substantial improvement for latencies and bandwidths in the systems. Bringing memory closer to logic will lower the memory wall (or even lead to a breakdown?). This means that many existing applications could be compute bound (again) and the processor architecture could be potentially simplified by removing the overhead that was added to workaround the memory wall, such as big caches and prefetchers, making place for additional compute units. In this optimistic scenario, general-purpose computing would receive a great (one-time) performance boost. For compilers and applications, we would have to rethink our way of optimizing code. \n</p> \n <h4>Computing beyond von Neumann</h4> \n <p>Architectural approaches beyond von Neumann were also discussed to speedup specific applications. Examples were neuromorphic computers, analog circuits, and dataflow machines. Of course these approaches cannot replace general purpose processors completely. A possible future architecture would combine classical von Neumann processors with non-von Neumann accelerators (on the same chip) to enable mixed programming. The recent industry adoption of machine learning drives the need for neuromorphic computers. While these systems already outperform general purpose processors today, new technologies such as non-volatile memories and analog spintronics promise even greater gains. Promising analog circuits were shown to perform well for concrete NP-complete problems such as SAT and graph coloring. Along these lines, a theoretical framework was introduced that may serve to abstractly compare the asymptotic energy efficiency between the analog and the digital realizations of a system. Finally, dataflow machines where discussed that stream data directly between computational units without the overhead of registers and caches, thereby removing the \"Turing tax\".\n</p> \n <h4>Special applications</h4> \n <p>Some of the materials considered in the seminar are very likely not able to compete with CMOS for logic, but have strengths in other electronic application areas such as sensors, radio frequency, and displays. Carbon nanotubes and graphene are promising materials for high-frequency antennas required for upcoming wireless communication systems. In the particular case of Graphene, it seems that the initial technological hype has passed, and engineering has taken over to produce new clever devices (e.g., nano-membranes for sensing). Organic electronics are already commercially available in displays and OLEDs. Their distinct features of flexibility, low production cost (printed electronics), and biodegradability could potentially open completely new application areas for logic, but not at comparable speed and efficiency to CMOS. These devices have also been deemed important for bio-compatibility. However, there is a long road ahead for testing and certifying actual devices in living tissue, which is not a trivial task, considering the wealth of molecules being investigated in this domain. \n</p> \n <h4>Co-design and design space exploration</h4> \n <p>Proper hardware/software co-design will be very important to achieve performance gains given the limits of CMOS and the prospective wildly heterogeneous and/or application-specific computing systems. Given a specific application problem, numerous implementation alternatives, from the algorithm down to the hardware architecture and technologies, might be feasible. Tools that help developers navigating the huge design space (e.g., using modeling and benchmarking techniques) and automate an efficient implementation as much as possible are needed. It appears to be that the large part of the software is less flexible than the hardware and much work has to be done to make software future-proof.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jer\u00f3nimo Castrill\u00f3n-Mazo, Tei-Wei Kuo, Heike E.

            "title": "Algorithms for Optimization Problems in Planar Graphs",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThere is a long tradition of research in algorithms for optimization problems in graphs, including work on many classical problems, both polynomial-time solvable problems and NP-hard problems, e.g. shortest paths, maximum flow and minimum cut, matching, T-joins, disjoint paths, traveling salesman, Steiner tree, graph bisection, vehicle routing, facility location, k-center, and maximum cut. One theme of such research addresses the complexity of these problems when the input graph is required to be a planar graph or a graph embedded on a low-genus surface.\n</p> \n <p>There are three reasons for this theme. First, optimization problems in planar graphs arise in diverse application areas. Second, researchers have discovered that, by exploiting the planarity of the input, much more effective algorithms can be developed -- algorithms that are faster or more accurate than those that do not exploit graph structure. Third, the study of algorithms for surface-embedded graphs drives the development of interesting algorithmic techniques.\nOne source of applications for planar-graph algorithms is geographic problems. Road maps are nearly planar, for example, so distances in planar graphs can model, e.g., travel times in road maps. Network design in planar graphs can be used to model scenarios in which cables must be run under roads. Planar graphs can also be used to model metrics on the earth's surface that reflect physical features such as terrain; this aspect of planar graphs has been used in studying wildlife corridors. Another source of applications is image processing. Some algorithms for problems such as image segmentation and stereo involve finding minimum cuts in a grid in which each vertex represents a pixel. Sometimes an aggregation technique (superpixels) coalesces regions into vertices, turning the grid into an arbitrary planar graph. A third example application is VLSI.\nAlgorithmic exploitation of a planar embedding goes back at least to the introduction of maximum flow by Ford and Fulkerson in 1956. Current research can be divided in three parts. For polynomial-time-solvable problems, such as maximum flow, shortest paths, matching, and min-cost circulation, researchers seek planarity-exploiting algorithms whose running times beat those of general-graph algorithms, ideally algorithms whose running times are linear or nearly linear. For NP-hard problems, there are two strategies: fixed-parameter algorithms and approximation algorithms.\nIn all three research subareas, there has recently been significant progress. However, many researchers are expert in only one or two subareas. This Dagstuhl Seminar brought together researchers from the different subareas, to introduce them to techniques from subareas that might be unfamiliar, and to foster collaboration across the subareas. The seminar will thus help to spur further advances in this active and growing area.\nThe scientific program of the seminar consisted of twenty-two talks. Four of these talks were longer (60--90 minute) tutorials overviewing the three main areas of the seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><em>Polynomial-time algorithms:</em>\"Tutorial on embedded graph algorithms\" (Jeff Erickson) and \"Monge property, dense distance graphs and speeding-up max-flow computations in planar graphs\" (Piotr Sankowski)\n</li><li> <em>Approximation schemes:</em>\"Some techniques for approximation schemes on planar graphs\" (Philip Klein)\n</li><li> <em>Fixed-parameter tractability:</em>\"The square-root phenomenon in planar graphs\" (D\u00e1niel Marx )\n</li></ul> \n <p>One of the main goals of the seminar was to encourage collaboration between the three communities, and these well-received tutorials helped by introducing the basics of each of these topics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe rest of the talks were 25-minute presentations on recent research of the participants. The time between lunch and the afternoon coffee break was left open for individual discussions and collaborations in small groups. An open-problem session was organized on Monday morning. Notes on the presented problems can be found in this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jeff Erickson, Philip N.

To do so, we gathered\npeople from various horizons: hardware vendors, theoreticians, verification\npractitioners and hackers. We asked them what issues they are facing, and what\ntools they would need to help them tackle said issues.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe first day was dedicated to theory. We had overviews of classic semanticists\ntools such as event structures, message sequence charts, and pomsets. The\nremaining days were mostly dedicated to models and verification practices,\nwhether from a user point of view, or a designer point of view. We chose to\nclose the days early, so that our guests would have ample time to come back to\nan interesting point they had heard during one of the talks, or engage in deep\ndiscussions. The feedback we got was quite positive, in that the seminar help\nspark discussions with, for example, a PhD student in concurrency theory, and a\nverification practitioner from ARM.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jade Alglave and Patrick Cousot\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h3>Topics and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nDirectional preferences or anisotropies are encountered across many different disciplines and spatial scales. For example, local anisotropies are imprinted in the cosmic microwave background radiation, the human brain contains elongated nerve fibers, etc. Such anisotropies lead to (physical) orientation-dependent quantities, i.e., quantities that take on different values when considered along different directions. Compared to scalar or vector-valued data, it is much more challenging to model, process, and visualize anisotropic\nquantities. Suitable mathematical models often involve tensors and\nother higher-order descriptors, and pose specific research challenges\nin several areas of computer science, such as visualization, image\nanalysis, and geometry processing.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to explore synergies between different fields, to inform computer scientists about open application challenges, and domain experts about existing solutions, this seminar brought together researchers from three different disciplines:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Medical <b>imaging,</b> where several modalities are now available to probe anisotropic behavior. In particular, Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) is based on measuring anisotropic diffusion. It makes it possible to visualize and quantify microstructural information in fibrous tissues such as  white-matter and muscles, and to infer larger-scale structures, such as fiber tracts in the human brain.\n</li><li> Computer graphics and <b>geometry processing,</b> where tensor   fields have a wide range of applications, such as quadrangular and hexahedral geometry remeshing, street network modeling, geometry synthesis, computational architecture, and path planning for environment scans.\n</li><li> Cosmology and <b>astronomy,</b> where anisotropy plays a crucial role. For example, anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) consist of small temperature fluctuations in the blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang. Anisotropies are also found in the CMB in the form of a polarization tensor field, and they arise in the field of \"cosmography, where efforts are united to map (parts of) the cosmos, e.g. the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe or cosmic web.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Organization of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nThis seminar was the seventh in a series of Dagstuhl seminars that was started in 2004, and has been devoted to the visualization and processing of tensor fields and higher-order descriptors. This particular instance of the seminar series focused on anisotropy in the fields of imaging, geometry, and astronomy.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo ensure a steady inflow of new ideas and challenges, we put an emphasis on inviting researchers who previously did not have the opportunity to attend one of the meetings in this series. This was true for almost half the attendees in the final list of participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar itself started with a round of introductions, in which all participants presented their area of work within 100 seconds with help of a single slide. This helped to create a basis for discussion early on during the week, and was particularly useful since participants came from different scientific communities, backgrounds, and countries.\n\nA substantial part of the week was devoted to presentations by 29 participants, who spent 20 minutes each on presenting recent advances, ongoing work, or open challenges, followed by ten minutes of discussion in the plenary, as well as in-depth discussions in the breaks and over lunch. Abstracts of the presentations are collected in this report. On Wednesday we held the traditional social event which was joined by almost all participants, and offered additional welcome opportunities for interaction.\n</p> \n <p>\nA total of six breakout sessions were organized in the afternoons of Monday and Tuesday. Moderators summarized the respective discussion in the plenary on Thursday afternoon. \nThe organizers came up with initial suggestions for session topics, which were refined further after discussion with the seminar participants. The session topics were as follows:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Astronomy\n</li><li> Time-varying anisotropy \n</li><li> Theoretical tools \n</li><li> Visualization \n</li><li> Diffusion MRI \n</li><li> Geometry \n</li></ul> \n <p>\nNotes were taken during all sessions, and the main points are summarized later in this report.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nThe participants all agreed that the meeting was inspiring and successful. It also stimulated new scientific collaborations and joint grant proposals. In addition we plan to publish another Springer book documenting the results of the meeting. Participants have pre-registered seventeen chapters already during the seminar, and we are in the process of collecting additional contributions both from participants and from researchers working on closely related topics who could not attend the meeting. We expect that the book will be ready for publication in 2020. \n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgment</h3> \n <p>\nThe organizers thank all the attendees for their contributions and extend special thanks to the moderators of the breakout sessions and the team of Schloss Dagstuhl for helping to make this seminar a success. As always, we enjoyed the warm atmosphere, which supports both formal presentations as well as informal exchanges of ideas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andrea Fuster, Evren \u00d6zarslan, Thomas Schultz, and Eugene Zhang\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <h3>Seminar Goals</h3> \n <p>\nThe application of computer-based methods by scholars of the Humanities has a tradition that goes back to the mid 20th century. Labelled \u201cDigital Humanities\u201d some 15 years ago, it has seen a significant growth since then [1]. An important part of Digital Humanities methodology is to establish data sets [2] based on cultural artefacts such as fiction texts, paintings, musical scores and recordings, and historical sources in all media. This is done in a number of different ways and includes some sort of extraction of data from sources computer assisted analysis and visualization. When this process works well, it supports scholars\u2019 endeavours to answer existing research questions and to generate new insights and novel research questions. A significant part of the data collected can be modeled as networks.\n</p> \n <p>\nExisting network analysis and visualization techniques have already proven themselves immensely useful in analyzing Digital Humanities data and providing new discoveries [3]. The central goal of research on network visualization for digital humanities scholars is to develop visualization techniques and algorithms that empower scholars to use those effectively as part of their research process and for communicating study results to readers. While network\nscience approaches are widely used in other research areas, the power of a network mindset and approach has not yet been fully exploited within the Humanities. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar aimed to enhance the development of network visualization algorithms and tools centered around humanities research. In particular, its goals were as follows:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Interdisciplinary Exchange: to discuss existing network visualization methods and algorithms in perspective of their potential application within the Humanities;\n</li><li>Terminology Gap: Bridging the gap in terminology between Digital Humanities on one side and computer scientists in Network Visualization and Graph Drawing on the other side;\n</li><li>Data: to discuss Humanities\u2019 data sources and their nature, research questions, use cases, and specific application profiles in perspective of their potential support by network visualisation.\n</li><li> Reserch Agenda: Formulation of research agenda on \u201cNetwork Visualization in the Digital Humanities\u201d. Creation of interdisciplinary teams of researchers that address specific scientific challenges of the agenda;\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Seminar Program</h3> \n <p>The seminar brought together 27 researchers from Network Visualization and Digital Humanities communities. The initial two days of the weeklong event were devoted to bring together the different communities and to develop a mutual understanding. Researchers informed each other about their scholarly background through short, five-minute talks. In addition, there were eight long, 45 minutes, presentations in which digital humanities scholars discussed\nnetwork and network visualization challenges and opportunities in their field of expertise. This was complemented by surveys on network visualization and successful examples of cooperation between visualization and digital humanities researchers.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring both days the participants were asked to post questions and issues they would like to discuss in the remaining three days of the seminar. After a voting, four research areas most interesting the participant were identified. All four met the guiding principles in that they describe both: highly relevant applications within the Humanities as well as innovative research challenges for Network Visualisation. They are as follows:\n</p> <ul>\n<li>Complex networks, in particular multivariate, multilayered, and multilevel networks;\n</li><li>Linked networks;\n</li><li>Temporal networks;\n</li><li>Uncertainty, incompleteness, and ambiguity of data.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Four groups were formed to work on those four topics over the remaining three days. There were several opportunities for joint discussions and progress reports across the groups. Summaries of the group discussions can be found in Section 4.\n</p> \n <h3>Future Plans</h3> \n <p>During the seminar the participants decided to proceed with a publication of a manifesto,\noutlining a research agenda for \u201cnetwork visualisation in the Humanities\u201d. It was also planned\nto publish an edited volume on specific aspects of the overarching topic, possibly along the\nfour major research areas identified by the seminar. The volume will be submitted as a\nspecial issue to \u201cHistorical Network Research\u201d, an Open Access Journal.\n</p> \n <h3>Evaluation</h3> \n <p>\nThe feedback provided by the participants in form of a survey collected by Schloss Dagstuhl\nwas highly positive and in most aspects above the average collected over the last 60 seminars.\nThe participants agreed that the seminar inspired new ideas, collaborations, joint publications\nand brought insight from neighboring fields. There was a number of positive comments by\nthe participants on the structure and organization of the seminar as well as several useful\nsuggestions for the future seminars.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgement</h3> \n <p>As an organizing committee of the seminar we would like to thank the scientific and\nadministration staff of Schloss Dagstuhl for the excellent support they provided, both in\nthe preparation phase and during the seminar. On behalf of all participants, we would also\nlike to thank Dagstuhl for the high quality facilities provided, for excellent rooms for work\nand socializing, for the tasty meals, and of course also for the excellent wine cellar. The\norganizers of the seminar would also like to thank Ray Siemens and Dan Edelstein for their\ncontributions to the initial Dagstuhl proposal. Finally, we thank Christina Gillmann for\ntaking the responsibility for this report.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>\nKohle und Malte Rehbein (Hg.): Digital Humanities.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis workshop aimed to address this mismatch between natural optimization models for important scientific problems and practical optimization solvers for their solution. By bringing together experts in both theory and implementation, this workshop energized efforts making MINLP as ubiquitous a paradigm for both modeling and solving important decision problems as mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) have become in recent years. In particular, we highlighted:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>MINLP Solver Software</b> Early in the workshop, the main developers of MINLP software packages outlined the current state of their software. This served as a needs analysis for the community to identify crucial areas for future development. We also dedicated a break-out session discussing best practices for conducting scientifically-meaningful computational experiments in MINLP.\n\n</li><li><b>Intersecting Mixed-Integer &amp; Nonlinear Programming</b> MINLP is a superset of both mixed integer linear optimization and nonlinear optimization, so we leveraged the best methods from both by incorporating both sets of experts. \n\n</li><li><b>Driving Applications</b> Applications experts, e.g. in petrochemicals, manufacturing, and gas networks, offered their perspectives on what practitioners need from MINLP solvers. We dedicated an entire break-out session to energy applications and explored what are the needs for MINLP within the energy domain. During the open problem session, several other applications experts outlined other open problems in engineering.\n\n</li><li><b>Connections between MINLP and machine learning</b> Many machine learning challenges can be formulated as MINLP. Also, machine learning can significantly improve MINLP solver software. We explored these connections at length in a break-out session.\n</li></ul> \n <p>This seminar brought together an assortment of computer scientists with expertise in mathematical optimization. Many of the presentations were more theoretical and suggested new technologies that the solver software could incorporate. Other presentations were more practical and discussed building solver software or applying that software to specific domain applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs a result of this seminar, we are planning a special issue in the journal \"Optimization &amp; Engineering\". We are also working to turn the notes from our open problem session into a larger document that will start a conversation with the entire mathematical optimisation community. Participants broadly expressed that this week at Dagstuhl helped them workshop their papers, so several academic papers will explicitly mention the Dagstuhl seminar. Finally, a new set of metrics for comparing MINLP solvers were developed at this meeting and will greatly aid future solver testing.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Pierre Bonami, Ambros M.

            "data": "\n <p>\nData centres are at the heart of the modern Internet. They host web services, social networking, cloud computing and are increasingly used by operators to host virtual network functions. All these services have one thing in common: they require extremely low latency communication in the data centre. Consequently we have seen the birth of a new field in networking research - data centre latency control.\n</p> \n <p>\nUnlike the earlier generation of high-performance computing clusters, data centres have tended to use commodity off-the-shelf servers and switches, and run standard operating systems. However, traditional networking equipment and TCP-IP stacks were designed for wide-area networks, where the goal is to maximize throughput, and the control loop between end systems is measured in 10s of milliseconds. By contrast, data centres operate on timescales that are several orders of magnitude lower. And while throughput is important, the plentiful bandwidth of data centre networks makes throughput a secondary concern to latency.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar explored existing and future techniques for controlling data centre latency across the entire software and hardware stack, including in-network solutions, end-host solutions, and others. The aims of the seminar are to foster closer collaboration between academic researchers, industry, and operators.\n38 researchers attended the multidisciplinary seminar. Over the course of the 3-day seminar, seven presentations were given on various aspects of data center networking. Taking the presentations as input, the workshop then broke into six working groups to discuss research aspects of latency control. The seminar was concluded by voting and discussing on possible conclusions from our discussions. Each conclusion was discussed briefly, then voted on. The outcome of the breakout session as well as the concluding statements are summarized in this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Oliver Hohlfeld and Mohammad Alizadeh Attar and Jon Crowcroft and Lars Eggert and Klaus Wehrle\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>Computability theory grew from work to understand effectiveness in\nmathematics. Sophisticated tools have been developed towards this task. For a\nwhile, the area tended to be concerned with internal considerations such as\nthe structure of the various hierarchies developed for the tasks of\ncalibrations. More recently, this machinery has seen modern applications into\nareas such as model theory, algorithmic randomness, analysis, ergodic theory,\nnumber theory and the like; and the tools have been used to answer several\nclassical questions. Seminar 17081 was an opportunity for researchers in\nseveral areas of modern computability theory to get together and interact.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe format was for 2-3 lectures in the morning with at least one being an\noverview, and a similar number of 3-4 in the afternoon, with Wednesday\nafternoon and Friday afternoon free. The weather being miserable,\nparticipants opted to stay at the Schloss Wednesday afternoon, and quite a\nbit of work was done in pairs in the time left free, on the Wednesday\nafternoon in particular. At least one problem seen as significant in the area\nwas solved (one concerning the strength of Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs in\nreverse mathematics), and the organizers know of several other papers in\npreparation resulting from the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe lectures were from various areas, but the greatest concentration was\naround\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> classification tools in computable analysis (the Weihrauch Lattice) and\nReverse Mathematics (on what proof-theoretic strength is needed to\nestablish results in mathematics), and these areas' relationship with\ngenerating algorithms, such as in proof mining;\n</li><li> computable model theory (looking at structures such as groups, rings, or\nabstract algebraic structures, endowing them with effectivity and seeing\nwhat else is algorithmic).

            "title": "Algorithmic Problems in Group Theory",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe field of combinatorial group theory, a part of abstract algebra, is tightly linked to computational problems from its early days. Already in 1911, i.e., 25 years before Turing's work on the halting problem appeared, Max Dehn introduced and investigated three fundamental group theoretical decision problems: the <em>word problem</em>, the <em>conjugacy problem</em>, and the <em>isomorphism problem</em>. Dehn's problems had a strong influence on the development of modern theoretical computer science. It took more that 40 years before the work of Novikov, Boone, Adjan, and Rabin showed the undecidability of Dehn's decision problems in the class of finitely presented groups. Despite these negative results, for many groups the word problem turned out to be decidable in many important classes of groups. With the rise of complexity theory in the 1960's, also the computational complexity of group theoretic problems moved into the focus of research. From the very beginning, this field attracted researchers from mathematics as well as computer science. Using algorithmic techniques from complexity theory, researchers were able to exhibit highly efficient algorithms for groups, where initially only pure decidability results have been known. A milestone in this context is Lipton and Zalcstein's logspace algorithm for the word problem of finitely generated linear groups. This was the first result putting the word problem for an important class of groups \ninto a complexity class below polynomial time.  In the last 10 years, researchers pushed  the limits further towards small circuit complexity classes. In particular  the class TC^0 turned out be very important in this context. Despite its limited computational \npower many important group theoretical problems problems were shown to be in TC^0.\n</p> \n <p>\nComplexity theoretical questions are not the only area where we have seen fruitful interactions between group theory\nand theoretical computer science in recent years. Other examples can be found in automata theory, \ndata compression, model theory, and reachability problems for infinite state systems. \nThe following paragraphs put some of the seminar talks\ninto the context of these topics and mentions some of the open problems that were discussed during the seminar.\n</p> \n <h4>Groups and circuit complexity</h4> \n <p>\nHoward Straubing gave an excellent survey on circuit complexity that was particularly addressed to non-experts in complexity theory.  Barrington's famous result according to which the word problem for every finite non-solvable groups is hard for NC^1 was explained and several important results centered around the circuit complexity class TC^0 were surveyed. In recent years, TC^0 turned out to be the right class for characterizing the complexity of several group theoretical problems.  Two seminar talks presented further examples of group theory problems in TC^0: Armin Wei\u00df gave a talk about the power word problem which is a succinct version of the classical word problem, where\npowers g^n of group elements with binary encoded integer exponents n are allowed in the input. Despite this succinctness, several power word problems (e.g. for nilpotent groups and certain wreath products of finitely generated abelian groups) can be still solved in TC^0. Moses Ganardi talked on the knapsack problem for finitely generated groups which asks for the solvability\nof certain exponent equations over a group. Among other results he gave a simple proof showing that the knapsack problem for unary encoded integers is in TC^0. This result generalizes to all finitely generated abelian groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral promising open problems related to the circuit complexity of group theoretical problems were discussed in the open problem sessions: The above mentioned result of Barrington on finite non-solvable groups motivates\nthe question whether the word problem for every finitely generated solvable group is NC^1-hard.Also finding new classes of infinite groups with a word problem in TC^0 is an open research problem that was intensively discussed during the seminar. So far, it is known that solvable linear groups have a word problem in TC^0 and that the class of groups with a word problem in TC^0 is closed under wreath products.\n</p> \n <h4> Compression techniques in group theory</h4> \n <p>\nCompression techniques turned out to be an important tool for obtaining efficient algorithms in group theory. The general philosophy is trying to avoid storing extremely long words by computing on a compressed representation of these words. This led to the formulation of several succinct versions of classical group theoretical problems, where the group elements in the input\nare given a succinct version. The power word problem that was introduced by Armin Wei\u00df (see the previous paragraph) is such a succinct problem. The main result of Armin Wei\u00df' talk was an efficient reduction of the power word problem\nfor a free group to the (ordinary) word problem of a free group. It is open whether similar reductions also exist for right-angeled Artin groups and hyperbolic groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the context of solving equations over groups and monoids, the so-called recompression technique led to several important results in recent years. Arthur Jez (the inventor of this technique) gave a talk on recompression\nand outlined his non-deterministic linear time algorithm for solvability of word equations.  Ciobanu and Elder presented their recent work on equations in hyperbolic groups where they use recompression in order to show that the set of all solutions for a system of equations over a hyperbolic group is an EDT0L language.\n</p> \n <h4>Groups and model theory</h4> \n <p>This research area directly relates to the previous paragraph. The goal is to understand the first-order theory of  groups. Of particular interest is the Diophantine theory. Decidability of the Diophantine theory means that one\ncan decide whether a boolean combination of word equations has a solution. Olga Kharlampovich gave a talk about Diophantine theories of metabelian groups. She proved decidability for several important metabelian groups: Baumslag-Solitar \ngroups BS(1,n) and wreath products mathbb{Z} wr mathbb{Z} and mathbb{Z}_n wr mathbb{Z}. Albert Garreta continued this topic and talked about Diophantine theories of solvable groups. He presented a large class of solvable groups (containing for instance all finitely generated non-virtually\nabelian nilpotent groups and all polycyclic groups that are not virtually metabelian) for which the Diophantine theory is at least as  hard as the Diophantine theory of a suitable ring of algebraic integers. This leads to the conjecture that for each member of his family the Diophantine theory is undecidable.\n</p> \n <p>\nMontserrat Casals-Ruiz talked on the positive theory of groups acting on trees. The positive theory of a group contains all negation-free statements from the full first-order theory. Montserrat Casals-Ruiz proved that many natural examples of groups acting on trees have the same positive theory as a free group of rank two. Ilya Kazachkov presented new results on the full first-order theory of free products and, more generally, graph products of groups. He showed that under certain conditions, elementary equivalent free products (meaning that their first-order theories coincide) must have elementary\nequivalent factors. \n</p> \n <h4>Groups and automata</h4> \n <p>Besides complexity of algorithmic problems,  a very interesting connection between group theory and theoretical computer science is provided by automata\ntheory, using the very flexible and algorithmically efficient finite\nstate automata to somehow describe an infinite group. This led to the development of automatic groups and automaton groups.  Automaton groups are a subclass of so-called self-similar groups. Laurent Bartholdi gave a talk on algorithmic results on self-similar groups and outlined the proof of a recent breakthrough result of Bartholdi and Mitrofanov stating that there exist self-similar groups with an undecidable word problem. For the particular case of automaton groups the word problem belongs to <b>PSPACE</b>. The question whether there exist automaton groups with a <b>PSPACE</b>-complete word problem was intensively discussed during the seminar. Recently, as a direct outcome of the seminar, an automaton group with this property was constructed\nby Jan Philipp W\u00e4chter and Armin Wei\u00df [An automaton group with PSPACE-complete word problem, arXiv, 2019. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03424\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03424</a>]. Volodia Nekrashevych presented in his talk a generalization of automaton\ngroups based on non-deterministic synchronous automata-transducers and discussed their algorithmic properties and relationship to dynamical systems.\n</p> \n <h4>Reachability problems</h4> \n <p>The study of reachability problems for matrix semigroups has a long tradition in theoretical computer science. Formulated in terms of algebra, the reachability problem is equivalent to the subsemigroup membership problem. Several variants and generalization (rational subset membership problem, knapsack problem) have been recently investigated as well. Igor Potapov gave a survey talk on recent progress on the matrix reachability problem from a computer science perspective. Georg Zetzsche presented several new decidability results for the rational subset membership problem in wreath products.  Moses Ganardi talked on wreath products as well, but put the focus on the knapsack problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe above talks and the open problem session identified several interersting open problems related to reachability problems. An outstanding open problem in this context asks whether the submonoid membership problem for the group GL_3(mathbb{Z}) is decidable. Recently it was shown that the submonoid membership problem for the Heisenberg group (a subgroup of GL_3(mathbb{Z})) is decidable, This result suggests two generalizations: (i) the rational subset membership problem for Heisenberg groups and (ii) the submonoid membership problem for groups of unitriangular integer matrices. In both case it is open whether the problem is decidable.  Georg Zetzsche mentioned in his talk the submonoid membership problem and the rational subset membership problem in the Baumslag-Solitar group BS(1,2) as open research problems.\n</p> \n <h4>Concluding remarks and future plans</h4> \n <p>The seminar was well received as witnessed by the high rate of accepted invitations. There was a good balance between participants from computer science and pure mathematics, and this mixture led to many active discussions and the discovery of new connections and promising open problems.\nThe organizers regard this seminar as a great success. With steadily increasing interactions between such researchers, we foresee another seminar focusing on the interplay between computer science and group theory.  Finally, the organizers wish to express their gratitude to the Scientific Directors of the Dagstuhl Centre for their support of the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Volker Diekert, Olga Kharlampovic, Markus Lohrey, and Alexei Myasnikov\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nTropical mathematics is a uniting name for different research directions which \ninvolve the semi-ring of real numbers endowed with the operations min, + \n(called the tropical semi-ring). It has emerged in several areas of computer \nscience and of pure and applied mathematics. For the first time, this seminar brought together the computer science and the mathematics viewpoints.

            "title": "Theory and Applications of Hashing",
            "data": "\n <h3>Background</h3> \n <p>\nThe idea of hashing was proposed in the 1950s as an efficient method for implementing symbol tables in compilers. In succeeding decades it has emerged as an algorithmic tool that goes well beyond its original purpose, providing solutions for a wide range of algorithmic problems. While the theory of hashing may appear mature, in fact, many new advances have been made in recent years. Also, the number of applications has grown to an extent that few people realize how broad the reach of hashing is, or have a comprehensive overview. The aim of this seminar was to bring together researchers with an interest in hashing methods (and more generally random mappings) from various perspectives, spanning theory and a diverse set of application areas. In this way we wanted to identify opportunities for further advancing the field.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <h4>Theory</h4> \n <p>\nThe theoretical side includes aspects such as the design of hash functions, the design of algorithm and data structure primitives, and the mathematical analysis of hashing schemes. For hash function design, since Carter and Wegman proposed universal hashing there has been a fertile research agenda identifying sufficient randomness properties of hash functions for various applications, and on the other hand devising resource-efficient hash functions having these properties. While new simple and efficient hash function constructions with strong theoretical properties keep appearing (seminar participants have contributed to this), there are still many applications of hashing for which no efficient hash function construction is known. At the same time it is increasingly clear that traditional measures of hash function performance like collision probability and independence are inadequate to describe the randomness properties needed in many applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile hashing is interesting in its own right, it has also become a foundational building block for higher level algorithms and data structures, each of which can in turn often find uses in a variety of application spaces. Various hash-based sketches laid the groundwork for the field of streaming algorithms, by showing how approximate counting could be done effectively. More recently, hashing algorithms have provided frameworks for similarity measures for text and images, data reconciliation, and even fast sparse Fast Fourier transform algorithms. As we construct richer, more elaborate structures on top of the hashing building blocks, we stretch what we require from hashing further. \n</p> \n <p>\nMathematical analysis of hashing schemes, an area enriched by early work of Knuth but grown well beyond, has inspired the development of a number of combinatorial methods and results. In the 1990s it was realized that load balancing using the best of two (or more) random choices leads to a much more even distribution, often referred to as the ``power of two choices''. Another great success in this area, obtained during the last decade, has been the analysis of cuckoo hashing; several seminar participants were involved in this. On the other hand, as questions become answered, new questions arise; in the case of cuckoo hashing, the effectiveness of variants including double hashing and partial-key cuckoo hashing are not understood. Beyond the hashing schemes themselves, data structures and algorithms that make use of lower-level hashing primitives further require and benefit from mathematical analysis. The fundamental connections between hashing, sparse reconstruction algorithms, and various sketching approaches are only now starting to be realized.\n</p> \n <h4>Applications</h4> \n <p>\nHashing is of course heavily used in information storage and retrieval contexts. For example, the \"power of two choices\" paradigm(where several seminar participants were among the pioneers) has resulted in extremely scalable and robust architectures for distributed hash tables (also known as key-value stores).\n</p> \n <p>\nOther applications of hashing are appearing at a tremendous rate, as systems-designers and builders become accustomed to a world where approximate answers (as opposed to exact answers) are not only sufficient, they are necessary for efficiency. Indeed, hashing was one of the key methodologies for handling big data well before \"big data\" was even a widely used term. Since the seminal paper of Flajolet and Martin that showed how to efficiently compute an approximate count of the number of elements in a data stream, hashing has been a central tool in the design of algorithms for data streams, where the inability to store all the information that passes requires approximations. But in recent years the use of hashing has spread to many other settings where data is stored and accessible, but scalability can be achieved only by resorting to approximation algorithms similar to those developed in the setting of data streams. One early success story in this direction is the method for identifying near-duplicate web pages in Altavista using min-wise hashing. Another is HyperANF, a refined version of the Flajolet-Martin method that was used in 2012 to compute the distance distribution of the Facebook social network, making it by far the largest scale Milgram-like experiment ever performed. Finally, Bloom filters, invented around 1970 to provide a small-memory approximate representation of a set, have become a staple in systems, with countless variations expanding on its initial functionality, such as counts associated with set elements or aging out of set items as new elements are dynamically added. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the field of machine learning, random mappings of data to lower-dimensional vectors that are easier to handle is of increasing importance for big data applications. This is true in particular since machine learning algorithms often work with kernelized feature vectors whose dimension far exceeds the size of data vectors. Designing randomized mappings that meet the criteria of machine learning applications has been an active research area in recent years. NIPS 2014 awarded one of two best paper awards a paper co-authored by seminar participant Shrivastava that presents a new asymmetric locality-sensitive hash function design for machine learning applications and shows how it leads to significant speedups.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe rich interplay between theory and practice in the field of hashing cannot be overstated. Applications drive the need for new algorithms and data structures based on hashing, as well as the need for more efficient classes of hash function families with provable theoretical guarantees. Specific implementations developed in the field often do not have theoretical guarantees on performance or accuracy, creating new theoretical problems and driving a need to make theory and practice meet. \n</p> \n <h4>Industrial relevance.</h4> \n <p>\nThe workshop topic was highly relevant for companies dealing with big data. Three seminar participants are affiliated with Google, one has worked on hashing algorithms at AT&amp;T for a decade, and one is affiliated with VMware. Also, one organizer was affiliated with IBM at the time of the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcome of the seminar</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together quite a few leading figures in the area of hashing, mixed with a good fraction of young researchers, some of which are behind many of the most exciting results in the area in recent years. Areas that were particularly well represented were: Analysis of multiple-choice hashing methods, hashing for high-dimensional search problems, applications of hashing in string algorithms, applications of hashing in machine learning, streaming (approximation) algorithms, high-performance hash function construction, and algorithm engineering. Many results in these areas were presented in 18 shorter talks. Four longer talks (by A. Andoni, A. McGregor, U. Wieder, and Q. Zhang) contributed background, overview over new results, and aspects of applications of hashing in industry. Open problems were discussed in an open problem session; four of them are included in this report. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe paper [1]  on fillable arrays co-authored by J. Nelson was motivated by a talk given by T.

            "data": "\n <h3>Introduction</h3> \n <h4>Motivation</h4> \n <p>\nSince its birth in 1990, the Web has evolved from a simple, stateless delivery mechanism for static hypertext documents to a fully-fledged run-time environment for distributed, multi-party applications. Even today, there is still a continuous demand for new features and capabilities which drives the Web's evolution onwards. This unplanned and often chaotic development has led to several deeply ingrained security and privacy problems that plague the platform:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The Web's original hypertext, multi-origin nature which is manifested in the design of HTML and HTTP is in fundamental conflict with JavaScript's Same-Origin Policy, the Web's most important security mechanism.\n</li><li> Important security properties, such as end-to-end communication security or endpoint identity are outside of the control of the actual applications. Instead, they depend on the security of external entities, such as domain name servers or certificate authorities.\n</li><li>Data/code separation in web applications is practically infeasible, as the HTTP link between server-side application logic and client-side application interface requires an intermixing of protocol, data and code fragments within a single continuous character stream.\n</li><li> HTTP is a stateless protocol without a native session or authentication tracking concept.\n</li><li> Users are not aware of general or application specific threats. Protecting against these threats (incl. to know which security indicators to trust) is nowadays difficult and time consuming.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nUsing this fragile basis, critical applications are created, that long have left the strict client-server paradigm, on which the Web was initially built. Instead, scenarios are realized that involve several mutually distrusting entities in a single security and application context. In many cases the browser is the link that connects the remote parties, either via direct JavaScript inclusion, web mashups, or through the usage of web protocols, such as OpenID and OAuth.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe accumulated ballast of the last two decades of web evolution, the ever growing functional demands of sophisticated web applications and the ambitious vision of the web platform's drivers creates an exciting tension field which is in constant conflict with the required security assurances of high value business applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nSince approximately ten years, academic security and privacy research has recognized the importance of the web platform and the unique characteristics and challenges of the web security and privacy topic. And while specific techniques, that originated from academic research, such as the Content Security Policy, have been adapted in practice, the fundamental security problems of the web remain and the overall vulnerability landscape is getting worse, as it can be seen in the constant flow of reported web security issues in bug trackers and vulnerability databases.\n</p> \n <p>\nAcademic web security research has started 2007 and usable security research started almost at the same time. In the context of this Dagstuhl Seminar, we will revisit the lessons learned from the last decade and revisit the success stories and mistakes that have been made. Questions, that have to be raised in include \"What has worked?\", \"What has been taken up by industry?\", \"What failed and why?\", and -- most importantly -- \"What did we learn?\"\n</p> \n <h4>Seminar Objectives</h4> \n <p>\nToday, several unconnected groups drive the topic, including Security, Privacy as well as Usable Security &amp; Privacy Academics, standardization, and browser vendors. The seminar will facilitate essential exchange between them. This will allow academia to directly influence browser vendors and standardization representatives, and allow industry representatives to influence the research community.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview</h3> \n <h4>Participants</h4> \n <p>The seminar was well attended with 39 participants. A good balance of European and American researchers was present. Furthermore, the group represented a nice mix of participants of academia and industry. Compared to the previous editions, not only researchers from the web security area participated but also from the field of human factors in security.\n</p> \n <h4>Structure</h4> \n <p>This was the third Dagstuhl seminar on Web application security. The seminar's organisation combined overview presentation of various subfields, highlight talks, and discussions in working groups. In particular the overview presentations were important to connect the two research fields web security from a more technical point of view and human factors in security. This way, also a good, comprehensive view on current activities and open problems in the realm of Web application security in particular from a user's point of view could be achieved and areas for potential future collaborations could be identified. \n</p> \n <h4>Talks</h4> \n <p>The following people presented either an overview of their research field, very recent research results or overarching observations on the field of web application security.

Thus, it was a great opportunity to reflect on a decade of web security research. In 2009 the field was largely undefined and that year's seminar offered a wild mix of various topics, some with lasting impact and many that went nowhere. Where the 2009 seminar was overly broad, the 2012 iteration had a comparatively narrow focus as the seminar was dominated by the notion that solving web security mainly revolves around solving the security properties of JavaScript. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis year's seminar reflected the ongoing maturing of the topic very well. Fundamental problems, such as Cross-site Scripting or the Web Browser security model, are well explored and their understanding served as a great foundation for the seminar's discussions. This allowed the extension of the topic toward important facets, such as privacy problems or human factors. While the addressed topics were too broad and the time for overarching discussions was limited due to the three-day format of the seminar, the sparked discussions were fruitful for several follow-up activities (see above). An underlying theme of the seminar can be summarized as \"the last decade of web security has broad good progress and development but the overall problem is still neither fully understood nor solved\". Especially, the newly introduced dimension of integrating human factors in security, which was reflected through including several high-profile members of this community in the seminar, is still immature. \n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the seminar's prime objectives has been reached very nicely: The fostering of collaboration between the different web security communities. For one, several compelling interactions between practitioners from industry (such as SAP, Commerzbank and Cure53) and researcher from academia took place. Furthermore, thanks to the fact that all major web browser vendors (plus the new privacy-centric browser Brave) were represented at the seminar, both cross-browser vendor interaction as well as browser/academia collaborations were initiated, with the browser-based sanitizer initiative (see breakout session 4.3) being a prominent example. \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Martin Johns, Nick Nikiforakis, Melanie Volkamer, and John Wilander\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>Dagstuhl Seminar 17282 took place at Schloss Dagstuhl from 9 to 14 July\n2017. We had 29 participants and nine invited talks. The main theme of this seminar was the analysis and prediction of movement trajectories. In particular, we focused on the study of movement patterns of individuals, and the interactions of moving agents with each other and with the~environment.\n</p> \n <h3>Themes</h3> \n <p>\nMovement analysis is key to understanding the underlying mechanisms of dynamic\nprocesses. Movement occurs in <em>space</em> and <em>time</em> across\n<em>multiple scales</em> and through an embedding <em>context</em> that influence how entities move. The importance of spatiotemporal aspect of movement has attracted a wide range of studies. Analysis of movement trajectories is a core element of Movement Ecology in Biology, as well as being important across disciplines as diverse as Geographic Information Sciences (GIS), Transportation, Criminology, Epidemiology, Computer Gaming, and Phylogenetics. Development of efficient algorithms for analyzing and predicting will be vital to realizing the hopes for new generation smart transport systems and smart cities. Furthermore, naturally generated trajectories provide a fascinating context for mathematical and computational study of Geometry and Stochastic Processes. \n</p> \n <p>\nA trajectory is a time-stamped sequence of locations, representing the movement of entities in space and time. Trajectories are often created by sampling GPS locations, but they can also originate from RFID tags,\nvideo, or radar analysis. Time-series of locations can also be associated with\nother {co-temporal data}, such as pressure recordings for avian or aquatic\nanimals, activity sensors and accelerometers to measure energy expenditure, or\nthe {myriad time-stamped data} recorded by modern smartphones alongside GPS locations.  \n</p> \n <p>\nThe study of movement involves development of concepts and methods to transform movement observations (trajectory data) to knowledge of the behavior of moving phenomena under known conditions. This knowledge is then used to calibrate simulation models to predict movement and behavioral responses in varying environmental conditions. Figure 1 illustrates a continuum encapsulating fundamental areas of movement research for (1) {understanding movement processes} through trajectory representation and computational movement analysis (the right side of Figure 1); and (2) {modeling} behavior of moving phenomena and {prediction} of their responses to environmental changes though modeling and simulation approaches (the left side of Figure 1). These two processes are tightly connected and feed into each other, often through a validation procedure on the basis of real trajectory observations.\n</p> \n <p>During recent years computational movement analysis tools for trajectory data have been developed within the areas of GIScience and algorithms. Analysis objectives include clustering, similarity analysis, trajectory segmentation into characteristic sub-trajectories, finding movement patterns like flocking, and relating patterns to context, and several others. Since these computations are mostly spatial, algorithmic solutions have been developed in the areas of computational geometry and GIScience. The basic analysis tasks for trajectory data are by now comparatively well understood and efficient algorithms have been developed to perform computational movement analysis. However, to be truly effective and to have real-world impact, trajectory analysis has to move beyond `understanding movement' and tackle substantially more involved questions in `modeling, simulation,  and prediction' of movement responses to a changing environment or as results of (social) interactions.\n</p> \n <p>\nSimultaneously, in the area of ecology the study of motion of animals has\nalso become a topic of increasing interest. Many animal species move\nin groups, with or without a specific leader. The motivation for motion\ncan be foraging, escape from predators, changing climate, or it can\nbe unknown. The mode of movement can be determined by social interactions,\nenergy efficiency, possibility of discovery of resources, and of course\nthe natural environment. The more fascinating aspects of ecology include\ninteraction between entities and collective motion. These are harder to\ngrasp in a formal manner, needed for modelling and automated analysis.\nThe basic analysis tasks for trajectory data are by now comparatively\nwell understood and efficient algorithms have been developed to perform them.\nHowever, to be truly effective and have real-world impact, trajectory analysis\nhas to move beyond these basic tasks and tackle substantially more involved\nquestions, prime examples being (social) interaction and collective motion.\n</p> \n <h3>Research Approach and Questions Addressed</h3> \n <p>\nTrajectories are mathematical objects with geostatistical properties.\nMovement is a {process} that occurs as a response to the {state} of a {moving\nentity} across multiple {spatial} and {temporal} scales. The {state} and\nresulting {behavior} of moving entities determine the {characteristics} and\n{capacities} of movement (e.g., speeds, directions, accelerations, path sinuosity), which are highly influenced by interaction with environment, geographic {context}, and other moving entities.\nInternal properties of the moving agent such as its propensity to explore, or\nits power and size, typically distinguish the trajectory from that of other\nagents. As such no element of a trajectory can truly be independent of its other\nparts. Therefore, we take a view of trajectory analysis that emphasizes the treatment of the whole trajectory as a unit, rather than a series of moment-by-moment steps.\n</p> \n <p>\nTrajectories are generated by some underlying process, which is typically assumed to integrate both stochastic elements (such as Brownian motion) and more deterministic interactions between the moving agent and the external world. Many research questions can be posed about such processes, but in this seminar we will focused primarily on identifying the forms of interaction, both with other moving agents and with environmental stimuli, and on predicting the characteristics of future trajectories. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn the seminar, we explored the following questions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>To what extent movement observations convey information on the underlying <em>behavior</em> of moving phenomena?\n</li><li>How susceptible are  behaviors of moving agents to environmental changes?\n</li><li>To what extent changes in the behavior of moving phenomena  indicate changes in the environment?\n</li><li>What does it mean to <em>predict</em> a trajectory? Should we focus on predicting the spatial locations or the geometric properties?\n</li><li>How can we assess a predictive model?\n</li><li>How can computational geometry help movement prediction?\n</li><li>What characteristics of motion are indicative of specific trajectory generating processes, and how can we compute these efficiently?\n</li><li>What is the role of time in trajectory analysis? Where can we analyze the shapes of paths independently of the time stamps and where are these vital to understanding the underlying mechanisms?\n</li><li>Can we build a classification of trajectory generating mechanisms and associated trajectory properties, such as navigation by waypoints, explorative foraging\n</li><li> What is the <em>home range</em>? Can we have a concrete definition for home range or activity space?\n</li><li> What is a <em>collective</em>?\n</li><li> Can we make algorithms that work across scales?\n</li><li> To what extent <em>goal oriented movement</em> can be inferred from <em>local movement patterns</em>?</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mark Birkin, Somayeh Dodge, Brittany Terese Fasy, and Richard Philip Mann\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nMature scientific disciplines are characterized by their theories, synthesizing what is known about phenomena into forms which generate falsifiable predictions about the world. In computer science, the role of synthesizing ideas has largely been through formalisms that describe how programs compute. However, just as important are scientific theories about how programmers write these programs. For example, software engineering research has increasingly begun gathering data, through observations, surveys, interviews, and analysis of artifacts, about the nature of programming work and the challenges developers face, and evaluating novel programming tools through controlled experiments with software developers. Computer science education and human-computer interaction research has done similar work, but for people with different levels of experience and ages learning to write programs. But data from such empirical studies is often left isolated, rather than combined into useful theories which explain all of the empirical results. This lack of theory makes it harder to predict in which contexts programming languages, tools, and pedagogy will actually help people successfully write and learn to create software. \n</p> \n <p>\nComputer science needs scientific theories that synthesize what we believe to be true about programming and offer falsifiable predictions. Whether or not a theory is ultimately found to be consistent with evidence or discarded, theories offer a clear statement about our current understanding, helping us in prioritizing studies, generalizing study results from individual empirical results to more general understanding of phenomena, and offering the ability to design tools in ways that are consistent with current knowledge. \n</p> \n <p>\nDagstuhl Seminar 22231 on <em>Theories of Programming</em> explored the creation and synthesis of scientific theories which describe the relationship between developers and code within programming and social activities. The seminar brought together researchers from software engineering, human-computer interaction, programming languages, and computer science education to exchange ideas about potential theories of programming. We identified and proposed theories that arose from many sources: untested but strongly-held beliefs, anecdotal observations, assumptions deeply embedded in the design of languages and tools, reviews of empirical evidence on programming, and applications of existing theories from psychology and related areas. Our aim was to bridge this gulf: formulating deeply-held beliefs into theories which are empirically testable and synthesizing empirical findings in ways that make predictions about programming tools and languages. \n</p> \n <p>\nTo achieve this aim, the seminar had three specific goals. 1) Bring together researchers with diverse expertise to find shared understanding. 2) Create a body of theories which make testable predictions about the effects of programming tools, languages, and pedagogy on developer behavior in specific contexts. 3) Propose future activities which can advance the use of theories, including identifying studies to conduct to test theories and ways to use theories to communicate research findings to industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring this seminar, a few short talks first reviewed the nature, creation, and use of theories as well as existing evidence about developer behavior during programming activities. The main activity of the seminar was working in small groups to sketch new theories of programming.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar Overview</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar was divided into the following sessions across four days in June 2022:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Tuesday: welcome, what is theory, describing theories, critiquing theories</li>\n<li> Wednesday: brainstorming unexplained programming phenomena, sketching theories, getting feedback on theories, and refining theories</li>\n<li> Thursday: presenting theory sketches, discussing ways of sharing theories, and skeptically examining whether developing theories of programming is really worth the time</li>\n<li> Friday: reflecting on takeaways and departure</li>\n</ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar was organized by Thomas Latoza, Amy J. Ko, Dag Sjoberg, David Shepherd, and Anita Sarma. Anita later had to drop out, leaving Thomas, Amy, Dag, and David as the four organizers who were able to attend.</p> \n <h3>What is Theory?</h3> \n <p>The goal of this opening session was to find common ground on what theory was. To achieve this, each organizer gave short presentations related to theories.\n</p> \n <p>\nThomas identified how researchers used theories to generate falsifiable predictions about the world. He described common characteristics of theories as abstract, explanatory, relevant, and operationalizable. An example of a theory of programming he provided was how violating constraints cause defects or reduces code quality.\n</p> \n <p>\nAmy described an interpretivist framing of theories, where theories were cultural and experience-based. Some theories were folk theories (e.g. code is magic, Not Invented Here, and spaces vs tabs for white space). Some theories were personal, such as programming as common sense machines and tinkering towards correctness. Other theories came from research communities such as ICSE. For example, a theory of programming is that we can copy and adapt code from another location in a program to fix bugs.\n</p> \n <p>\nDag drew guidelines between what was and was not a theory. He identified multiple examples of what were not theories: scientific laws were not theories because they were missing the \"why;\" trivial statements were also not theories. The building blocks of theories included constructs, propositions, explanations, and scope. Theories can help us explain surprising empirical results, while empirical results can help us support or refute certain theories. Finally, Dag noted how premature theorizing is likely to be wrong, but can still be useful.\n</p> \n <p>\nDavid emphasized the importance of keeping theories practical. He defined a relationship from theorems to corollaries to examples and applications. He provided an example of using different representations in music for different use cases and users.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn open discussions and breakout groups, attendees identified additional nuances to theories. We noted how it is useful for theories to enable ease of communication or shared understanding. But by defining a vocabulary, theories can also limit the scope of explanation. We can also use theories to understand what we observe or to justify interventions. Finally, there was discussion about creating theories inductively, deductively, and/or abductively.\n</p> \n <p>\nCommon themes that arose from discussion include how theories are seldom used to justify the design of programming languages and tools, and how programming is a social endeavor and drawing upon social science research (e.g. psychology) can support theory building.\n</p> \n <h3>Expressing Theories using a Theory Template</h3> \n <p>The goal of this session was to try to express theories using a theory template developed by the organizers. While the goal of this template was to support the creation of new theories, attendees used it to describe existing theories for this session. Attendees broke into five groups to attempt to apply the theory template to the following existing theories of programming:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Asking and answering questions [1]</li>\n<li>Program comprehension as fact finding [2]</li>\n<li>Leaky abstractions [3]</li>\n<li>Information hiding [4]</li>\n<li>Theory of programming instruction [5]</li>\n</ul> \n <p>After considering feedback from attendees, organizers revised the theory template. The revised theory template's section headers and helper text are as follows:</p> \n <ol>\n<li><em>Theory's name</em>: Choose a name that is memorable, short, and descriptive.</li>\n<li><em>Summary</em>: In a few sentences, summarize the phenomena, constructs, relationships, and a concrete example, hypothesis, and study.</li>\n<li><em>Contributors</em>: Who has contributed to this theory? Add your name here.</li>\n<li><em>Phenomena</em>: What programming phenomena is your theory trying to explain? And in what scope (people, expertise, contexts, tools, etc.)? This description should just describe what is being explained, should not offer an explanation; that below. (``Programming'' includes any and all interactions between people and code, in any context (e.g., software engineering, learning, play, productivity, science, and all of the activities involved in creating programs, including requirements, architecture, implementation, verification, monitoring, and more).</li>\n<li><em>Prior Work</em>: What prior work offers an explanation of this phenomena, or might help generate an explanation of this phenomena? For the purposes of the seminar, this does not need to be complete, but a complete description of this theory would have an extensive literature review covering theories that inspired this theory, as well as conflicting theories.</li>\n<li><em>Concepts</em>: Describe the key concepts of the theory and some concrete examples of them, building upon the phenomena above. These might be variables, processes, people, aspects of people, structures, contexts or other phenomena that are essential to the theory's account of the phenomena. Note: concepts should be descriptions of ideas that give some structure and precision to describing the phenomena, not operationalizations or measurements - those belong in example hypotheses and/or studies.</li>\n<li><em>Relationships and Mechanisms</em>: Using the constructs described above, explain the causality of how the phenomena works. What causes what and how? Provide a few concrete examples to illustrate the idea.</li>\n<li><em>Example Hypotheses</em>: What testable claims do the constructs, relationships, and mechanisms imply?</li>\n<li><em>Example Studies</em>: What are existing or envisioned example study methods that might investigate the hypotheses above? How might the concepts be operationalized and measured? Describe details about populations, samples, tasks, contexts, tools, observations. Remember that studies can involve many forms of observation and data, both qualitative and quantitative and even design contributions. Studies do not have to be feasible to be proposed and can vary in scope, from single-study sized methods to long-term research agendas that might explore a theory over many years and many projects.</li>\n<li><em>Corollaries</em>: What follows from this theory, if true? Provide potential implications, concrete or otherwise.</li>\n</ol> \n <h3>Unexplained phenomenon</h3> \n <p>After spending the first day discussing what theories were and applying a theory template, the goal of the second day was to identify unexplained phenomena related to programming and apply theories to explain them. After an informal voting process, attendees created groups to develop theories around the following phenomena:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Debugging</li>\n<li>Types</li>\n<li>Neurodiversity in programming</li>\n<li>Data programming</li>\n<li>Code examples</li>\n<li>Developer tools</li>\n<li>Learning effects from code analysis</li>\n</ul> \n <p>Groups spent all of Wednesday developing theories by filling out the theory template and then getting feedback from members of other groups. They then iterated and created presentations. See included abstracts of talks for descriptions of each presentation.\n</p> \n <h3>Sharing Theories</h3> \n <p>On Thursday after the presentations, attendees had discussions about how to share theories of programming to broader audiences. Many ideas included written dissemination, such as publishing research, writing books, creating a wiki, adding to reviewer guidelines, creating a website, defining syllabi for reading groups, speaking on podcasts, and posting on social media sites. Other ideas featured opportunities for further interaction, such as workshops, special interest groups, demonstrations of theories for practitioners, and stickers/flair for engagement at conferences. Other ideas focused on incentive structures, such as creating a ``best new theory'' award at conferences.\n</p> \n <p>\nGroup-wide discussions about sharing theories identified some structural barriers and opportunities. A barrier to broader theory creation and/or use is that most computing researchers do not have much training in theories. Workshops, reading groups, or changes to undergraduate or graduate level coursework could help address this. Another structural barrier is that most conferences lack instructions about theory. Adding instructions in paper calls and reviewer instructions as well as ``theory shepherds'' could help address this systemic barrier.\n</p> \n <h3>Do we really need theories?</h3> \n <p>The final session for Thursday was critically reflective about whether programming actually required theories. Given this session occurred after lunch on the final full day, this session got silly. After splitting into groups to discuss, groups shared eclectic presentations to reflect their discussions:</p> \n <ul>\n<li>a colorful whiteboard diagram about pros and cons of theories (Fig.1)</li>\n<li>Another whiteboard diagram about whether to use theory (Fig. 2)</li>\n<li>A list of bullets about challenges of making changes in publishing</li>\n<li>An humorous improv skit about a conference Q&amp;A session on a theory paper.</li>\n</ul> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0005/5386/whiteboard_theory.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1 Whiteboard sketches of the pros and cons of theories, as depicted by various diagrams.\" src=\"/storage/media/0005/5386/whiteboard_theory.png\" width=\"80%\"/></a> \n <div class=\"caption mt-2 mb-4\"><b>Figure 1</b> Whiteboard sketches of the pros and cons of theories, as depicted by various diagrams.</div> \n <a href=\"/storage/media/0005/5385/whiteboard_appropriate.png\"><img alt=\"Whiteboard sketch of flowchart considering whether a theory is appropriate.\" src=\"/storage/media/0005/5385/whiteboard_appropriate.png\" width=\"80%\"/></a> \n <div class=\"caption mt-2 mb-4\"><b>Figure 1</b> Whiteboard sketch of flowchart considering whether a theory is appropriate.</div> \n <h3>Reflections on the week</h3> \n <p>The final session of this seminar asked attendees to reflect on the seminar as a whole. Attendees identified some high-level takeaways:</p> \n <p>\nAttendees found theories useful for helping understand why things (e.g. languages or tools) do or do not work. They also found theories helpful for differentiating between how we think people work and how they actually work.</p> \n <p>   \nAttendees also felt that the engagement of computing researchers with theories of programming was often limited by the lack of interest and/or lack of expertise. Interdisciplinary research can help create the gestalt of expertise required to create theories of programming, but narrow conference and journal scopes often make this difficult. Specifically, many computing researchers lack expertise in empirical evaluations, making it difficult to develop rigorous evidence that is often foundational to theory building. Furthermore, much training in empirical evaluations focuses on lab settings, whereas most programming happens \"in the wild.\"\n</p> \n <p>\nMultiple attendees also felt that theories were more implicitly prevalent in computing research than was explicitly discussed. Some conversation focused on \"lower case 't\"' theories, or theories that we not fully formalized, but provided use and explanation. Many attendees felt that theories implicitly existing in papers, but were unaware of explanations into this work.\n</p> \n <p>\nA concluding consensus was that theories of programming have existed in the background. Through explicit engagement and discourse, this Dagstuhl Seminar could serve as a catalyst to augment existing theories and craft new ones.</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Sillito, Jonathan, Gail C.

            "title": "Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web",
            "data": "\n <p>In 2001 Berners-Lee et al. stated that \"The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\"\n</p> \n <p>\nThe time since the publication of the paper and creation of the foundations for the Semantic Web can be roughly divided in three phases: The first phase focused on bringing Knowledge Representation to Web Standards, e.g., with the development of OWL. The second phase focused on data management, linked data and potential applications. In the third, more recent phase, with the emergence of real world applications and the Web emerging into devices and things, emphasis is put again on the notion of Knowledge, while maintaining the large graph aspect: Knowledge Graphs have numerous applications like semantic search based on entities and relations, disambiguation of natural language, deep reasoning (e.g. IBM Watson), machine reading (e.g. text summarisation), entity consolidation for Big Data, and text analytics. Others are exploring the application of Knowledge Graphs in industrial and scientific applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe shared characteristic by all these applications can be expressed as a challenge: the capability of combining diverse (e.g. symbolic and statistical) reasoning methods and knowledge representations while guaranteeing the required scalability, according to the reasoning task at hand. Methods include: Temporal knowledge and reasoning, Integrity constraints, Reasoning about contextual information and provenance, Probabilistic and fuzzy reasoning, Analogical reasoning, Reasoning with Prototypes and Defeasible Reasoning, Cognitive Frames, Ontology Design Patterns (ODP), and Neural Networks and other machine learning models.\n</p> \n <p>\nWith this Dagstuhl Seminar, we intend to bring together researchers that have faced and addressed the challenge of combining diverse reasoning methods and knowledge representations in different domains and for different tasks with Knowledge Graphs and Linked Data experts with the purpose of drawing a sound research roadmap towards defining scalable Knowledge Representation and Reasoning principles within a unifying Knowledge Graph framework. Driving questions include:\n</p> <ul>\n<li>What are fundamental Knowledge Representation and Reasoning methods for Knowledge Graphs?\n</li><li> How should the various Knowledge Representation, logical symbolic reasoning, as well as statistical inference methods be combined and how should they interact?\n</li><li> What are the roles of ontologies for Knowledge Graphs?\n</li><li> How can existing data be ingested into a Knowledge Graph?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nIn order to answer these questions, the present seminar was aiming at cross-fertilisation between research on different Knowledge Representation mechanisms, and also to help to identify the requirements for Knowledge Representation research originating from the deployment of Knowledge graphs and the discovery of new research problems motivated by applications. \nWe foresee, from the results summarised in the present report, the establishment of a new research direction, which focuses on how to combine the results from knowledge representation research in several subfields for joint use for Knowledge Graphs and Data on the Web.\n</p> \n <h3>The Seminar</h3> \n <p>The idea of this seminar emerged when the organisers got together discussing about writing a grant proposal. They all shared, although from different perspectives, the conviction that research on Semantic Web (and its scientific community) reached a critical point: it urged a paradigm shift. After almost two decades of research, the Semantic Web community established a strong identity and achieved important results. Nevertheless, the technologies resulting from its effort on the one hand have proven the potential of the Semantic web vision, but on the other hand became an impediment; a limiting constraint towards the next major breakthrough. In particular, Semantic Web knowledge representation models are insufficient to face many important challenges such as supporting artificial intelligence systems in showing advanced reasoning capabilities and socially-sound behaviour at scale. \nThe organisers soon realised that a project proposal was not the ideal tool for addressing this problem, which instead needed a confrontation of the Semantic Web scientific community with other relevant actors, in the field. From this discussion, the \"knowledge graph\" concept emerged as a key unifying ingredient for this new form of knowledge representation - embracing both the Semantic Web, but also other adjacent communities - and it was agreed that a Dagstuhl seminar on \"Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web\" was a perfect means for the purpose. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe list of invitees to the seminar included scientists from both academia and industry working on knowledge graphs, linked data, knowledge representation, machine learning, automated reasoning, natural language processing, data management, and other relevant areas. Forty people have participated in the seminar, which was very productive. The active discussions during plenary and break out sessions confirmed the complex nature of the proposed challenge. \nThis report is a fair representative of the variety and complexity of the addressed topics. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe method used for organising the seminar deserves further elaboration.\nThe seminar had a five-day agenda. Half of the morning on the first day was devoted to ten short talks (5 minutes each) given by a selection of attendees. \nThe speakers were identified by the organisers as representatives of complimentary topics based on the result of a Survey conducted before the seminar: more than half of the invitees filled a questionnaire that gave them the opportunity to briefly express their perspectives on the topic and to point out relevant challenges that they would put in their future research agenda with the highest priority. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of these short speeches was to ignite the confrontation by sharing the emerging views on the main challenges from this survey.\nAfter the speeches we organised the further discussion in an \"Open Space\" session that served to collaboratively build the agenda for the rest of the day (and that influenced the agenda of the next days). \nThe open space method consists of giving everyone the opportunity to propose one or more break out topics. \nTo propose a topic, a proposer had to explain in few words what it was about, then write it down on a post-it that was attached on a blackboard (see Figure 1). At the end of the session, attendees were invited to sign up for the topics of their interest (by marking the corresponding post-it).\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3850/OpenSpace.jpg\" width=\"70%\"/> \n <p>\nThe more popular ones (up to fifteen and having at least three sign ups) were selected to compose the agenda.  Each break out session used a one-hour slot during the afternoon.  The second day continued with most of the break out sessions with the aim of continuing the discussion started the first day and work towards consolidating a report (finalised on the fourth day). \nReports would reflect view and vision emerging from the break out group. \nOn the same day attendees had the opportunity to self-propose to give additional short speeches, addressing missing relevant topics. \nWe used part of the second day's morning for these speeches. \nWe explicitly asked attendees to avoid speeches on \"my research\" and to only address relevant challenges that were overlooked so far. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the third day we started with a plenary discussion and the seminar group agreed on splitting into four groups to discuss \"Grand challenges\" separately, then share the results before going back to the break out sessions. \nThe aim was to share a common high level vision reference before consolidating the more specific discussions that were ongoing in the break out sessions. \nOn the fourth day, the seminar group split again in break out sessions including a \"Grand challenges\" one. Each session was assigned to at least two coordinators, who committed to consolidate in a draft report the results from the previous meetings. It was decided to merge a few topics, when appropriate. \n</p> \n <p>\nBreak out sessions had varied level of technical abstraction depending on the nature of the topic, and its level of maturity within the state of the art. \nTo give some examples: the break out session about \"Grand challenges\" mainly discussed a vision for a future research agenda and maintained a high level of abstraction, while the session on \"Human and Social Factors in Knowledge Graphs\" provided more concrete insights as it could build on both academic and industrial research results, projects and practical experiences. \nThe session on \"Applications of Knowledge Graphs\" focused on technical details and issues on two relevant sample applications.\n</p> \n <h3>Overview of the Report</h3> \n <p>\nThis report is organised in two main parts: Section 3 includes a list of abstracts providing an overview of the short speeches that we had the first two days. All the other sections are consolidated reports of the emerging vision, research challenges, possible research agenda, and proposed approaches, from break out sessions. When applicable, the reports give an overview of specific relevant research work.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Piero Andrea Bonatti, Michael Cochez, Stefan Decker, Axel Polleres, and Valentina Presutti\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Quantum Cryptanalysis",
            "data": "\n <h3>Motivation and scope</h3> \n <p>\nLike its predecessors, this fourth installment of a Dagstuhl seminar on <em>Quantum Cryptanalysis</em> was devoted to studying cryptographic solutions that might be suitable for standardization in the post-quantum setting and to studying quantum attacks against currently deployed cryptographic solutions. Two main thrusts were of particular interest:\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Algorithmic innovation.</b> Quantum resources can be used in various way for attacking cryptographic solutions, and the seminar included multiple presentations on exploiting quantum resources for cryptanalytic purposes. Both attacks on symmetric and asymmetric primitives were considered, and there were lively discussions on the feasibility of mounting particular types of attacks. Complementing the presentations on quantum attacks, the program included presentations on advanced classical algorithms, raising the question of identifying possibilities to speed up such classical attack venues through quantum \"subroutines.\"\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Quantum resource estimation.</b> It goes without saying that  asymptotic improvements are of great interest when trying to tackle computational  problems underpinning the security of cryptographic constructions. However, when looking at an actually deployed scheme, quantifying the exact resources (such as the number of qubits) needed by an attacker is relevant to judge the practical impact of a proposed attack strategy. The seminar included presentations on the estimation of resources for attacking some prominent cryptographic schemes.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs expected from a seminar with this title, many talks were indeed devoted to cryptanalysis, but the program also included presentations on establishing provable security guarantees in a post-quantum scenario. With the field becoming more mature, we did not schedule much time for survey talks. However, we did include a presentation on the emph{status of the development of quantum computers} in the program, thereby helping to get a better idea of potential obstacles when trying to implement quantum cryptanalytic attacks.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization</h3> \n <p>\nThis was the fourth Dagstuhl seminar devoted entirely to quantum cryptanalysis, and as in the prior editions the set of participants included both experts in quantum algorithms and experts in classical cryptography. Some of the participants had already participated in earlier editions of this seminar series, but a number of colleagues attended such a seminar - or any Dagstuhl event - for the first time. In total, we had 42 participants from academia, government, and industry. This time we also included an open problem session in the program, which will hopefully help to stimulate further work in this vibrant research area. In the schedule we tried to leave sufficient time for discussions and for collaborative work in smaller groups. In line with the Dagstuhl tradition, no presentations were scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, and the seminar participants could devote the afternoon to a hike, an excursion, or to their research.\n</p> \n <h3>Results and next steps</h3> \n <p>\nOver the course of the years, communication and collaboration between the classical cryptographic and the quantum algorithmic research communities has intensified, and many colleagues cross traditional discipline boundaries. As evidenced in the seminar, available quantum cryptanalytic results can go well beyond asymptotic statements and include rather fine-grained resource counts. The seminar covered the analysis of both symmetric and asymmetric primitives, and ongoing efforts toward standardizing quantum-safe cryptographic solutions are likely to stimulate more progress, in particular on the quantum cryptanalysis of asymmetric cryptographic primitives.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michele Mosca, Nicolas Sendrier, Rainer Steinwandt, and Krysta Svore\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Multi-Level Modelling",
            "data": "\n <p>\nMulti-Level Modeling (MLM), i.e., the explicit exploitation of multiple levels of classification when modeling, represents a significant extension to the traditional two-level object-oriented paradigm with the potential to dramatically improve upon the utility, reliability and complexity level of models. It therefore has benefits in many domains of modeling such as software engineering, process modeling and enterprise modeling. Research into multi-level modeling has increased significantly over the last few years, manifesting itself in lively debates in the literature, four international workshops (MULTI 2014--2017), a published journal theme issue (SoSyM), a special issue for the EMISA journal (in preparation), and a growing number of tools and languages. While the enthusiasm around MLM provides momentum to this promising research area, the recent speed of growth and the focus on exploring new language features has raised some challenges, including the following:\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>growing diversity of approaches</b> On the one hand diversity is welcome in order to spawn a competition of ideas but on the other hand it can slow down the approach's growth and industry adoption unless steps are taken to consolidate ideas and bundle resources.\n</p> \n <p><b>lack of integration with related disciplines</b> In particular, ontology engineering has overlapping application areas and could form a powerful synergy with MLM due to its complementary strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, areas such as logic, philosophy, and linguistics are also highly relevant for the further advancement of MLM. \n</p> \n <p><b>neglect of real world applications</b> It is natural to initially focus on core principles when developing a new approach, but at some point it becomes important to make the transition into industrial practice in order to validate claims about the utility and need for MLM, and to promote the uptake of MLM in new domains and industries.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>\nIn order to address the aforementioned challenges the seminar brought together researchers and industry practitioners from the areas of conceptual modeling, ontologies, and formal foundations. In particular, to further the coherence of future research into multi-level modeling, we aimed at\n</p> <ul>\n<li> having some consolidating discussion on terminology and scope;\n</li><li> strengthening (formal) foundations; and\n</li><li> identifying objective criteria for comparing competing approaches, e.g., by developing respective benchmarks in cooperation with modelers from industry. \n</li></ul> \n <h3>Working Groups</h3> \n <p>\nA talk on \"What is Multi-Level Modeling?\" by Thomas K\u00fchne (cf. talk abstract) set the stage for the terminology discussion and presented results from a survey that the organizers ran prior to the seminar. The survey results were in good agreement with the ideas the talk put forward in terms of what core multi-level modeling concepts are, such as \"multiple levels of abstraction\", \"classification as the core abstraction principle\", \"modeling the real world\" (as opposed to engineering languages). The survey design carefully avoided introducing bias, hence there were no multiple-choice questions on subjects like this one. The lack of answer standardization required a manual allocation into answer categories such as the aforementioned ones, but only clear cut cases were counted. Overall, there was very little controversy over what multi-level modeling constitutes. Furthermore, the survey nicely confirmed that the initial seminar goals were congruent with what most participants found to be interesting and important work in the area of multi-level modeling. \n</p> \n <p>\nTwo further talks were aimed at supporting the formation of working groups:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> A talk on foundations and ontologies by Jo\u00e3o Paulo A. Almeida contrasted ontology engineering to language engineering, asked which questions should be addressed by a foundation, and explored some answers. \n</li><li> A talk on applications by Ulrich Frank elaborated on challenges for multi-level modeling in practical applications. \n</li></ol> \n <p>\nSubsequently four working groups were established by identifying the themes that both aligned with the original workshop goals and garnered the highest interest among participants. \n</p> \n <p>\nA working group on \"Foundations\" formed and decided to start on investigating which ontological commitments and metaphysical choices may be required or useful for a foundation of multi-level modeling (cf. \"Foundations\" group report, 4.1).\n</p> \n <p>\nA working group on \"Applications\" set out to identify promising application domains for MLM, find common properties for such application domains, identify anticipated benefits of MLM, and determine evaluation criteria for MLM methods (cf. \"Applications\" group report, 4.2). \n</p> \n <p>\nA further working group on \"Dynamic Aspects\" focused on a sub-area of enterprise modeling, i.e., modeling process-related and/or dynamic behavior aspects (cf. \"Dynamic Aspects\" group report, 4.3). \n</p> \n <p>\nWe strove to both address the originally planned goals of the seminar but also to allow new goals to be formed, based on the final composition of the participants. As a result, the group formation process yielded one more group that focused on transformations in the context of multi-level modeling (cf. \"Transformations'' group report, 4.4). \n</p> \n <p>\nDue to the overlap between foundation work and the area of \"integration with ontologies\", a group dedicated exclusively to exploring synergies between MLM and ontology engineering did not emerge. We are hopeful that the working group on \"Foundations\" will explore more of the synergy aspect in future collaborations.\n</p> \n <h3>Industry Focus</h3> \n <p>\nAs closing the gap between academia and industry with respect to multi-level modeling was a primary goal of the seminar, we had a total of six talks by industry representatives. These talks gave the speakers an opportunity to explain actual needs, set challenges, comment on utility, etc., plus allowed the audience to inquire about hurdles for adoption, etc. Please see the industry talk abstracts included in this report for further details. \n</p> \n <p>\nWe, the organizers, are extremely grateful to the staff of Dagstuhl for providing a perfect seminar venue and to the participants who not only made this seminar a success but also provided a wealth of generous positive feedback.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jo\u00e3o Paulo Almeida, Colin Atkinson, Ulrich Frank, and Thomas K\u00fchne\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "The Logical Execution Time Paradigm: New Perspectives for Multicore Systems",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Logical Execution Time (LET) abstraction, which was originally introduced as a real-time programming paradigm, has gained traction recently in the automotive industry with the shift to multicore architectures. The objective of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to investigate new opportunities and challenges raised by the use of LET as a basis for implementing parallel execution of control software.\n</p> \n <p>\nLET abstracts from the actual timing behavior of real-time tasks on the physical platform: Independent of when a task executes, the time interval between its reading input and writing output is fixed by the LET. This introduces a separation between functionality on the one hand, and mapping and scheduling on the other hand. It also provides a clean interface between the timing model used by the control engineer and that of the software engineer.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe LET paradigm was considered until recently by the automotive industry as not efficient enough in terms of buffer space and timing performance. The shift to embedded multicore processors has represented a game changer: The design and verification of multicore systems is a challenging area of research that is still very much in progress. Predictability clearly is a crucial issue which cannot be tackled without changes in the design process. Several OEMs and suppliers have come to the conclusion that LET might be a key enabler and a standardization effort is already under way in the automotive community to integrate LET into AUTOSAR.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds to discuss and sketch solutions to the problems raised by the use of LET in multicore systems, with a focus on the automotive domain. The program was structured around the following topics: (i) Implementations of LET; (ii) LET and related paradigms; (iii) LET and control; (iv) Future directions of LET. The fruitful discussions covered the following issues:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>LET was designed as a programming paradigm but is now being used as a mechanism for predictable communication. How can the principles of LET be adapted accordingly? How should LET values be chosen?\n</li><li> LETs act as deadlines for tasks, which means that they must be dimensioned for the worst-case response time of tasks. This may be too inefficient in practice. Alternatives exist where a bounded number of deadline misses may be tolerated. How should LET exceptions (violations of the specified LET) be handled then? How can deadline miss patterns which still guarantee functional correctness (e.g., system stability) be established?\n</li><li> How should the LET constructs be integrated into AUTOSAR? More generally, how should the design and verification process in the automotive industry be modified to integrate the LET paradigm?\n</li><li> How does the use of the LET paradigm for multicore systems fit into the more general context of achieving predictability of multicore systems? \n</li></ul> \n <p>This seminar provided a unique opportunity for participants from the automotive industry to get feedback from academia on their effort to adopt the LET paradigm. At the same time, it allowed other participants to confront their own models and/or solutions with industrial reality and identify new research challenges. This seminar furthermore brought together research communities which do not so often interact with each other, e.g. the synchronous, control and real-time communities.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization of the seminar</h3> \n <p>The seminar took place from 25th to 28th February 2018. The first day started with an introduction by the organizers, followed by a talk from one of the co-founders of the LET paradigm -- Christoph Kirsch. The following two sessions included talks providing an industrial view on the challenges of implementing LET in the multi-core automotive setting. The first day continued with a session comprised of talks presenting the academic view on LET-related challenges, and concluded with breakout sessions (detailed below). The second day of the seminar started with two sessions in which LET was compared to related paradigms, such as the synchronous model. The afternoon talks focused on the connection between LET and control as well as on a possible application of the LET approach to the domain of graphical processing units. The second day concluded with another set of breakout sessions. The third day included talks exploring future directions of LET, and a final set of breakout sessions.\n</p> \n <p>\nBreakout sessions led to very interesting and fruitful discussions, and covered, among others, the following aspects:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Dimensioning of LET intervals:</b> The main focus was on how to efficiently dimension LET intervals to fit specific applications, which is currently a very pragmatic and experience based activity. Moreover, the two uses of LET in the automotive setting were identified: (i)~Functional LET and (ii)~Implementation LET. \n\n</li><li><b>Buffer optimization within LET:</b> The main focus was on the management of buffers in a LET-based implementation. The following topics were identified as relevant and thus discussed: minimizing the number of used buffers, strategies to handle memory contentions when accessing buffers, location of buffers in the memory hierarchy of hardware platforms and locality affinities between buffers, impact of spatial partitioning or periodicity of LET frames (harmonic or not) the buffers.\n\n</li><li><b>The synchronous approach vs LET:</b> The focus was on the comparison between the synchronous and LET models, with a discussion of their advantages and limitations, and their positioning in the context of the needs of the automotive industry, with a special emphasis on a transition from a singlecore to a multicore setting.\n\n</li><li><b>Control and LET:</b> The main focus was on the use of the LET paradigm to implement controllers. The following topics were identified as relevant and thus discussed: Is LET the correct paradigm for controller implementation? What is a viable period choice? How are potential deadline misses handled? Can a proper fault model be conveniently incorporated into the LET methodology? Can LET lead to new contributions in the control research domain?\n</li></ul> \n <p>More details on breakout sessions are available in a dedicated section of this document, after the overview of the talks given during the seminar.\n</p> \n <h4>Outcome of the seminar</h4> \n <p>\nThe seminar has already enabled several collaborations: (i) a white paper on the topic is under preparation; (ii) a special session at EMSOFT'18 will be proposed. In addition, since participants expressed very positive opinions about the seminar and were in favor of reproducing the experience, a follow-up seminar will be considered.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, as organizers, we would like to thank all of the participants for their strong interaction, interesting talks, fruitful group discussions, and work on open problems.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Rolf Ernst, Stefan Kuntz, Martin Simons, Borislav Nikolic, Sophie Quinton, and Hermann von Hasseln\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nAcross science, engineering, medicine and business we face a deluge of data coming from sensors, from simulations, or from the activities of myriads of individuals on the Internet. The data often has a geometric character, as is the case with 1D GPS traces, 2D images, 3D scans, and so on. Furthermore, the data sets we collect are frequently highly correlated, reflecting information about the same or similar entities in the world, or echoing semantically important repetitions/symmetries or hierarchical structures common to both man-made and natural objects.\n</p> \n <p>\nA recent trend, emerging independently in multiple theoretical and applied communities is to understand geometric data sets through their relations and interconnections, a point of view that can be broadly described as exploiting the <em>functoriality</em> of data, which has a long tradition associated with it in mathematics. Functoriality, in its broadest form, is the notion that in dealing with any kind of mathematical object, it is at least as important to understand the transformations or symmetries possessed by the object or the family of objects to which it belongs, as it is to study the object itself. This general idea been successfully applied in a large variety of fields, both theoretical and practical, often leading to deep insights into the structure of various objects as well as to elegant and efficient methods in various application domains, including computational geometry, computer vision and computer graphics. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought together researchers and practitioners interested in notions of <em>similarity</em>, <em>correspondence</em> and, more generally, <em>relations</em> across geometric data sets. Mathematical and computational tools for the construction, analysis, and exploitation of such relational networks were the central focus of this seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mirela Ben-Chen, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chazal, Leonidas J.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe goal of Inductive Programming (IP) is to provide methods for induction of computer programs from data. Specifically, IP is the automated (or semi-automated) generation of a computer program from an incomplete information, such as input-output examples, demonstrations, or computation traces.IP offers powerful approaches to learning from relational data and to learning from observations in the context of autonomous intelligent agents. IP is a form of machine learning, because an IP system should perform better given more data (i.e. more examples or experience). However, in contrast to standard ML approaches, IP approaches typically only need a small number of training examples. Furthermore, induced hypotheses are typically represented as logic or functional programs, and can therefore be inspected by a human. In that sense, IP is a type of interpretable machine learning which goes beyond the expressivity of other approaches of rule learning such as decision tree algorithms. IP is also a form of program synthesis. It complements deductive and transformational approaches. When specific algorithm details are difficult to determine, IP can be used to generate candidate programs from either user-provided data, such as test cases, or from data automatically derived from a formal specification. Most relevant application areas of IP techniques is end-user programming and data wrangling.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar has been the fifth in a series - building on seminars 13502, 15442, 17383, and 19202. \nIn the wake of the recent interest in deep learning approaches, mostly for end-to-end learning, it has been recognized that for practical applications, especially  in critical domains, data-intensive blackbox machine learning must be complemented with methods which can help to overcome problems with data quality, missing or errouneous labeling of training data, as well as providing transparency and comprehensibility of learned models. To address these requirements, on the one hand, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) emerged as a new area of research and on the other hand, there is a new interest in bringing together learning and reasoning. These two areas of research are in the focus of the 2021 seminar. Futhermore, recent developments to scale up IP methods to be more applicable to complex real world domains has been taken into account. Based on outcomes of the fourth seminar (19202), the potential of IP as powerful approach for explainable artificial intelligence (\"IP for XAI\") has been be elaborated. Bringing together IP methods and deep learning approaches contributes to neural-symbolic intergration research. While two years ago (seminar 19202) focus has been on IP as interpretable surrogate model, in the 2021 seminar explainability of different addressees of explanations and their need to different types of explanations (e.g. verbal or example-based) are considered.\nFor many real world applications, it is necessary to involve the human as teacher and judge for the machine learned models. Therefore, a further topic of the seminar has been to explore IP in the context of new approaches to interactive ML and their applications to automating data science and joint human-computer decision making.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Andrew Cropper, Luc De Raedt, Richard Evans, and Ute Schmid\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nLinear relationships between quantities are one of the most fundamental and pervasive phenomena in mathematics, science and computing. While matrices encode linear relationships between exactly two quantities, tensors are an abstraction representing linear relationships between multiple variables. Tensor computations therefore provide an abstract language for computations that span an enormous range of application domains, including machine learning, quantum information systems, simulations based on solving partial differential equations, computational chemistry and beyond.  The tensor abstraction enriches our understanding of the structure of computations, and exposes common challenges and solutions that cut across different research communities. \n</p> \n <p>\nWhile the mathematics of tensors is well-developed and extensively applied across all of these applications and beyond, there is far less commonality in the software abstractions and tools deployed to execute tensor computations. This is in stark contrast to matrix computations, where common abstractions and stable interfaces have led to widely used tools that bring high performance to across diverse application domains.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Seminar explored this challenge, and made significant progress towards establishing foundations for common implementations -- embodying the substantial body of knowledge on high-performance tensor computation strategies in common software libraries and domain-specific program generation tools.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Seminar began with five tutorial lectures, offered by the organisers in partnership with selected leading figures in some of the relevant communities.  We began by mapping some of the diverse terminology.  We then provided tutorials exposing the quantitative and qualitative diversity in how different communities use tensor computations -- aiming to build a common understanding of key concepts, notations, and building blocks.  We focused on the following application areas:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li>Quantum physics and chemistry\n</li><li> Mesh-based discretisations for solution of partial differential equations\n</li><li> Machine learning.\n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThe final tutorial reviewed the challenge of establishing unifying software tools, highlighting the enormous body of work that has been done within application areas.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe second phase of the Seminar consisted of more detailed presentations from the participants.  These included motivating applications, but focusing on the fundamental computational workloads, methods, and performance challenges.  Building on this, we also had contributions focused on implementation -- low-level performance considerations, algorithmic proposals, compiler algorithms and compiler infrastructure.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the third phase of the Seminar, we separated into three teams.  One explored benchmarking and datasets, another made substantial progress on proof-of-concept implementation work to connecting  the high-level Tensorly library for tensor decompositions in machine learning to a lower-level tensor-vector products -- achieving considerable performance advantage.  Finally there was also a major and continuing effort to define a common domain-specific language and compiler representation for tensor contractions that supports both high-level optimisations and the use of high-performance low-level libraries.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis 2021 seminar built on progress made at an earlier seminar with the same title, in March 2020 -- which was very heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.  This seminar was also affected, to a lesser extent -- with a reduced number of on-site participants, partly compensated by very useful engagement with researchers joining online, albeit from distant timezones.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar benefited from broader engagement with application domains -- partly as a result of the work that was done on tutorials -- which we hope to publish in due course.  It also benefited from deeper engagement with developers of high-performance building blocks.  Finally, we initiated a new and continuing effort to define a common language and a common intermediate language for code generation tools.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Paolo Bientinesi, David Ham, Furong Huang, Paul H.

            "title": "Foundations of Composite Event Recognition",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis report contains the program and outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 20071 on \"Foundations of Composite Event Recognition\" held at Schloss Dagstuhl, Leibniz Center for Informatics, during February 9-14, 2020.\n</p> \n <p>\nComposite Event Recognition (CER for short) refers to the activity of detecting patterns in streams of continuously arriving \"event\" data over, possibly geographically, distributed sources. CER is a key ingredient of many contemporary Big Data applications that require the processing of such event streams in order to obtain timely insights and implement reactive and proactive measures. Examples of such applications include the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes, human activities on video content, emerging stories and trends on the Social Web, traffic and transport incidents in smart cities, error conditions in smart energy grids, violations of maritime regulations, cardiac arrhythmia, and epidemic spread. In each application, CER allows to make sense of streaming data, react accordingly, and prepare for counter-measures.\n</p> \n <p>\nCER systems become increasingly important as we move from an information economy to an \"intelligent economy\", where it is not only the accessibility to information that matters but also the ability to analyse, reason, and act upon information, creating competitive advantage in commercial transactions, enabling sustainable management of communities, and promoting appropriate distribution of social, healthcare, and educational services. Current businesses tend to be unable to make sense of the amounts of data that are generated by the increasing number of distributed data sources that are becoming available daily, and rely more and more on CER.  As an example, traffic management in smart cities requires the analysis of data from an increasing number of sensors, both mobile (mounted on public transport vehicles and private cars) and stationary (installed on intersections). Using such data streams, CER may be used to detect or even forecast traffic congestions, thus allowing for proactively changing traffic light policies and speed limits, with the aim of reducing carbon emissions, optimising public transportation, and improving the quality of life and productivity of commuters. As another example, in smart energy grids, streaming information from power grid elements sensors, end-user devices, and diverse other sources such as weather forecasts and event schedules can be combined through CER to improve the grid efficiency and meet the rapidly increasing electricity demand.\n</p> \n <p>\nNumerous CER systems and languages have been proposed in the literature. While these systems have a common goal, they differ in their architectures, data models, pattern languages, and processing mechanisms, resulting in many heterogeneous implementations with sometimes fundamentally different capabilities. Their comparative assessment is further hindered by the fact that they have been developed in different communities, each bringing in their own terminology and view of the problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, the established CER literature focuses on the practical system aspects of CER. As a result, little work has been done on its formal foundations. Consequently, and in contrast to the situation for more traditional fields in Computer Science, we currently lack a common understanding of the trade-offs between expressiveness and complexity in the design of CER systems, as well as an established theory for comparing their fundamental capabilities.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs such, currently, CER frameworks are difficult to understand, extend and generalise. It is unclear which of the proposed approaches better meets the requirements of a given application domain, in terms of capturing the intended meaning of the composite events of interest, as well as detecting them efficiently.  Furthermore, the lack of foundations makes it hard to leverage established results -- from automata theory, temporal logics, etc -- thus hindering scientific and technological progress in CER.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the same time, recent years have witnessed increased activities in diverse fields of Computer Science on topics that are related to CER: Inductive and deductive reasoning over streaming data, a field known as Stream Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence. Theoretical complexity results related to processing database queries under updates, associated with advances in Incremental View Maintenance in Database Research. Expressiveness and complexity of logics in the dynamic setting, in Logic research.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together 39 researchers and practitioners working in domains that are strictly related to CER. The first days of the seminar mainly focused on tutorials and talks that gave an overview of the approaches, techniques, methodologies, and vocabularies used in different communities to refer to CER problems. In particular, the following tutorials were presented:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Applications and requirements for CER\n</li><li> CER in data management\n</li><li> CER in distributed event-based systems\n</li><li> Stream reasoning\n</li><li> CER in logic and AI\n</li><li> CER in business process management\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar continued by alternating sessions with focused research talks and group discussions on the following topics, that the participants identified as the most relevant for future investigations and research efforts:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> CER language formalisms\n</li><li> Towards a common framework for CER expressiveness and complexity\n</li><li> Evaluation strategies: parallel and distributed processing\n</li><li> Uncertainty in CER\n</li><li> Pattern induction and composite event forecasting\n</li><li> Benchmarking\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe final sessions of the seminar focused on reporting the results of the group discussions and in planning follow-up activities, including co-organized workshops and events, joint publications, and projects.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Alessandro Margara, Alexander Artikis, Thomas Eiter, and Stijn Vansummeren\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Formal Methods of Transformations",
            "data": "\n <p>The Dagstuhl seminar 17142 ``Formal Methods of Transformations'' was a short two and half day seminar that took place from April 3rd to 5th, 2017.\nThe aim of this seminar was to bring together researchers working on theory and applications of\nformal models of transformations (also known as transductions) of strings and trees. A model of transformation which has been central in this seminar is that of a transducer, i.e., an automaton extended with output. Transducers were introduced in the 1960s as formal models for linguistics and syntax-directed translation in compilers. Today, research on string and tree transducers is an active field with various new applications in databases, document processing, natural language processing, software engineering, and verification.\nTo make the seminar more focused, we had identified six research directions as key topics for the seminar:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Canonical Normal Forms: it is well-known that regular languages admit a unique minimal (and canonical) deterministic finite automaton. Similarly, is it possible to characterize classes of transformations by canonical normal form for transducers?\n\n</li><li>Transducer-Logic Relationships: there are well-known automata-logic correspondences in the theory of languages. What is known for transformations and can we obtain similar connections?\n\n</li><li>Subclass Definability: a fundamental question, which requires a deep understanding of the manipulated objects, is that of subclass definability: given (an effective description of) an object in some class $C$, does this object belong to a given subclass $C'$ of $C$? What are the recent results and open problems with respect to subclass definability for transformations?\n\n</li><li>New Decidability Results: what are the recent decidability breakthroughs in the theory of transformations and what are the important open problems?\n\n</li><li>New Transducer Models: is there a need for new transducer models tailored to new applications?\n\n</li><li>Model-Checking Data-Centric Systems: what are the potential applications of transducer theory to the verification of systems that transform data?\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar gave a large overview of recent results and open problems with respect to these research directions. It was a follow-up of Dagstuhl seminar 13192 \"Tree Transducers and Formal Methods\", which now included researchers on string transducers. String transducers have indeed received a lot of attention in the recent years and new important results have been obtained. The aim of this seminar was also to gather researchers from the string and tree transducer communities. There were 31 participants from 10 countries (Sweden, France, Poland, Germany, US, Belgium, UK, Japan, Portugal, and India). These participants were invited by the organizers Emmanuel Filiot, Sebastian Maneth, and Helmut Seidl to give survey talks and shorter talks on their current research. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with a survey talk by Emmanuel Filiot on recent results on string transformations, intended to motivate the need to address the theory of string transformations in this seminar, and to introduce some of its main recent breakthroughs. Mikolaj Bojanczyk then gave a survey talk on the notion of <em>origins</em> in transformations. Origins are inherent to all known transducer models and making them explicit in the semantics of transducers gave rise to new decidability and definability results. Mikolaj's talk was followed by a session on string transducers. Luc Dartois presented a new and expressive logic to define string transformations. The logic offers good decidability properties with respect to satisfiability and equivalence (under the origin semantics). String transformations, under the origin semantics, can be seen as sets of graphs, called origin graphs. Bruno Guillon presented a characterization of the class of origin graphs generated by known string transducer models. Finally, Jacques Sakarovitch closed this session by presenting a contribution, and an open problem, on rational base numeration systems and their analysis by means of automata and transducers. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe afternoon session started with a survey talk by Christof L\u00f6ding on the automatic synthesis of deterministic transducers of strings and trees, from specifications given by non-deterministic transducers. This problem, called the uniformization problem, can be seen as a variant of the classical Church synthesis problem. Two short talks given by Nathan Lhote and Micha\u00ebl Cadilhac presented their recent contributions on definability problems for string transducers. Nathan Lhote presented decidability results for checking whether a given rational function is first-order definable, and, more generally, whether it is definable by some string transducer whose (input) transition monoid (which disregards the outputs) belongs to some given class, thus lifting to transformations well-known results from the theory of regular languages. Micha\u00ebl Cadilhac then introduced the notion of C-continuity for string transformations and showed effectiveness of this notion for particular classes C. This notion gives an alternative and machine-independent way, which also takes outputs into account, of defining meaningful subclasses of transformations. \n</p> \n <p>\nDay 2 (morning) was a session devoted to applications. It started with a survey talk on symbolic transducers, by Margus Veanes. Symbolic transducers have been introduced to address practical issues when dealing with very large alphabets (even infinite). Transition labels are replaced by predicates defining sets of allowed labels. Fundamental decidability results and practical applications were presented. Based on symbolic string transducers, Loris d'Antoni then presented a fully automatic method to invert a practical class of functional (and injective) transformations, implemented in the tool GENIC. Adrien Boiret then addressed the problem of checking equivalence for symbolic top-down tree transducers. Keisuke Nakano presented some fundamental results on B-terms, which model function composition. Finally, the morning session ended with a talk by Olivier Carton about the notion of infinite word compression by transducers and its relation to normality. \n</p> \n <p>\nAndreas Maletti started the afternoon session with a survey talk on tree transducers and their applications in linguistics. He presented transducer models well-suited to some linguistic applications such as automatic natural language translation, and showed a comparison with deep learning approaches. Frank Drewes then discussed the notion of graph transformations, and especially of DAGs, and proposed in his talk a definition of DAG transducers. Motivated by natural-language interface applications, Johanna Bj\u00f6rklund presented a study of the expressivity of checking stack transducers, which extend with outputs the well-known model of checking stack automata. Day 2 ended with a talk by Helmut Seidl on a result obtained together with Sebastian Maneth and Gregor Kemper on the decidability of equivalence for deterministic top-down tree-to-string transducers, which had been a long standing open problem. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe last day was dedicated to results on the class of string transformations defined by two-way transducers, mostly definability problems.\nThere were two talks, one by Olivier Gauwin and one by Jean-Marc Talbot, presenting two different techniques, for deciding whether a transformation in this class can be defined by a one-way transducers, i.e., is rational. It was open whether this problem was solvable in elementary time, and the two presented approaches answer this question positively. Another definability problem about the minimization of the number of registers in subclasses of SSTs (a model introduced by Alur and Cerny, with the same expressivity as two-way transducers), was discussed by Pierre-Alain Reynier. Isma\u00ebl Jecker presented a class of transducers with strong constraints on their structures, but still as expressive as too-way transducers, and at the same time enjoying many good algorithmic properties, in particular improving by one exponential a famous result by Hopcroft and Ullman. Finally, Krishna S. concluded the seminar by sketching an alternative proof of a result by Alur et. al. on regular expressions for string transformations.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe had long after-lunch breaks (till 4pm) to give the opportunity to the participants to discuss. It was greatly appreciated by the participants, and some of them initiated new collaborations. The discussions inspired new ideas and we hope that joint papers will be published by the participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe warmly thank Schloss Dagstuhl for making this fruitful event possible, and for their help in the organization. It is highly appreciated as organizers, and allowed us to focus only on the scientific aspects of the seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Emmanuel Filiot, Sebastian Maneth, and Helmut Seidl\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Federated Semantic Data Management",
            "data": "\n <p>The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web in which <em>structured data and its meaning</em> is represented in a form that can be readily accessed and exploited by machines. The foundation of this representation is a graph-based data model defined by the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This framework allows for data management approaches that focus on manipulating and using data in terms of its meaning. We refer to this type of data management as <em>semantic data management</em>. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to centralized access to RDF datasets, Web-based protocols such as the SPARQL protocol enable software clients to access or to query RDF datasets made available by remote servers. By integrating such remote data sources as members of a <em>federated system</em>, software clients may answer cross-dataset queries without having to retrieve various datasets into a single repository. Given such a federation, the complexity of problems of query processing and semantic data management increases due to additional parameters such as variable data transfer delays, a changing availability of federation members, the size of the federation, and distribution criteria followed to place and semantically link data in different datasets of the federation. Moreover, whenever data is replicated across federations, synchronization is required to ensure that all changes are propagated and the semantics of data is preserved. Despite a large number of technologies developed by the Semantic Web and Database communities to address problems of semantic data management, we still observe a significant lack of efficient and effective solutions to the problems of federated semantic data management (FSDM), which prevents the development of real-world applications on top of Semantic Web technologies. Additionally, existing proposals to evaluate such solutions do not sufficiently cover the large number of parameters that affect FSDM and the complexity of tradeoffs. More specifically, variables and configurations that considerably affect the federated semantic data management problems are not sufficiently defined or even considered in state-of-the-art testbeds~(e.g., network latency, data fragmentation and replication, query properties, or frequency of updates).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of the Dagstuhl seminar was to gather experts from the Semantic Web and Database communities, together with experts from application areas, to discuss in-depth open issues that have impeded FSDM approaches to be used on a large scale.\n</p> \n <p>The following crucial questions were posed as a basis for the discussions during the~seminar:</p> \n <p><b>Q1</b> <i>Can traditional techniques developed for federations of relational databases be enriched with RDF semantics, and thus provide effective and efficient solutions to problems of FSDM?</i>\n</p> \n <p><b>Q2</b><i>What problems of FSDM present new research challenges that require the definition of novel techniques?</i>\n</p> \n <p><b>Q3</b> <i>What is the role of RDF semantics in the definition of the problems of FSDM?</i>\n</p> \n <p>To discuss these questions the participants of the seminar were grouped according to their areas of expertise and interests. In particular, the seminar focused on four main topic areas~(see below). The results of the group discussions were presented in plenary sessions and will be compiled into manuscripts with which the seminar outcomes will be disseminated. As a basis of the group work, and to establish a common understanding of key concepts and terminology, the seminar included a few short, survey-style talks on a number of related topics. In particular, these talks covered:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>\"Graph data models and graph databases\" (given by Olaf Hartig),\n</li><li> \"RDF and semantics\" (by Claudio Gutierrez),\n</li><li> \"Policies and access control\" (by Sabrina Kirrane and Piero Andrea Bonatti),\n</li><li> \"Database privacy\" (by Johann-Christoph Freytag),\n</li><li> \"Distributed database systems\" (by Katja Hose), and\n</li><li>\"Federated query processing\" (by Maria-Esther Vidal).\n</li></ul> \n <p>In addition to these survey talks, every participant was given the chance to briefly highlight their research as relevant for the seminar. Moreover, in a demo session, some of the participants showcased their FSDM-related systems and tools, which gave interested attendees of this session an opportunity to play with and better understand these systems and tools. The systems and tools demonstrated in this session were the following:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> <em>Triple Pattern Fragments client</em> that runs in a browser and executes queries over a federation of Triple Pattern Fragment (TPF) interfaces (demonstrated by Joachim Van~Herwegen),\n</li><li> <em>Network of Linked Data Eddies</em> (emph{nLDE}), an efficient client-side SPARQL query engine for querying server-side data that can be accessed via a TPF interface (demonstrated by Maribel Acosta),\n</li><li> <em>Ladda</em>, a framework for delegating TPF-based query executions among multiple browsers (demonstrated by Hala Skaf-Molli),\n</li><li> <em>Quartz</em>, a system for querying replicated Triple Pattern Fragments (demonstrated by Hala Skaf-Molli),\n</li><li> <em>Ontario</em>, a federated SPARQL query engine for heterogeneous sources represented in different raw formats (demonstrated by Maria-Esther Vidal),\n</li><li> <em>UltraWrap</em>, a framework for integrating relational databases using SPARQL federation (demonstrated by Juan Sequeda),\n</li><li> <em>Ephedra</em>, a SPARQL federation engine that combines SPARQL services with other services (demonstrated by Peter Haase),\n</li><li> <em>JedAI</em>, an entity resolution toolkit (demonstrated by Themis Palpanas), and\n</li><li> <em>Exemplar Queries</em>, a framework for query answering using knowledge graphs (demonstrated by Themis Palpanas).\n</li></ul> \n <p>As mentioned before, besides the short survey talks, the demos, and the participants\u2019 presentations, the major focus of the seminar was on discussions in four working groups, where each of these groups addressed a different topic area. The remainder of this section provides a brief overview of the four topic areas covered by the groups and the respective results. More detailed summaries provided by each of the four groups can be found in a separate section of this report.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Graph Data Models.</b> Graph data models such as the RDF data model allow for a representation of both data and metadata using graphs of nodes that represent entities, and edges that model connections between entities. Graph data management encompasses techniques for managing, querying, and analyzing graph data by utilizing graph-oriented operations. SQL-like query languages have been defined for evaluating declarative queries over graph data; additionally, well-known algorithms are utilized for computing graph invariants (e.g., triangle counting or degree centrality) and for solving typical graph problems (e.g., finding shortest paths, traversals, or dense subgraphs). Furthermore, several real-world applications have been built on top of existing graph-based tools (e.g., community detection, centrality analysis, and link prediction). Graphs naturally represent a wide variety of domains (e.g., social networks, biological networks) in which data, interconnectivity, and data topology all are first-class citizens, with RDF data being one example of graph data.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the Dagstuhl seminar, a working group was formed to discuss whether tools for graph data management are sufficient to model and to manage the semantics in RDF data, taking into account that characteristics of the RDF data model (e.g., blank nodes and SPARQL operators) may affect tractability of the graph-based tasks in a federation of RDF graphs. As a first result of this discussion, the working group made the following observation. In contrast to other graph data models and query languages, the RDF data model is a  \"universal\" data model in the sense that it is designed for sharing data and knowledge in an unbounded space such as the Web. To continue the discussion, the group introduced a definition of the notion of FSDM and identified five principles that characterize FSDM: universality, unboundedness, dynamicity, network protocols, and semantics. Based on further discussion that took into account these principles, the group made two conjectures that they plan to elaborate on in a future publication and that can be summarized as follows. First, it is impossible to build a FSDM system that fully achieves universality, unboundedness, and dynamicity, all at the same time. Second, the concepts of federation and semantics are interdependent and must be tackled together to develop effective and efficient solutions for building FSDM systems.\n</p> \n <p><b>Federated Query Processing.</b> A vast number of approaches have been developed to provide a unified interface for querying federations of data sources. In the context of federations of RDF datasets, existing approaches focus on two problems: the problem of selecting the RDF datasets required to execute a federated query, and the problem of executing the resulting sub-queries efficiently against the selected data sources. Although federated query processing has been studied extensively, a number of important problems are still open, and more challenges are likely to come up as the complexity of federations increases (e.g., by increasing numbers of federation members, by replication and fragmentation of RDF data, and by federation members that update their RDF data autonomously).\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the Dagstuhl seminar, a working group was formed to discuss the problem of federated query processing over RDF data sources. Challenges imposed by the semi-structured nature of RDF, unpredictable behavior and dynamicity of Web-accessible RDF sources, and the role of the entailment regimes guided the group discussions and allowed for enumerating the main differences with the problem of federated query processing against relational databases. The group focused on the formal definition of the problem, as well as on the formalization of the subproblems of source selection, query decomposition, and query execution. As a first result, the group identified that the entailment regimes to be performed over a federation of RDF sources, as well as data replication and dynamicity, access control policies, and SPARQL query capabilities, play a crucial role in source selection, query decomposition, and query execution. State-of-the-art techniques implemented by existing approaches (e.g., FedX, ANAPSID, or Linked Data Fragments) were discussed and compared based on this formalization; the group concluded that none of existing approaches takes into account all these characteristics of RDF data sources, being required further analysis and work to empower them to solve the formalized problems. Finally, the impact of these characteristics on the performance of SPARQL operators (e.g., join, union, or optional) was discussed. The group concluded that although physical operators implemented by existing approaches are capable of adjusting query execution schedulers to RDF source availability, they are unable to adapt their execution to other RDF source characteristics, e.g., supported entailment regimes or data evolution. These issues remain open as well, and require further study from the semantic data management community. \n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Access Control and Privacy.</b> Solutions to the problem of modeling access control policies for Web resources have been benefited from Semantic Web technologies. Existing rule-based logic languages rely on ontology-based reasoning tasks to represent reactive policies for access control, and to enforce and to propagate trusted and policy-compliant interactions across resources in RDF datasets. For instance, the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a rule-based approach that allows for a description of policies to access and to exchange Web resources. Nevertheless, as per the Linked Data publishing principles, RDF properties associated with any resource can be accessed by de-referencing their corresponding URL. In applications of domains of FSDM such as personalized medicine or finances, only authorized and privacy-respecting access is allowed. Thus, novel approaches are required to bridge the gap between access-control models and unrestricted access to RDF resources.\n</p> \n <p>\nA working group with a focus on access control and privacy discussed the following open issues: a) formalisms to specify access-control and privacy policies of federation resources and to reason over the meaning of these resources; and b) techniques that enable systems to enforce privacy-aware and security-aware policies whenever a resource is accessed. After concluding that there are too many open challenges to be all solved immediately, the group agreed to focus on access control. Next, the group discussed conceptual access control models and achieved a better understanding of requirements of a conceptual framework to analyze policy-aware federated Semantic Web architectures. Finally, the group defined such a framework and made plans for a publication about it.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Use Cases and Applications.</b> In addition to the first three working groups that focused on various more technical aspects of building FSDM systems, a fourth working group looked into applications of FSDM and use cases in which adopting FSDM would be beneficial. Specifying such use cases, as well as documenting the usage of FSDM systems in existing applications, is important to better understand the requirements and the challenges of FSDM and to derive realistic testbeds for approaches to build FSDM systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nA key observation of the work group was that approaches to apply FSDM can be categorized into two classes depending on whether they focus i) on explorative, open-domain querying or ii) on controlled, close-domain querying. Then, the working group identified a broad set of general use cases of FSDM. Thereafter, the group defined a framework for developing specific use cases. This framework introduces a set of requirements for the specification of a use case. Finally, the group applied their framework to develop a number of example use cases.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Olaf Hartig, Maria-Esther Vidal, and Johann-Christoph Freytag\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Behavioural Types: Bridging Theory and Practice",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar followed the earlier Dagstuhl Seminar 17051 \"Theory and\nApplications of Behavioural Types\". Whereas Seminar 17051 was quite\nbroad, encompassing both theory and practice across a wide range of\nareas relating to behavioural types, this seminar was much more\nfocused, concentrating on how best to enable the use of behavioural\ntypes for practical programming.\n</p> \n <h3>Initial preparations</h3> \n <p>\nWe gathered initial lists of proposed talks and breakout topics prior\nto the start of the seminar via an online form. We added to these\nthroughout the week. We scheduled talks and breakout groups daily\ndepending on audience interest and participant availability. The first\npart of the week was primarily talks, with ample time for stimulating\ndiscussions; the second part included more time for breakout sessions.\n</p> \n <h3>Hybrid seminar logistics</h3> \n <p>\nDue to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the seminar was organised in hybrid format,\nwith both in-person and remote participants.\nAs the virtual participants came from a wide range of time zones\n(from central US to Japan) we gave special consideration to the time slot\n2pm-4pm CEST during which everyone could attend. Those in Europe and Japan\nwere able to attend morning sessions and those in Europe and America\nto attend further afternoon sessions (and a special evening session on\nMonday).\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to run a successful hybrid Dagstuhl seminar, we made\nessential use of the dedicated equipment available at Dagstuhl: a\nZoom-based streaming setup, with multiple cameras and ceiling\nmicrophones in the seminar room. All talks were live-streamed to both\nvirtual and in-person participants. Talks were recorded so that\nvirtual participants from incompatible time zones could catch up, then\ndeleted at the end of the week. Larger hybrid breakout sessions were\nheld in the main seminar room, and smaller ones elsewhere using a more\nad hoc setup.\n</p> \n <p>\nMoreover, all participants (local and virtual) were invited to use Zulip\n(a chat application) to exchange messages and files, pose questions during\npresentations, and remain informed on the upcoming events, group activities,\nand schedule updates.\n</p> \n <h3>Activities and outcomes</h3> \n <p>Throughout the seminar, the participants gathered in focused breakout\ngroups: the findings of the breakout groups are described in more\ndetail elsewhere in the report. Here is a brief summary:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Typing non-channel-based models</b> allowed researchers with a wide\n  range of perspectives and backgrounds to exchange their views. A key\n  observation was that modern concurrent systems that coordinate via\n  streams of events are difficult to analyse and verify with using\n  existing approaches, and new formalisms are needed.\n</li><li><b>Logic-based approaches</b> reviewed the state of the art, and\n  discussed new directions. One of the conclusions is that more\n  research is needed to relate concurrent and distributed systems to a\n  broader range of logics beyond classical and intuitionistic linear\n  logic (which are the focus of most current publications).\n</li><li><b>Type-informed recovery strategies</b> explored failure handling at\n  different levels (from network to application), and summarised\n  several open questions not addressed in existing work.\n</li><li><b>Session types with untrusted counter-parties</b> focused on how to\n  ensure that different processes interact under compatible protocols,\n  establishing the beginning of new work on monitoring and adaptation.\n</li><li><b>Join patterns / synchronisation - the next generation</b>\n  collected a survey of various attempts to integrate join patterns in\n  programming languages, and discussed why they have not yet become\n  mainstream. The discussion highlighted the need for exploring the\n  connections between join patterns and linear logic, and the use of\n  the join calculus as a reference for new implementation attempts.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe participants of several breakout groups have agreed to continue their work and collaboration after the seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to these more structured breakout sessions there\nwere further lively improvised meetings and discussions (especially\nafter dinner) which are not summarised in the report.\n</p> \n <p>\nOverall, we believe that the seminar activities were a success.\nUnfortunately the hybrid format did pose a barrier for remote\nparticipants, especially those in different time zones. But on the\npositive side, for many participants this was their first Dagstuhl\nseminar, and for the in-person participants it was their first\nin-person scientific gathering after many months of virtual events due\nto the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: their feedback has been enthusiastic.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt the end of the seminar the participants agreed to remain in contact\nto continue the discussions, and foster new collaborations. There was\nstrong enthusiasm for organising a follow-up Dagstuhl seminar in the\nfuture, perhaps taking place in about two years time. To enable future\ncollaborations the participants:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> created a GitHub organisation where all seminar participants\n  (and other researchers invited later) can exchange references and\n  materials;\n</li><li> agreed to use the seminar's Zulip chat (mentioned above) as a\n  starting point to set up a more permanent solution for continuing\n  the interactions and exchanges (e.g., a mailing list);\n</li><li> nominated four people who will propose a new seminar, building\n  upon the results of this one.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Mariangiola Dezani, Roland Kuhn, Sam Lindley, and Alceste Scalas\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Personalized Multiobjective Optimization: An Analytics Perspective",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe topic of the seminar, Personalization in Multiobjective Optimization, was motivated by ongoing changes in many areas of human activity. In particular, personalization, mass customization, and mass data have become essential in current business and engineering operations creating new challenges for academic and research communities. In the seminar, the EMO and MCDM communities, including junior and senior academic researchers as well as industry representatives, took an effort to jointly address  the ongoing changes in the real-world with multiobjective optimization.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of multiobjective optimization is to develop methods that can solve problems having a number of (conflicting) optimization criteria and constraints, providing a multitude of solution alternatives, rather than pursuing only one \"optimal\" solution. In this aim the field has been highly successful: its methods have a track record of improving decision making across a broad swath of applications, indeed wherever there are conflicting goals or objectives.  Yet, multiobjective optimization has so far focused almost exclusively on serving a single \"decision maker\", providing solutions merely as potential (not actual) alternatives. In order to fulfill  the demanding aims of mass-customization, product/service variation and personalization we see today in areas such as engineering, planning, operations, investment, media and Web services, and  healthcare, new and innovative approaches are needed. This seminar took the first steps towards this goal by bringing together leading specialists in EMO and MCDM.\n</p> \n <p>\nPersonalization in multiobjective optimization as the main theme of the seminar has focused around three <b>application challenges</b> which are highly characteristic for real-world decision making and represent  different ways that personalization is needed or delivered in an optimization setting. These were (i) Platform design and product lines, (ii) Responsive and online personalization, and (iii) Complex networks of decision makers. \nThese three application challenges were crosslinked with three <b>research domains</b> that constitute the methodological core of multiobjective optimization and have been the foundation for the discussions at the previous Dagstuhl  seminars. These were (1) Model building, (2) Preference modelling, and (3) Algorithm design and efficiency.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the seminar, we formed five multi-disciplinary working groups (WGs) to implement the crosslinking between these application challenges and research domains, see Table 1. Each working group was focused on an application challenge (a row in Table 1; WGs 2, 3 and 4) or a research domain (a column in Table 1; WGs 1 and 5), all taking specific perspectives on the respective topics. \n</p> \n <p>The program was updated on a daily basis to maintain flexibility\nin balancing time slots for talks, discussions, and working groups. The working groups were established on the first day in an open and highly interactive discussion. The program included several opportunities to report back from the working groups in order to establish further links and allow for adaptations and feedback.  Some of the working groups split into subgroups and rejoined later in order to focus more strongly on different aspects of the topics considered. \nAbstracts of the talks and extended abstracts of the working groups can be found in subsequent chapters of this report.\nFurther notable events during the week included: (i) a hike on Wednesday afternoon with some sunshine (despite the quite terrible weather during the rest of the week), (ii) an announcements session allowing us to share details of upcoming events in our research community, and (iii) a wine and cheese party made possible by the support of the ITWM Kaiserslautern, represented by Karl-Heinz K\u00fcfer.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>\nFourteen topical presentations were complemented by discussions in five working groups, covering the main themes of the seminar. The outcomes of each of the working groups can be seen in the sequel. Extended versions of their findings will be submitted to a Special Issue on \"Personalization in Multiobjective Optimization: An Analytics Perspective\"  of the <em>Journal of Multicriteria Decision Analysis</em>, edited by Theo Stewart, that is guest edited by the organizers of this seminar. The submission deadline is July 31, 2018, and several working groups plan to submit extended versions of their reports to this special issue.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was highly productive, very lively and full of discussions, and has thus further strengthened the interaction between the EMO and MCDM communities. We expect that the seminar will initiate a new research domain interrelating multiobjective optimization and personalization, as it similarly has happened after the previous seminars in this series. \n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgment</h3> \n <p>A huge thank you to the Dagstuhl office and its very helpful and patient staff; many thanks to the organizers of the previous seminars in the series for the initiative and continuing advice; and many thanks to all the participants, who contributed in so many different ways to make this week a success. In the appendix, we also give special thanks to Joshua Knowles as he steps down from the organizer role.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Kathrin Klamroth, Joshua D.

            "title": "Decision-Making Modeling and Solutions for Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Industry 4.0 vision is a frequently discussed topic in manufacturing enterprises in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is expected that advanced technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data technologies enable the emergence of smart manufacturing systems. A smart factory promises to bring transparency to manufacturing facilities by integrating\ntechnological advances in computer networks, data integration, and analytics [13]. At the same time, critical questions are asked related to the benefits of Industry 4.0 ([14], [17], [15]). It is mainly criticized that the requirements and consequences of Industry 4.0 regarding future production planning and control strategies are not fully understood or not even taken into account in the overall Industry 4.0 conception, i.e., many of key decision processes are not included [14].\n</p> \n <p>\nThe semiconductor industry is capital intensive with the cost of an entire wafer fab up to nearly $10 billion US. The high cost is primarily due to extremely expensive machines, some cost up to $100 million US each. The manufacturing process is very complex due to reentrant flows in combination with very long cycle times and multiple sources of uncertainty [16]. Capacity expansions are expensive and time-consuming. The semiconductor industry is an extreme field for production planning and control solutions from an algorithmic and also from a software and information systems point of view. At the same time, the degree of\nautomation has always been and continues to be high compared to other industries [1]. On the one hand, one can argue that some elements of smart manufacturing are already realized in wafer fabs, namely:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>most manufacturing information is available in real-time\n</li><li>\tthe manufacturing process is paperless\n</li><li>lots can be uniquely identified and located\n</li><li>\tcollaborative human-machine interactions exist.\n</li></ul> \n <p>On the other hand, there are significant differences from automation efforts in manual work-intensive industries such as automotive or aircraft manufacturing where assembly operations are performed in flow lines. In addition to shop-floor control concerns, supply chain management (SCM) problems have become more and more important in the last decade in the semiconductor industry which necessitate horizontal integration of the semiconductor supply chain.\n</p> \n <p>The literature with respect to an adoption of Industry 4.0 principles for semiconductor manufacturing is small and mainly on a survey or conceptual level ([6], [4], [9], [3], [10, 11]). Concrete answers towards future production planning and control strategies that exploit the new possibilities of CPSs and big data approaches to address complicated decisions involved in semiconductor supply chains are only very initially given in the literature.\n</p> \n <p>The major objective of the proposed seminar was related to developing a research agenda for making smart semiconductor manufacturing decisions and the information systems to empower flexible decisions for smart production. This includes innovative modeling approaches for supply chain planning and more detailed production planning and scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing and an analysis of requirements for next-generation information systems that support such decisions. One of the expected outcomes of the seminar consisted\nof developing a significant draft of a concept for a simulation testbed which allows for assessing smart planning and control decisions in the semiconductor industry.\n</p> \n <p>\nThus, the purpose of this workshop was to bring together researchers from different disciplines including information systems, computer science, industrial engineering, supply chain management, and operations research whose central interest is in decision-making for smart semiconductor manufacturing. Practitioners from the semiconductor industry who have frequently articulated their perception that academic research does not always address the real problems faced by the industry brought in their domain knowledge to make\nsure that progress towards applicability and feasibility would be made during the seminar. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, the seminar had only nine attendees from Germany who physically attended at Dagstuhl (see Section Participants). Moreover, four online talks were given by participants from US, Taiwan, and Germany. We had participants from the leading semiconductor companies Infineon Technologies and Globalfoundries.\n</p> \n <p>\nA primary purpose of the workshop was to extend the scope of the academic research community from conventional decision-making for single wafer fabs to making smart semiconductor manufacturing decisions for entire semiconductor supply chains. The principle architecture of the planning and control system of a conventional semiconductor supply chain is shown in Figure 1.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4680/Grafik1.png\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <caption><b>Figure 1</b> Planning and Control System of a Semiconductor Supply Chain (adapted from [16]).</caption> \n <h3>Seminar Objectives</h3> \n <p>The primary objective of the proposed seminar was to develop a research agenda for decisionmaking in smart semiconductor manufacturing. This included innovative modeling approaches for supply chain planning and detailed production planning and scheduling/dispatching in semiconductor supply chains. But it also included ideas on how to design the related future information systems.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe research agenda was developed around the following two main topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Topic 1: Novel decision-making approaches that exploit the huge amount of available data and orchestrate the interrelated decisions:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>It is required to develop a better understanding of which parts of the Industry 4.0 vision are already implemented in semiconductor manufacturing and what is still missing.\n</li><li>The specific automation drivers in semiconductor manufacturing compared to other industries must be identified.\n</li><li>The usage of additional data which, for instance, is provided by sensors and cyberphysical systems has to be explored to make better decisions [2]. The improvement potential based on the advanced data availability must be quantified [10].\n</li><li>Research is necessary to determine which decisions can or even should be integrated. Possible examples for integrated short-term decisions are job scheduling on machines and automated transportation and job scheduling and preventative maintenance planning. Integrated scheduling and process control decisions are another example. On the mid-term planning level, the integrated management of production jobs and engineering jobs is challenging. Up to 30% of all jobs in a wafer fab are engineering jobs. They compete with the production jobs for the scarce capacity of the machines. It is also interesting to make integrated production planning and inventory planning decisions in semiconductor manufacturing.\n</li><li>We are interested in which changes are required (or even possible) for planning and control algorithms in smart manufacturing systems. It has to be discussed whether we expect fundamentally new algorithms or not.\n</li><li>We are also interested in exploring the need for new fab layouts in the context of smart manufacturing. Initial steps towards the possible redesign of the automated material handling system (AMHS) are discussed by Ham and Kim [7] and Hwang and Jang [8].\n</li><li>Dynamics and stochasticity have to be included into decision-making. Different modeling techniques that attempt to reduce the effects of stochasticity include robust optimization, approximate dynamic programming, and stochastic programming and these techniques need to be researched in the smart semiconductor manufacturing context. Different approaches to appropriately deal with stochasticity include rolling planning techniques and inventory holding strategies and these also need to be studied. Generation of scenarios and other distribution parameters for planning problems in supply chains using big data techniques have to be investigated.\n</li><li>Many planning and control approaches are based on (distributed) hierarchical approaches. The role of anticipation of lower level behavior in upper level decision-making is still not well understood and has to be studied in more detail. Because many different, often autonomous decision-making entities including humans occur in semiconductor manufacturing, negotiation approaches are typical in such distributed hierarchical planning and control systems. Research is needed to investigate how such negotiation approaches can be automated and which decisions should continue to be made by humans.\n</li><li>It has to be explored how to incorporate sustainability issues into decision making. For instance, taking advantage of real-time pricing in future energy markets is only reasonable when scheduling decisions can be made in real-time.\n</li><li>The relationship of real-time decisions based on real-time information on the status of the shop-floor (or even the supply chain) and planning nervousness has to be studied.\n</li><li>As the level of automation increases in the factory of the future, there is a need to adapt the decision-making entities to the current situation on the shop floor and at the entire supply chain level. Different machine learning paradigms have to be investigated for this purpose.\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Topic 2: Future information systems for decision support and facilitating digital transformation:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>The required changes for next-generation decision support systems have to be investigated.\nIt is expected that decentralized decision support systems are more important\nthan in the past.\n</li><li>Alternative software solutions including software agents and service-oriented computing for planning and scheduling applications in smart semiconductor manufacturing have to be proposed.\n</li><li>Alternative software solutions including software agents and service-oriented computing for planning and scheduling applications in smart semiconductor manufacturing have to be proposed.\n</li><li>We have to study role of different simulation paradigms in the factory of the future/supply chain of the future.\n</li><li>The benefit of digital twins in semiconductor manufacturing has to be explored. For instance, it has to be decided at what levels (e.g. factory, supply chain) they should be considered.\n</li><li>Integration concepts for state-of-the-art computing techniques to get models that are computationally tractable and address the different uncertainties encountered in this industry have to be investigated for their usage in smart semiconductor manufacturing.\n</li><li>Getting a better understanding the interaction of human agents with information systems in the factory of the future is required.\n</li><li>Because of the complexity of semiconductor supply chains, long computing times still hinder the usage of analytic solution approaches especially for what-if analysis. The role of state-of-the-art computing techniques including parallel computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) machines or cloud computing techniques in decision-making for smart semiconductor manufacturing needs to be investigated.\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul> \n <p>Since the expected potential of smart manufacturing is based on advanced information and communication technologies, we think that the second topic is important and should be also addressed in the research agenda. Research related only to the first main topic is not sufficient.\n</p> \n <p>Due to the inherent complexity of semiconductor supply chains, simulation of the physical supply chain is required to: a) understand the interactions between the planning and control components and the physical supply chain, b) find solution approaches to problems, and c) verify the solution approaches in the risk-free simulation environment before implementing them. Existing models do not reflect the complexity and the level of detail of current and future semiconductor supply chains. Therefore, the secondary objective of the seminar\nconsisted in identifying the core elements of a simulation testbed which allows for assessing smart planning and control decisions in the semiconductor industry.\n</p> \n <h3>The Process</h3> \n <p>In the opening session, the organizers welcomed the participants. Next, the participants each introduced themselves. This was followed by an overview of the goals and objectives of the seminar and a detailed review of the seminar program including the ground rules for interactions.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe remainder of the day on Monday consisted of a keynote talk by Chen-Fu Chien\nand two industry overview talks (by Hans Ehm and by Steffen Kalisch). Another keynote talk was given by Leon McGinnis on Monday afternoon. The rest of Monday afternoon, Tuesday, and half a day on Wednesday were devoted to presentations and discussions about the various elements of smart decision-making in semiconductor supply chain planning and control systems as shown in Figure 1 above. There was another keynote talk delived by John Fowler on simulation modeling to reduce the impact of COVID-19. See Table 1 below for a\nlist of topics and presenters and Section 3 for abstracts of the presentations.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4681/20452-table-1.png\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <caption><b>Table 1</b> Individual Presentations.</caption> \n <p>\nTuesday afternoon was devoted to one breakout session with report outs on the topics in Table \nef{Table2}. Section \nef{breakout} has the breakout report outs. The first set of breakout sessions had two groups focus on smart planning and control decisions. The second set of breakouts on Wednesday morning again had two groups that discuss requirements for performance assessment of smart planning and control decisions in semiconductor supply chains.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4682/20452-table-2.png\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <caption><b>Table 2</b> Breakout Sessions.</caption> \n <p>Thursday consisted of a discussion on the required core elements of a simulation testbed for assessing smart semiconductor and supply chain planning and control decisions and a wrap-up session.\n</p> \n <h3>Key Take Aways</h3> \n <p>There were a number of key findings and areas for future research that were identified in the seminar. We will first summarize some of the key findings and will follow this with some areas for future research. \n</p> \n <p>One of the first findings was that the participants generally agreed that the term smart manufacturing is  somehow fuzzy. While the different elements in Figure 1 are reasonably well understood by both the industrial and academic communities with respect to smart decision-making, the interactions between the elements are less well understood. Second, the participants generally agree that the integration of the decisions made by the different elements is often fairly ad hoc and could/should be improved. Finally, the participants\ngenerally agreed that there are new requirements for an adequate reference model for smart manufacturing in semiconductor supply chains. Although there are reasonable data sets available on the factory (i.e., the SMT2020 dataset, cf. [12]) and supply chain level (cf. [5]) no data sets exist yet that take the specifics of smart manufacturing into account.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to the findings mentioned above, several areas for future research were identified. An overarching idea was that the future research should focus more on using artificial intelligence tools in smart manufacturing for semiconductor supply chains. Some of the future research areas are included below:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Using ontologies, for instance the digital reference, for planning and control purposes.\n</li><li>Developing better integration of various smart decisions made in the elements of Figure 1.\n</li><li>Incorporating sustainability aspects into wafer fab and supply chain models.\n</li><li>Extend existing performance assessment schemes for smart manufacturing, for instance\nby considering renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind.\n</li><li>Extend existing simulation-based performance assessment schemes in the sense that machine learning-based planning and control schemes can be benchmarked. This requires adaptive behavior of the planning and control schemes.\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Next Steps</h3> \n <p>\nThe organizers plan to repeat the seminar after the end of the Covid 19 pandemic since several objectives of the seminar were not reached due to the limited number of participating attendees. This is especially true for the development of the research agenda for smart decisions in semiconductor manufacturing and for the simulation testbed which allows for assessing smart planning and control decisions in the semiconductor industry.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgements</h3> \n <p>The seminar organizers would like to thank the Dagstuhl team for the provided support and the flexibility which was required due to the Covid 19 situation. The seminar also would not have been nearly as productive without the active contribution of every physical or virtual attendee, and for that the organizers are extremely grateful. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Chien, C.-F., Dauz\u00e9re-P\u00e8r\u00e9s, S., Ehm, H., Fowler, J.

            "title": "Mobile Data Visualization",
            "data": "\n <p>\nAs pen- and/or touch-enabled mobile devices have become more powerful and ubiquitous, we see a growing demand for mobile data visualization to facilitate visual access to data on mobile devices (see Figure 1 for examples). Lay people increasingly access a wide range of data, including weather, finance, and personal health on their phone. Small business owners start to use business intelligence software equipped with data visualization on mobile\ndevices to make better business decisions. In responding to these needs, practitioners have actively been designing mobile visualizations embedded in commercial systems. However, research communities, such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Visualization\n(InfoVis), and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) have not paid enough attention to mobile data visualization.\n</p> \n <p>\nOver the past few decades, the visualization research community has conducted extensive research, designing and developing a large number of visualization techniques and systems mostly for a desktop environment. However, the accumulated knowledge may not be readily transferable to mobile devices due to their fundamental differences in their display size, interaction, and target audience, among others. The small display on mobile devices is more\nvulnerable to the scalability issue and poses a well-known challenge, the fat finger problem. Mouse-over interaction, which is prevalent in interactive visualization systems in the desktop environment, is not available on mobile devices. While traditional visualizations mainly target data-savvy groups of people such as scientists and researchers, visualizations on mobile\ndevices should account for a broader range of target audience, including lay people who might have low data and visualization literacy.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4303/mobilevis.png\" width=\"50%\"/> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar follows in the footsteps of the ``Data Visualization on Mobile Devices'' workshop at CHI 2018, our initial effort in establishing a community around mobile data visualization. \nWe brought researchers and practitioners from relevant application and research fields, including InfoVis, UbiComp, mobile HCI, and interaction design to exchange information and experiences, to stimulate discussion, to make new connections, and to identify novel ideas and future directions around mobile data visualization. \n</p> \n <p>\nUnlike the CHI workshop, this five-day Dagstuhl workshop enabled us to explore mobile data visualization in depth through speedy &amp; intense research exchanges, interactive demos &amp; tutorials, as well as active breakout group discussions.\n</p> \n <h3>The Week at a Glance</h3> \n <p><b>Monday.</b> The seminar was kicked off by the organizers with an introduction to the topic of mobile data visualization and by providing organizational information. Afterwards, all participants introduced themselves and their expectations with a short two-minute slide presentation. \nThis session was followed by a speedy research brainstorming activity (see Figure 2): In rapid five-minute sessions, two participants facing each other introduced their research activities and jointly sketched new ideas. By rotating half of the group, each session was repeated eleven times with new constellations of two people each time.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4304/ResearchStorming.JPG\" width=\"50%\"/> \n <p>In the afternoon, five demo stations were set up and participants were split into groups to attend them in turn. Five researchers presented their latest mobile visualization demos in hands-on sessions (see Figure). These were:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> Tanja Blascheck: Smartwatch demo from a study comparing three representations--bar, donut, text (joint work with Lonni Besan\u00e7on, Anastasia Bezerianos, Bongshin Lee, Petra Isenberg).\n</li><li> Matthew Bremer: Tilting, brushing, &amp; dialing for mobile vis (joint work with Bongshin Lee, Christopher Collins, Ken Hinckley).\n</li><li> Tobias Isenberg: Personal home automation system with mobile data access and control.\n</li><li> Alark Joshi: Visualization of off-screen data using summarization techniques (joint work with Martino Kuan, Alejandro Garcia, Sophie Engle).\n</li><li> Jo Vermeulen: Product Fingerprints, a mobile visualization that allows people to compare nutritional information between food products (joint work with Carrie Mah, Kevin Ta, Samuel Huron, Richard Pusch, Jo Vermeulen, Lora Oehlberg, Sheelagh Carpendale).\n</li></ul> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4305/DemoHour.JPG\" width=\"50%\"/> \n <p>\nIn a second activity, 14 participants presented a design critique of an existing mobile visualization, partly commercial products, partly research results (see Figure 4). Besides evoking the spirit of a good discussion, it helped getting a broad overview about currently available solutions.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4306/Critique.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/> \n <p>\nIn a followup activity, to arrive at a common understanding of the state of the art in mobile data visualization, we split attendees into three groups according to their main expertise. The three groups were:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Information Visualization--Mobile Visualization Resources\n</li><li> Visualization in Ubiquitous Computing Research\n</li><li> Mobile Interaction and Human Computer Interaction\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nEach group was tasked to collect and discuss the state of the art, with an end goal of creating a short presentation to be given to the entire audience. As a result, the collected material and insights were presented to the plenum by each group.\n</p> \n <p>\nThrough these diverse activities during the first day, participants did not only gain a good understanding of each other's background and research interests, but also established a common ground and expertise in the field of mobile data visualization\n</p> \n <p><b>Tuesday.</b> The second day started with a lively brainstorming and discussion of challenges and important research questions in the field of mobile data visualization. From about ten larger topics we identified, four were chosen to form parallel breakout groups: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Group 1: Evaluating Mobile Data Visualization\n</li><li> Group 2: What is Mobile Vis?\n</li><li> Group 3: Responsive Visualization\n</li><li> Group 4: Vis for Good &amp; Ethics\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nUsing the impressive facilities of Dagstuhl in terms of rooms and places, space to think and coffee to drink, we had intense discussions within each group. We generated deeper research questions and challenges, and identified collaborative cross-disciplinary research opportunities and approaches. Section 4 provides more details on each of these working groups.\n</p> \n <p>\nAfter lunch, groups reported back on what they had discussed (see Figure 5). \nThe four groups decided to continue and deepen their discussions in the afternoon, this time focusing more on what could become a concrete research output.\n</p> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0004/4307/Group2-Reportback.JPG\" width=\"50%\"/> \n <p><b>Wednesday.</b> Wednesday morning was devoted to the presentation of tutorials. Five participants had volunteered to give tutorials in two time slots, allowing other participants to attend two one-hour tutorials. Figure 6 shows the title slides of all informative and well-received tutorials, and Section 3 provides details on each of them.\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing the tradition of Dagstuhl Seminar, Wednesday afternoon was set aside for social activities. We took the bus to experience the famous Saarschleife high from the impressive treetop walk. Visiting Mettlach and having dinner in a brewery intensified personal conversations and fostered planning for joint research collaborations.\n</p> \n <p><b>Thursday.</b> Similar to Tuesday, the entire day was dedicated to group work (see Figure 7). The list of possible topics for breakout groups was revisited, and people assembled to form new groups on other challenging topics:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Group 5: Starting Mobile Visualization from Scratch\n</li><li> Group 6: Beyond Watch &amp; Phone: From Mobile to Ubiquitous Visualization\n</li><li> Group 7: (Discoverable) Interaction for Mobile Visualization\n</li><li> Group 8: From Perception to Behavior Change: Designing and Evaluating Glanceable Mobile Vis\n</li><li> Group 9: Mobile Vis for 3D Data / AR Vis\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAgain, both the morning and afternoon were used for intensely discussing challenges, defining design spaces, shaping the knowledge on the given topic, and identifying opportunities for joint research. Groups also reported back to the plenum, and results were discussed openly. Section 4 provides more details on each of these working groups and their outcomes.\n</p> \n <p><b>Friday.</b> After interesting and enriching days of joint discussions, which considerably broadened the horizon, time had come to wrap up the seminar on Mobile Data Visualization. Most importantly, a broad range of future collaborative activities were discussed: writing a state-of-the-art report, joint grant proposals, further workshop proposals, individual papers, editing a special journal issue, and writing a book on the topic. In the end, we agreed on a book as a possible major outcome (see Section 5). Organizational details were clarified, before the seminar was concluded with thanking all participants for their great contributions and commitment during the entire week.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                    Eun Kyoung Choe, Raimund Dachselt, Petra Isenberg, and Bongshin Lee\n                </img></div> \n",

            "title": "Biggest Failures in Security",
            "data": "\n <h3>General Introduction</h3> \n <p>\nIn the present era of ubiquitous digitalization, security is a concern for everyone. Consequently, it evolved as one of the most important  fields in computer science. \n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, one may get the impression that the situation is hopeless. Nearly on a daily basis, reports of new security problems and cyberattacks are published. \nThus, one has to admit that despite the huge efforts continuously invested since many decades, securing IT systems remains an open challenge for community and industry. \n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the main reasons is that the variety and complexity of IT systems keeps increasing, making it practically impossible for security experts to grasp the full system. This results into the development of independent and isolated security solutions that at best can close some specific security holes. \nSumming up, security requires to solve an increasing number of inter- and intradisciplinary challenges while current approaches are not sufficiently effective. The aim of this seminar was to gain an interdisciplinary view on security and to identify new strategies for comprehensively securing IT systems.\n</p> \n <h3>Goals</h3> \n <p>\nThe goals of the seminar was to address the following main challenges and to commonly discuss solution strategies:\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Challenge 1: Interdisciplinarity</b> The topic of security is getting more and more complex and already understanding the state-of-the-art within one discipline is highly challenging. This makes it practically impossible to understand the problems and constraints from other disciplines. Moreover, different disciplines often have their own methods and \"culture\". From our experience, working with colleagues from other disciplines requires at the beginning an enormous effort to understand each other. The complexity grows even further when more than two disciplines are involved.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Challenge 2: Variety of Problems</b> In each discipline, a variety of problems do exist. Naturally, researchers have to single out specific problems that they work on instead of aiming for comprehensive solutions. The selection of problems usually depends on several factors, e.g., background of the researcher, topicality of the subject, etc. Most often, researchers aim for solving very specific problems rather than coming up with more comprehensive solutions. Moreover, the selection is driven by interdisciplinary factors. \n</p> \n <p> \nFor sure, interdisciplinary research does exist already. However, it is mostly restricted to address very few disciplines and has been rather bottom-up by focusing on very specific problems. \nInstead, the scope of the seminar was to aim for a <em>broad top-down approach</em>. To this end, the focus was on the following questions:\n</p> <ul>\n<li> What are the main recurring reasons within disciplines why security solutions fail, i.e., the biggest failures? (Top View)\n</li><li>How do these failures impact solutions developed in other sub-disciplines? (Broad View)\n</li><li>What are possible strategies to solve these problems?\n</li></ul> \n <h3>Sturcture</h3> \n <p>\nThe seminar was structured accordingly. Before the seminar, a survey was conducted where the participants have been asked, what they consider to be biggest failures in security. The list of participants was composed of experts from  different, selected sub-fields who were encouraged to explain the main challenges in their field to the audience. Here, ample opportunities for discussions have been provided. That is, instead of having many different talks back-to-back, we had several overview talks from different fields within the first few days. Afterwards, the whole audience commonly  identified three topics to be further investigated in separate working groups:\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> The process and role of certifications\n</li><li> The human factor in security\n</li><li>The education of the society in security \n</li></ol> \n <p>\nThese subgroups met in parallel and worked on specific questions. The remaining days were composed of workgroup meetings and individual talks. At the end of the seminar, the workgroups reported to the whole audience their findings. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis report summarizes the finding of the survey (Section 3), the topics of the individual talks (Section 4), and also the findings of the individual workgroups (Section 5).</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Frederik Armknecht, Ingrid Verbauwhede, Melanie Volkamer, and Moti Yung\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Multidisciplinary Approaches to Multivalued Data: Modeling, Visualization, Analysis",
            "data": "\n <h3>Topics and Motivation</h3> \n <p>\nThis seminar is the sixth in a series of Dagstuhl Seminars devoted to the use of tensor fields and other higher order descriptors, including higher-order tensors or Spherical Harmonics, to model intricate multivalued data that arises in modern medical imaging modalities, as well as in simulations in engineering and industry. Even though the literature on image analysis, visualization, as well as statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning is quite rich for scalar or vector-valued data, relatively little work has been performed on these disciplines for tensors and higher-order descriptors.\n</p> \n <p>\nApplications wherein such descriptors can be employed to process multivalued data range from neuroimaging to image analysis and engineering. Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI), an MRI modality which makes it possible to visualize and quantify structural information about white matter pathways in the brain <em>in vivo,</em> is one of the driving technologies, but tensors have also shown their usefulness as feature descriptors for segmentation and grouping in image analysis, including structure tensors and tensor voting. Applications in solid mechanics, civil engineering, computational fluid dynamics and geology require the processing of tensor fields as part of domain-specific modeling, simulation, and analysis (e.g. stress-strain relationships, inertia tensors, permittivity tensor).\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl seminar provides a unique platform by facilitating scientific exchange between key researchers in seemingly diverse applications. Despite these disciplines' commonalities in terms of the tools employed, it would be very unlikely that these scientists would attend the same conference as the theme of most conferences is defined by a specific application. By bringing together specialists in visualization, image processing, statistics, and numerical mathematics, the Dagstuhl seminar provides new impulses for methodological work in those areas.\n</p> \n <h3>Organization of the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nTo ensure a steady inflow of new ideas and challenges, we put an emphasis on inviting researchers who previously did not have the opportunity to attend one of the meetings in this series. This was true for almost half the attendees in the final list of participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar itself started with a round of introductions, in which all participants presented their area of work within 100 seconds with help of a single slide. This helped to create a basis for discussion early on during the week, and was particularly useful since participants came from different scientific communities, backgrounds, and countries.\n</p> \n <p>\nA substantial part of the week was devoted to presentations by 26 participants, who spent 20 minutes each on presenting recent advances, ongoing work, or open challenges, followed by ten minutes of discussion in the plenary, as well as in-depth discussions in the breaks and over lunch. Abstracts of the presentations are collected in this report. For the traditional social event on Wednesday, we went on a hike, which was joined by almost all participants, and offered additional welcome opportunities for interaction.\n</p> \n <p>\nThree breakout sessions were organized in the afternoons, and another one in the evening, so that none of them took place in parallel, and everyone had the opportunity to visit all groups relevant to him or her. The topics of the four groups were formed by clustering topics brought up in the round of introductions, and were denoted as:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Visual encodings and the interface between theory and  applications\n</li><li> Models and geometry\n</li><li> Topological methods\n</li><li> Multi-field and tensor group analysis\n</li></ul> \n <p>Depending on the interests of the participants, the breakout groups differed in nature, ranging from the collection of open questions and discussions on future directions of the field to spontaneous tutorial-style presentations. Notes taken during these sessions, and the main results of two of them are summarized in this report.\n</p> \n <h3>Outcomes</h3> \n <p>The participants all agreed that the meeting was successful and stimulating, and we plan to publish another Springer book documenting the results of the meeting. Participants have pre-registered thirteen chapters already during the seminar, and we are in the process of collecting additional contributions both from participants and from researchers working on closely related topics who could not attend the meeting. We expect that the book will be ready for publication in 2017.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt was voted that the group will apply for another meeting in this series. In addition to the current organizers Thomas Schultz (University of Bonn, Germany) and Evren \u00d6zarslan (Link\u00f6pings Universitet, Sweden), Andrea Fuster (TU Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and Eugene Zhang (Oregon State University, USA) agreed to help apply for the next event.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgments</h3> \n <p>The organizers thank all the attendees for their contributions and extend special thanks to the team of Schloss Dagstuhl for helping to make this seminar a success. As always, we enjoyed the warm atmosphere, which supports formal presentations as well as informal exchange of ideas.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ingrid Hotz, Evren \u00d6zarslan, and Thomas Schultz\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Integration of Expert Knowledge for Interpretable Models in Biomedical Data Analysis",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe participants were drawn from three distinct disciplines: Biomedical Research, Machine Learning and Visualizations. On the first day, three overview talks on different aspects of bio-medical research were presented, including an overview of omics and clinical data and databases, a summary of current problems in cancer prognosis and metastasis, and steroid metabolomics and its relevance to disease. On the next two days, there were four overview talks on computer science topics, including machine learning, modeling and visualization.  Participants also had the opportunity to give shorter presentations of their current research areas and describe open problems, as well as introduce new and relevant datasets and methods.  In total, 16 such short talks were presented, covering various areas of biomedical research and computer science.  All talks served as starting points for extensive plenary and individual evening and after dinner discussions about the integration of expert knowledge into data analysis and modeling, specifically targeted to cancer informatics. From these discussions, it was clear that there was an urgent need for interactive collaboration to foster successful analysis and interpretation of biomedical data and the success of such collaboration would hinge on active participation from domain experts from biomedical research, data mining and visualization. \n</p> \n <p>\nMotivated by this conclusion, we identified a joint project in cancer genomics, which would exploit the expertise represented by the seminar participants. On the fourth day, participants discussed the interactive methodology we will follow in the project. Following this, first results obtained by analysis of cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was presented in a joint talk by representatives from all three disciplines (biology, machine learning, visualization).  We will extend this project further in the coming months with active participation from the clinicians and computer scientists. The goal of this effort is not just to solve a relevant and outstanding problem in cancer biology but also to work towards publication of our findings in a high-impact journal authored by all participants. To foster this project, we will establish a Wiki, which will serve as a platform for collaboration and communication. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe participants gave feedback on Friday on the organization and content of the seminar. All participants were appreciative of the open, friendly and constructive atmosphere that made learning and insight possible for experts from very diverse disciplines. Getting to know the basic methods used in each field was seen as the perfect starting point for future collaborations.  The idea of a joined wiki page as a collaboration platform as well as the already started joined project were highlighted as especially important. Follow-up-meetings of newly formed interdisciplinary teams were initiated and planned e.g. one in Copenhagen. The participants were very enthusiastic about having a further meeting after about a year to discuss results and new directions resulting from the joint project initiated here. Apart from working on a specific project in cancer biology, the goal of the collaboration is to establish a methodology for interactions, disseminate ideas and protocols among the disciplines and establish a common language to foster understanding.   \n</p> \n <p>\nIn summary, biologists, both medical and computational experts in the seminar are enthusiastic about joining forces to solve outstanding problems in understanding biological processes.  Many of the machine learning methods presented by participants are ready to be applied in real environments such as in clinical use or in research laboratories, after proper technology transfer. Such technology transfer requires targeted funding and agreed upon protocols to ensure adequate resources and necessary quality control, for subsequent release to the community.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe participants felt that influential members in each community should seek opportunities and avenues to urge the appropriate agencies (NIH, NFS, EU Scientific bodies) to establish a targeted program for technology transfer of computational solutions to challenges in the interpretation of biomedical data. Such a program would solicit competitive funding proposals from groups consisting of both biomedical and computational experts, and require products that are rigorously demonstrated on real problems, as well as satisfy appropriate coding and user interface standards, and where appropriate, satisfy requirements of interfacing or integration with existing established systems currently in use by the community.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn medicine the data is treasure <br/>\nWhose value's beyond any measure <br/>\nBut it is not surprising <br/>\nThat without analysing <br/>\nAcquisition is meaningless pleasure<br/>\n(Michael Biehl and Gyan Bhanot)</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gyan Bhanot, Michael Biehl, Thomas Villmann, and Dietlind Z\u00fchlke\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Algorithms and Complexity in Phylogenetics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nDisentangling the evolutionary relationships between species dates back at least to Charles Darwin and his voyage on board the Beagle. Ever since, the research area of phylogenetics focusses on the reconstruction and analysis of rooted leaf-labeled trees, called phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees, to unravel ancestral relationships between entities like species, languages, and viruses. However, processes such as horizontal gene transfer and hybridization challenge the model of a phylogenetic tree since they result in mosaic patterns of relationships that cannot be represented by a single tree. Indeed, it is now widely acknowledged that rooted leaf-labeled digraphs with underlying cycles, called phylogenetic networks, are better suited to represent evolutionary histories.\n</p> \n <p>\nBiological questions and applications motivate much of the research in phylogenetics. Nevertheless, most of the software that is routinely used by evolutionary biologists has its roots in theoretical research areas which include algorithms, computational complexity, graph theory, algebra, and probability theory. With a shift from phylogenetic trees towards more complex graphs, the development of new algorithms for phylogenetic networks is currently an active area of research that requires deep insight from computer science and mathematics.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe objective of the seminar was to facilitate interactions between the two research communities of (i) computational and mathematical phylogenetics and (ii) theoretical computer science with a focus on algorithms and complexity. Specifically, its goal was to advance the development of novel algorithms (with provable performance guarantee) to reconstruct and analyze phylogenetic networks that are grounded in techniques from theoretical computer science such as parameterized and approximation algorithms.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis four-day seminar brought together 27 researchers from ten countries, whose research spans theoretical computer science and algorithms, (discrete) mathematics, and computational and mathematical phylogenetics. The seminar program included six overview talks, nine research talks (one of which via Skype), a rump session for short five-minute contributions, and slots for discussions and group work on open problems. More specifically, the overview talks provided introductions to techniques and current trends in parameterized algorithms, combinatorial decompositions, and enumeration algorithms on one hand, and introductions to spaces of phylogenetic trees and networks, and  the reconstruction of networks from smaller networks and trees on the other hand. Additionally, each overview talk included open questions and challenges that provided a foundation for discussions and group work throughout the week. \nThe research  talks, of which three were given by postgraduate students, covered topical streams of research, including phylogenetic split theory, the placement of phylogenetic problems in higher classes of the polynomial hierarchy, new insight into the popular so-called Tree Containment problem, and phylogenetic diversity and biodiversity indices.  Moreover, five working groups were formed on the second day of the seminar. While  the research projects that were initiated in these groups are  ongoing, some groups obtained first results during the seminar that were presented on the last day. \n</p> \n <p>\nBy building on initially existing synergies between the two research communities, the seminar has taken a leap towards developing new and fostering existing collaborations between both communities. Collaborative work was encouraged and put into practice over formal and informal discussions as well as three group work sessions. Since a significant number of open problems in phylogenetics require the combined expertise of experts in phylogenetics and theoretical computer science, we expect the collaborations formed at Schloss Dagstuhl to make progress on problems across the traditional discipline boundaries and, ideally, lead to joint peer-reviewed journal or conference publications.\n </p> \n <p>\nTo conclude, this seminar has acknowledged that exchange and connection between the two research communities of theoretical computer science and phylogenetics is fruitful for both sides. Techniques and methods from algorithms and complexity as well as theoretical considerations in general enable, account for, and foster new insights in problems from phylogenetics. Conversely, the specific features and problem structures appearing in the context of phylogenetic trees and networks provide novel theoretical challenges and new directions for foundational research in algorithms and computational complexity.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe thank all participants for their contributions and for openly sharing their ideas and research questions that led to a positive working atmosphere and many discussions throughout the seminar. Furthermore, we sincerely thank the team of Schloss Dagstuhl for their excellent support and communication as well as for providing an enjoyable seminar environment.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Magnus Bordewich, Britta Dorn, Simone Linz, and Rolf Niedermeier\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "On-Body Interaction: Embodied Cognition Meets Sensor/Actuator Engineering to Design New Interfaces",
            "data": "\n <p>\nFor the past 40 years, input to computers has been given with mouse and keyboard. Over the last decade, multi-touch has become popular for small devices (e.g., phones and tablets) as well as for large displays (e.g., interactive tabletops and wall-sized screens). All these forms of input require the user to hold or touch a device. Conversely, output has happened on large screens external to the body (e.g., a desktop) or small ones on the body (e.g., smartwatches). The field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has worked to understand these user interfaces (UIs) and how people use them, in addition to establishing principles of design and models of performance to help design them so that they are useful and usable.\n</p> \n <p>\nRecently, however, HCI researchers have been interested in allowing new forms of on-body technologies. One vision is to integrate technology with the body so as to use and supplement its capabilities. In particular, researchers have focused on sensing users' movement and gestures, aiming to allow users to interact using their body rather than by using a device. Early work included Bolt's put-that-there system developed in the late 1970s, and recent advances in computer vision have allowed the tracking of users' hands, arms, and bodies, leading to a flurry of motion-based gaming controls and inventive, body-based games. The number and variety of research prototypes of non-device UIs have also exploded over the past few years, showing how movements in front of a large display can control navigation, how users can gesture in mid-air, how scratching or poking the skin of one's forearm can be a means of input, and how electric muscle stimulation can be used to move users' limbs as output. Further, HCI researchers have been exploring the theoretical opportunities in using the body for interaction, describing principles for whole-body interaction, embodied interaction, and body-centric interaction, as well as highlighting some of the philosophical and psychological challenges associated with using the body as an interface. First promising applications are being investigated or have been demonstrated in mobile computing, healthcare, or sports. A new UI paradigm seems to be emerging.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main objective of the seminar was to explore on-body interaction through two research areas: embodied cognition and sensor/actuator engineering. The former has driven a lot of thinking and models around on-body technologies and the potential of body-based interaction. The latter has been behind many of the sensors and actuators that have enabled prototypes to be built and to demonstrate the potential of on-body technology. We did this bringing together a group of researchers from embodied cognition (including psychology, robotics, human-computer interaction, art/design, and sociology) as well as sensor/actuator engineering (including computer science, materials science, electrical engineering). Second, we had this diverse group of researchers outline a research agenda for on-body technologies, in part using a bottom-up process at the seminar, in part using structured answers to questions in advance of the seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>In line with the objectives above, the seminar focused on three areas of investigation:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Embodied Cognition</b>: Embodied cognition is a term covering research in linguistics, robotics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, and psychology (e.g., Anderson 2003, Wilson 2002). The core idea in embodied cognition is that our bodies shape thinking broadly understood (including reasoning, memory, and emotion). In contrast to most psychological foundations of HCI, embodied cognition argues that one cannot study the human as a system comprising input (senses), processing (thinking), and output (motor activity), because sensor-motor activity affects thinking fundamentally and, conversely but less radically, because our body reflects more about our thinking than is commonly expected. Thus, bodies and thinking are intertwined, as reflected in embodied cognition book titles like \"How the Body Shapes the Way We Think\" [2] and \"How the Body Shapes the Mind\" [1]. Embodied cognition has become a prominent candidate for outlining what we can and cannot do in on-body interaction.\n\n</li><li><b>Sensor/Actuator Engineering</b>: The engineering of technologies that transform the human body into an interface is a very active research area. A widely used approach uses techniques from visual computing for capturing body gestures and touch input on the body using RGB or depth cameras, while projecting visual output with a body-worn projector. Other approaches build on the transdermal propagation of ultrasound or electromagnetic waves to identify the location of touch contact on human skin. EMG can be used to capture human muscle movement, while Electrical Muscle Stimulation can generate muscle output. Radar is another technology that has been successfully demonstrated very recently for capturing gestural input. A further recent strand in research uses slim skin electronics for sensing and output on the body. These technologies are opening up new avenues for human-computer interaction, by contributing body-based sensing input and output modalities with an increasing resolution and more body compatible form factors. \n\n</li><li><b>New On-Body Technologies</b>: This area concerns how we can combine embodied cognition and sensor/actuator engineering to design on-body technologies. The design of on-body technologies was a key discussion topic, in particular, how to drive the technical development from work on embodied cognition and the body, how to evaluate on-body technology, and how to take the peculiarities and possibilities of the body into consideration. The application areas of on-body technologies were another consideration. \n</li></ul> \n <h3>Activities</h3> \n <img src=\"/storage/media/0003/3722/demo_session.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/> \n <p>\nThe first day of the seminar was reserved for presentations, to establish common ground for discussions. All participants introduced themselves, their background, and their vision in short position talks. \n</p> \n <p>\nFour long talks reviewed the state-of-the-art and presented recent work in key areas. In his talk \"Embodied Cognition: What does having a body gives us?\", David Kirsh emphasized on four topics: Effectivity, Enactive perception, Interactive Cognition, and Experience. They all explore what having a body gives us that goes beyond just having a sensor in space. Katia Vega's talk, entitled \"Beauty Technologies\", focused on the possibilities to embed technology on and inside the skin. Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze gave a talk entitled \"The Affective Body in Interaction\", discussing the high-level principles of affective computing and creating body-affective-aware-computing technology, which involves sensing the affect and emotion of the users and using them for interaction. In his talk \"smetic Computing: Actions and Urgencies towards an Inclusive, Equitable Landscape of On-Body Technologies\", Eric Paulos urged the need for transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches and proposed a framing around \"Cosmetic Computing\".    \n</p> \n <p>\nThe evening featured a demo session. An impressive total number of 8 interactive demos and exhibits were demonstrated in the historical ambiance of the Rokoko-style music hall. Those demos comprised, amongst other, e-textiles, interactive tattoos and make-up, new bio-inspired materials and tactile actuation technologies. \n</p> \n <p>The second day consisted of work in <b>breakout groups</b>. First, groups identified <b>challenges</b> for future work in the field of on-body interaction, grouped into four main areas: Integration of the body and the device; Cognition and Affect; Interaction; and Applications. Next, the participants worked together to identify <b>positive visions</b> of a future with body-based interfaces. Promising aspects that were identified include sensory augmentation of human body for graceful ageing, personalized medication and the idea of legal/democratic framework for controlling wearable technology. To identify potential risks associated with body-based technologies and interaction, the group also developed <b>negative visions</b>. Key problems and risks that were identified include a loss of physical embodiment and substantial security risks of our bodies (and potentially even emotions) being externally controlled.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn an session, entitled academic speed-dating, we randomly paired two participants with each other. Their goal was to developed within 7 minutes an idea and a title for a paper they would write together. The format turned out to be very well-received and to stimulate research ideas at unforeseen intersections between the participants' interest and expertise.\n</p> \n <h3>Conclusion</h3> \n <p>The seminar set out to bring together diverse researchers to discuss the overlap between embodied cognition and sensor/actuator engineering. The group managed to cover advances in on-body sensors and actuator, some of the cognitive consequences of on-body technologies, and open issues in applications of on-body technologies. Further, a range of open questions and exciting research questions were discussed, which will likely foster future collaboration and serve as a generator of future research on on-body technologies. \n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Shaun Gallagher. <em>How the body shapes the mind.</em> Clarendon Press, 2006.\n</li><li> Rolf Pfeifer and Josh Bongard. <em>How the body shapes the way we think: a new view of intelligence.</em> MIT press, 2006.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Kasper Hornbaek, David Kirsh, Joseph A.

Human beings, on the other hand, are excellent at learning from very few data examples, capable of articulating explanations and resolving inconsistencies through reasoning and communication [7, 9, 16, 17].\n</p> <p>\nDespite the recent impact of deep learning, limited progress has been made towards understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying language and vision understanding. Under this motivation, the seminar brought together not only computer scientists, but also specialists in artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, computer vision, neural computation and natural language processing. In particular, the methodology of neural-symbolic computation [4, 7, 12], which\ncan offer a principled interface between the relevant fields, especially symbolic AI and neural computation, was adopted in an attempt to offer a new perspective of reconciling large-scale modelling with human-level understanding, thus building a roadmap for principles and applications of Human-Like Neural-Symbolic Computing.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe techniques and methods of neural-symbolic computation have already been applied\neffectively to a number of areas, leading to developments in deep learning, data science and\nhuman-like computing [3]. For instance, neural-symbolic integration methods have been\napplied to temporal knowledge evolution in dynamic scenarios [6, 10, 14], action learning\nin video understanding [10], uncertainty learning and reasoning [1], argument learning in\nmultiagent scenarios [7, 8], hardware and software verification and learning [2], ontology\nlearning [13] and distributed temporal deep learning in general, with several applications in\ncomputer science [2, 10, 14].\n</p> \n <p>\nSpecifically, in this Dagstuhl Seminar we aimed at: (i) building better bridges between\nsymbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning and learning, and between big data and human-like\nlearning; (ii) comparative analyses and evaluations of the explanatory capacity of language\nmodelling tools and techniques; (iii) design and applications of knowledge extraction methods\nand techniques towards life-long learning and transfer learning.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar consisted of contributed and invited talks, breakout and joint group discussion\nsessions, and scientific hackathons. After each presentation or discussion session, open\nproblems were identified and questions were raised. The area is clearly growing in importance,\ngiven recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. In particular, the need\nfor explainability in AI clearly poses relevant questions to learning methodologies, including\ndeep learning. In summary, the main research directions identified by participants are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Explainable AI: The recent success of deep learning in vision and language processing, associated with the growing complexity of big data applications has led to the need for explainable AI models. In neural-symbolic computing, rule extraction, interpretability, comprehensibility leading to the development of integrated systems, are one of the principled alternatives to lead these efforts [5, 7], as discussed in the Explainability hackathon. Furthermore, the concept of modularity in multimodal learning in deep networks is crucial to the development of the field and can help achieve knowledge extraction (as identified in [5, 6]) which can result in the development of effective\nknowledge extraction methods towards explainable AI, as discussed in the deep learning with symbols hackathon.\n</li><li>Hybrid Cognitive Architectures: The development of Cognitive Architectures capable of simulating and explaining aspects of human cognition also remains an important research endeavour. Some cognitive architectures typically consider symbolic representations, whereas others employ neural simulations. The integration of these models remains a challenge and there are benefits on integrating the accomplishments of both paradigms, as identified in the cognitive architectures hackathon.\n</li><li>Statistical Relational Learning: Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) [11] provides a model that integrates symbolic knowledge (encoded as first-order logic relations) and subsymbolic knowledge (represented as feature vectors). The LTNs enable the representation of relational knowledge infusion into deep networks, and knowledge completion and distilling through querying the networks. There remains a number of challenges in integrating, explaining and computing symbolic knowledge in deep networks. Both LTNs [11] and Connectionist Modal and Temporal Logics [6, 7, 14] offer effective alternatives towards these research challenges, as explored in the LTN hackathon.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar builds upon previous seminars and workshops on the integration of computational learning and symbolic reasoning, such as the Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy) workshop series, and the previous Dagstuhl Seminar 14381: Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning [5].\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Tarek R.

Open questions that\nwere of interest to this group include new methods for circuit synthesis\nand optimization, compiler optimizations and rewriting, embedded languages\nversus non-embedded languages, implementations of type systems and error\nreporting for quantum languages, techniques for verifying the correctness\nof quantum programs, and new techniques for compiling efficient circuits\nand protocols for fault-tolerant questions and their 2D layout.\n</p> \n <p>\nQuantum computing is getting real. Several laboratories around the world\nare implementing hardware platforms. For instance, systems based on superconducting qubits, such as those at IBM, Google, Intel, the University of Maryland, ionQ, and Rigetti are now scaling into the 50-150 qubit range.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile research on the theoretical side of the field addressed fundamental\nquestions such as how to best leverage this new model of computation for\nalgorithmic applications, a topic that has received significantly less\nattention is how to actually program quantum computers. To take advantage\nof the immense computing power offered by quantum computers as they come\nonline in the coming years, software tools will be essential. We want these\ntools to be available, efficient and reliable, so that we can quickly and\nreliably reap the positive benefits that quantum computers have to offer.\n</p> \n <p>\nIt is clear that quantum programming will require tools for automatically\ngenerating large-scale circuits and for synthesizing circuits from\nelementary fault-tolerant gates which then can be carried out by a future\nquantum computer. However, it is less clear what the best way will be to go\nabout these challenging issues. Questions that were discussed at the\nseminar include the following:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>How can we program a quantum computer? What are the basic structures\n  that a language should support and how can a compiler help a user develop\n  abstract/high-level reasoning about algorithms?\n</li><li> How do we model the underlying instruction set? As currently the\n  underlying hardware is quickly evolving, how can we best model a\n  fault-tolerant quantum computer?\n</li><li> How to compile and optimize quantum programs? Automatic translation\n  of high-level programs into circuits will be key to program quantum\n  computers. How to design good tools for this?\n</li><li> How to we test and verify quantum programs? Given that it is hard for\n  classical computers to simulate the time evolution of a quantum computer,\n  how can we ascertain correctness of a circuit?\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe seminar brought together some 44 researchers with diverse skill sets from\nquantum computing, mathematical foundations of programming languages,\nimplementation of programming languages, and formal verification.  The\nseminar consisted of 23 talks, as well as a number of vibrant discussion sessions and a software demonstration session. The sessions where:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>Wine Cellar discussion, moderated by Sabine Glesner. This was our first discussion session. We discussed the questions raised by Sabine Glesner during her talk: Why do we need quantum programming languages? Which ``killer applications'' would make quantum programming languages successful? What are appropriate abstractions from quantum hardware? What are theoretical models for quantum computing?\n</li><li> Discussion session on Debugging, moderated by Rodney Van Meter. This session focused on what are appropriate debugging techniques for quantum computing. The issue arises because the most common classical debugging technique, setting break points and examining the program state, cannot be applied in the context of quantum computing.\n</li><li> Discussion session on Challenge Problems for Quantum Computing, moderated by Earl Campbell. In this session, we discussed coming up with well-defined problems with some success quantifier for quantum computation, similar to the successful SAT competitions. \n</li><li>Group survey session on a Bird's Eye View on Quantum Languages, moderated by Robert Rand. In this session, the group compiled a list of all quantum programming languages and toolkits we are currently aware of, and classified them according to various criteria, for example, whether the languages are imperative or functional, whether the computational paradigm is circuit generation or Knill's QRAM model, whether the language is high-level or assembly, whether it supports type-safety and/or verification, etc.\n</li><li> Group survey session on Tools for Quantum Optimization, moderated by Matthew Amy. In this session, the group compiled a list of available tools for optimization of quantum circuits.\n</li><li> Group discussion on Opportunities for Education and Outreach, moderated by Rodney Van Meter. The discussion centered on new opportunities for public outreach and education that are enabled by the emergence of new quantum tools. \n</li><li> Software demonstration session, moderated by Martin Roetteler. In this session, 10 researchers gave rapid demonstrations, of a about 10 minutes each, of various software tools they have designed.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nMost of the participants rated the seminar as a success. We managed to \nconnect researchers from different communities, and engaged in \na vibrant exchange of novel ideas, and started to tackle important problems\nsuch as the analysis of quantum algorithms for real-world computational\nproblems, compiler optimizations, reversible computing, and fault-tolerant\nquantum computing.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Michele Mosca, Martin Roetteler, and Peter Selinger\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe next big change in the automotive domain will be the move towards semi-automated and automated driving. The pathway to autonomous driving supported by rapid advance of a wide range of novel vehicle-related technology presents industry, academia, and regulatory agencies with new opportunities and challenges in re-imagining human interactions in the vehicle. While expectations are high towards automated driving the revolution will proceed in incremental steps; with the progress of technology new tasks and driving phases will be supported by automation. All of this will unfold in traffic scenarios in which different levels of automation will coexist for many years in which user interfaces play a key role.\n</p> \n <p>We see three core challenges for automotive user interfaces in the age of automation, which we have addressed during the seminar.\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Transforming vehicles into places of productivity and play.</b> People in automated vehicles will be able to turn their attention to non-driving tasks some of the time, or even much of the time. This will allow user interface designers to explore a range of possible interactions, which are might be too distracting in manually driven vehicles. For highly automated vehicles our constraints will have to do less with the driver\u2019s attention to the road, and more with the characteristics of the vehicle, such as the area available for interaction, the motion of the vehicle, as well as its computational power and the sensors that are available in the cockpit. User interactions will include other people in the vehicle, but might also include people in other vehicles. Novel user interfaces may turn the car into an infotainment and entertainment platform in which the automation allows for new secondary tasks in the car with driver and passengers that were not possible before.  \n</li><li><b>Re-engagement of drivers into the driving task.</b> As automated driving makes advances, drivers will often be able to disengage from driving, and safely turn their attention to a secondary task. But until our vehicles are fully automated, drivers will eventually have to re-engage in driving. As the non-driving tasks may vary in time but also in the engagement of the user, it will be a challenge to safely and timely return to the primary task. For handling a critical situation the driver must perceive, and act upon, a sequence of information and entities. This can be a complex maneuver in a traffic scenario but also a time critical course of actions in the treatment of an emergency case. Much work needs to be done on user interface design in order to make re-engagement in different kinds of situations and different kinds of complexity safe. \n</li><li><b>Collaboration in mixed traffic scenarios.</b>\nTraffic automation will come to the streets peu-a-peu. Thereby and for many years, mixed scenarios in which vehicles with no-, partial-, and full automation will coexist and cooperate in daily traffic. This road sharing involves communicating autonomous operations to the driver of the autonomous car and also a communication strategy to keep non-autonomous vehicles and their drivers in the loop. Road sharing means avoiding collisions, but automated vehicles will also cooperate, for example by traveling in platoons in order to save energy and improve the utilization of the road infrastructure. Research is needed to create user interfaces that allow for safe operation of the vehicle in all of these mixed traffic scenarios.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Along with these topics, we also discussed the role of trust, e.g., how user interfaces will support the communication of trust in typical situations with mixed levels of automation. We further discussed about future technologies in and around the car (e.g., novel sensors, interaction concepts, and feedback systems) and about the recent strategy change of automakers to fund apps and invest a lot in app development to make car dashboards/instrument clusters more sustainable.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar brought together researchers from human computer interaction, cognitive psychology, human factors, psychology, and also from automotive industry and OEMs to discuss the new interface paradigms for (semi-)automated driving.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Susanne Boll, Andrew Kun, and Andreas Riener\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Identifying Key Enablers in Edge Intelligence",
            "data": "\n <p>\nEdge computing, a key part of the upcoming 5G mobile networks and future 6G technologies, promises to decentralize cloud applications while providing more bandwidth and reducing latencies. The promises are delivered by moving application-specific computations between the cloud, the data-producing devices, and the network infrastructure components at the edges of wireless and fixed networks. The previous works have shown that edge computing devices are capable of executing computing tasks with high energy efficiency, and when combined with comparable computing power to server computers.\n </p> \n <p>\nIn stark contrast to the current edge-computing development, current artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular machine-learning (ML) methods assume computations are conducted in a powerful computational infrastructure, such as a  homogeneous cloud with ample computational and data storage resources available. This model requires transmitting data from end-user devices to the cloud, requiring significant bandwidth and suffering from latency. Bringing computation close to the end-user devices would be essential for reducing latency and ensuring real-time response for applications and services. Currently, however, these benefits cannot be achieved as the perspective of \"edge for AI\", or even \"communication for AI2, has been understudied. Indeed, previous studies address AI only limitedly in different perspectives of the Internet of Things, edge computing, and networks.\n</p> \n <p>\nClear benefits can be identified from the interplay of ML/AI and edge computing. We divide this interplay into edge computing for AI and AI for edge computing. Distributed AI functionality can further be divided into edge computing for communication, platform control, security, privacy, and application or service-specific aspects. Edge computing for AI centres on the challenge of adapting the current centralized ML and autonomous decision-making algorithms to the intermittent connectivity and the distributed nature of edge computing. AI for edge computing, on the other hand, concentrates on using AI methods to improve the edge applications or the functionalities provided by the edge computing platform by enhancing connectivity, network orchestration, edge platform management, privacy or security, or providing autonomy and personalized intelligence on application level.\n</p> \n <p>\nPrevious studies address accommodating AI methods for different perspectives of IoT, edge computing and networks. However, there is still a need to understand the holistic view of AI methods and capabilities in the context of edge computing, comprising for example predictive data analysis, machine learning, reasoning, and autonomous agents with learning and cognitive capabilities. Further, the edge environment with its opportunistic nature, intermittent connectivity, and interplay of numerous stakeholders present a unique environment for deploying such applications based on computations units with different degrees of intelligence capabilities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe AI methods used in edge computing can be further divided into learning and decision making. Learning refers to building, maintaining and making predictions with ML models, especially neural networks. Decision making is the business logic, that is, the process of acting upon the predictions. This is the domain of decision theory, control theory and game theory, whose solutions and equilibrium are now often estimated with data by reinforcement learning methods.\n</p> \n <p>\nCurrently, AI's cloud-centric architecture requires transmitting raw data from the end-user devices to the cloud, introducing latencies, endangering privacy and consuming significant data transmission resources. The next step, currently under active research, is distributed or federated AI, which builds and maintains a central model in the cloud or on the edge but allows user devices to update the model and use it locally for predictions. We envision a fully decentralized AI which flattens the distributed hierarchy, with the joint model built and maintained by devices, edge nodes and cloud nodes with equal responsibility.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe present challenges for AI in edge computing converge on 1) finding novel neural network architectures and their topological splits, with the associated training and inference algorithms with fast and reliable accuracy and 2) distributing and decentralized model building and sharing into the edge, by allowing local, fast-to-build personalized models and global, collaborative models, and information sharing. Finally, the novel methods need to be 3) integrated with key algorithmic solutions to be utilised in edge-native AI applications. The ground-breaking objectives and novel concepts edge-native artificial intelligence brings are:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Edge-native AI can be used for obtaining higher quality data from massive Internet of Things, Web of Things, and other edge networks by filtering out large volumes of noise, context labelling, dynamic sampling, data cleaning, etc. High-quality data can thus be used to feed both edge inferencing and cloud-based data analysis systems, for example, training large-scale machine learning models.\n    </li><li> Edge computing provides low latency that is crucial especially for real-time applications, such as anything related to driving and smart mobility.

            "title": "Deduction Beyond First-Order Logic",
            "data": "\n <p>Much research on automated deduction has traditionally focused on\nautomated reasoning in first-order logic. First-order logic with\nequality is generally considered a sweet spot on the logic design\ncontinuum. Yet, from the point of view of several applications it can\nbe too restrictive as a modeling and reasoning tool. In recent years,\nthere has been a realization that while first-order reasoning is very\nuseful to discharge the bulk of proof obligations, it must be tightly\nintegrated with richer features to be useful in many\napplications. Practical problems often need a mixture of first-order\nproof search and some more advanced reasoning, for instance, about\nnon-first-order-axiomatisable theories, higher-order formulas, or\nsimply higher-level reasoning steps.\n</p> \n <p>\nFirst-order logic cannot be used to finitely axiomatize many\ninteresting theories, such as those including transitive closure\noperators, inductive predicates, datatypes, and standard arithmetic on\nintegers or reals. Even provers that provide native support for some\nof these theories typically fail to prove trivial-looking problems\nbecause they lack general support for mathematical induction. Some applications\nneed a richer set of constructs than those provided by first-order\nlogic such as, for instance, the separating conjunction (*) and\nmagic wand (-*) connectives of Separation Logic or the\ndisjunctive well-foundedness predicates used in HSF, a popular\napproach to software model checking based on first-order Horn logic.\n</p> \n <p>\nThere are potential synergies between automatic first-order proving\nand verification methods developed in the context of richer\nlogics. However, they have not received enough attention by the\nvarious deduction sub-communities so far. In general, there is a\ncultural gap between the various deduction communities that hinders\ncross-fertilization of ideas and progress.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl Seminar brought together experts in automated reasoning\nin first-order logic and researchers working on deduction methods and tools that go beyond first-order logic. The latter included specialists on proof\nmethods for induction, proof planning, and other higher-order or\nhigher-level procedures; and consumers of deduction technology whose\nspecification languages contain non-first-order features. The main\ngoal of the seminar was to exchange ideas and explore ways to\nfacilitate the transition from first-order to more expressive\nsettings.\n</p> \n <p>Research questions that were discussed and answered at the seminar\nincluded the following:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>What higher-order features do applications need, and what\n  features can be incorporated smoothly in existing first-order proof\n  calculi and provers?\n</li><li> How can we best extend first-order reasoning techniques beyond first-order logic?\n</li><li>  Can proof-assistant-style automation and first-order reasoning techniques be combined in a synergetic fashion?\n</li><li>  What are good strategies for automatic induction and coinduction or invariant synthesis?\n</li><li> Is a higher layer of reasoning, in the spirit of proof planning, necessary to solve more difficult higher-order problems?\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jasmin Christian Blanchette, Carsten Fuhs, Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans, and Cesare Tinelli\n                </div> \n",

The advent of new programmable\nhardware platforms, research and wide deployment of distributed\ncomputing technologies for data processing, as well as new exciting\nuse cases such as distributed Machine Learning and Metaverse-style\nubiquitous computing are now inspiring research of more fine-granular\nand more principled approaches to distributed computing in the\n\"Edge-To-Cloud Continuum\".\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Compute-First Networking Dagstuhl seminar has brought together\nresearchers and practitioners in the fields of distributed computing,\nnetwork programmability, Internet of Things, and data analytics to\nexplore the potential, possible technological components, as well as\nopen research questions in an exciting new field that will likely\ninduce a paradigm shift for networking and its relationship with\ncomputing.\n</p> \n <p>\nTraditional overlay-based in-network computing is typically limited to\nquite specific purposes, for example CDN-style edge computing. At the\nsame time, network programmability approaches such as Software-Defined\nNetworking and corresponding languages such as P4 are often perceived\nas too limited for application-level programming. Compute-First\nNetworking (CFN) views networking and computing holistically and aims\nat leveraging network programmability, server- and serverless\nin-network computing and modern distributed computing abstraction to\ndevelop a new system's approach for an environment where computing is\nnot merely and add-on to existing networks, but where networking is\nre-imagined with a broader and ubiquitous notion of programmability.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe expect this approach to enable several benefits: it can help to\nunlock distributed computing from the existing silos of individual\ncloud and CDN platforms - a necessary condition to enable Keiichi\nMatsuda's vision of Hyper-Reality and Metaverse concepts where the\nphysical world, human users and different forms of analytics, and\nvisual rendering services constantly engage in information exchanges,\ndirectly at the edges of the network. It can also help to provide\nreliable, scalable, privacy-preserving and universally available\nplatforms for Distributed Machine Learning applications that will play\na key role in future large-scale data collection and analytics.\n</p> \n <p>\nCFN's integrated approach allows for several optimizations, for\nexample a more informed and more adaptive resource optimization that\ncan take into account dynamically changing network conditions,\navailability of utilization of compute platforms as well as\napplication requirements and adaptation boundaries, thus enabling more\nresponsive and better-performing applications.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeveral interesting research challenges have been identified that\nshould be addressed in order to realize the CFN vision: How should the\ndifferent levels of programmability in todays system be integrated\ninto a consistent approach? How would programming and communication\nabstractions look like? How do orchestration systems need to evolve in\norder to be usable in these potentially large scale scenarios? How can\nbe guarantee security and privacy properties of a distributed\ncomputing slice without having to rely on just location attributes?\nHow would the special requirements and properties of relevant\napplications such as Distributed Machine best be mapped to CFN -- or\nshould distributed data processing for federated or split Machine\nLearning play a more prominent role in designing CFN abstractions?\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar was an important first step in identifying the potential\nand a first set of interesting new research challenges for re-imaging\ndistributed computing through CFN - an exciting new topic for\nnetworking and distributed computing research.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\">\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </img></a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Dirk Kutscher\n                </div> \n",

In particular, Johnson (Section 3.12) and Muth (Section 3.17)\nreported on models and research opportunities in the cloud and external memory motivated\nby practical demands.\n</p> \n <p>\nA number of talks highlighted technical challenges in storing and processing large datasets: Bast (Section 3.2) demonstrated the knowledge database QLever and discussed algorithmic aspects. Distributed frameworks were presented by Bingmann (Section 3.4) reporting on the progress of Thrill while focusing on parallel external sorting and by Yan (Section 3.32) who introduced G-thinker. Farach-Colton (Section 3.7) analyzed the slow-down of various filesystems caused by updates over time. Owens (Section 3.19) discuses intricacies of GPUs\nand presented efficient and practical data structures for this hardware.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn order to mitigate the impact of huge datasets, streaming and online algorithms were considered. Martinez (Section 3.15) discussed Affirmative Sampling which takes uniform samples of a stream and adapts the sample size to the stream\u2019s diversity. Sedgewick (Section 3.26) revisited the cardinality estimation problem and proposed the HyperBitBit algorithm. A matching of requests to resources in an online setting was covered by Raghvendra\n(Section 3.22). Similarly, Mehlhorn (Section 3.16) presented a solution to assigning indivisible resources approximately optimizing the social welfare.\n</p> \n <p>\nNebel (Section 3.18) and Wild (Section 3.31) proposed and analyzed tree-based data structures. Additionally, various aspects on more general graph processing were covered ranging from their enumeration (Lumbroso, Section 3.14) and random sampling (Penschuck, Section 3.20), over representations for k-connectivity (Pettie, Section 3.21) to the detection of substructures (Silvestri, Section 3.28 and Tarjan, Section 3.29).\n</p> \n <p>\nRegarding the complexity of graph algorithms, Fagerberg (Section 3.23) presented new lower bounds on the reorganisation cost of B-trees, while Thankachan (Section 3.30) gave hardness results on the recognizability of Wheeler graphs. Kopelowitz (Section 3.13) considered the complexity of data structures for the set-disjointness problem. Emphasizing cloud-related security concerns, Jacob (Section 3.11) showed that a range of simple data structures have to incur an (log n) overhead if one wants to prevent information leakage\nvia their access patterns.\n</p> \n <p>\nProblems involving large text corpora were considered by Fischer (Section 3.8) presenting an external memory bi-directional compression scheme, by Golin (Section 3.9) discussing AIFV codes, and by Salinger (Section 3.24) analyzing persistent full-text indices for versioned documents.\n</p> \n <p>\nData structures using hashing were examined by Conway (Section 3.5), Dietzfelbinger (Section 3.6), Even and Sanders (Section 3.25). Bender (Section 3.3) discussed variants of Bloom filters which adapt based on past queries.\n</p> \n <p>\nAfshani (Section 3.1) presented Fragile Complexity, a novel model of computation with an element-centric cost function, and gave bounds for various classical problems. Iacono (Section 3.10) proposed to model locality-of-reference more explicitly and compared his proposal to the external memory and cache-oblivious model. Sen (Section 3.27) proposed the novel paradigm HAIbrid augmenting classic data structures with aritifical intelligence.\n</p> \n <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> \n <p>\nThe organizers would like to thank the Dagstuhl team for their continuous support;\nthe welcoming atmosphere made the seminar both highly productive and enjoyable.\nThey also thank all participants for their contributions to this seminar.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gerth St\u00f8lting Brodal, Ulrich Carsten Meyer, Markus E.

            "title": "Data Consistency in Distributed Systems: Algorithms, Programs, and Databases",
            "data": "\n <p>\nLarge-scale distributed systems have become ubiquitous, and there are a variety of options to develop, deploy, and operate such applications. Typically, this type of application is data-centric: it retrieves, stores, modifies, forwards, and processes data from different sources.  However, guaranteeing availability, preventing data loss, and providing efficient storage solutions are still major challenges that a growing number of programmers are facing when developing large-scale distributed systems.\nIn our seminar, we brought together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners to discuss the status quo of data consistency in distributed systems. As result of talks and discussions, we identified several topics of interest that can be grouped into the following four areas.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Theoretical foundations:</b> The seminar included a tutorial on specification of consistency guarantees provided by distributed systems and talks on comparing different styles of specification and expressing replicated data type semantics in Datalog. Different specification styles are suitable for different purposes and more work is needed to identify the most appropriate ones. The seminar also included talks on formally reasoning about which consistency levels are enough to satisfy correctness properties of applications. The talks demonstrated that formal verification is a promising approach to cope with the challenge of selecting appropriate consistency levels.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Distributed systems and database technologies:</b> With the growing number of replicated data stores, the two fields of distributed systems and databases are moving closer together. The communities should be made more aware of each others results. A common concern in agreement, i.e., ensuring that database copies are updated correctly. Traditionally, the distributed systems community has based many of their approaches on classical consensus algorithms or looked at weaker consistency models. In contrast, database systems focused most work on 2-phase commit protocols and eager update protocols. At the same time, the database community also considered other ACID aspects that required to combine commit protocols with concurrency control protocols and recovery schemes. In the last decade however, and in particular with practical implementations of the Paxos consensus algorithms, and the use of file replication in storage systems for availability, work of the two communities has come closer together. A challenge in this context is that work that emerges from the different communities still makes slightly different assumptions about failure and correctness models. They can often be quite subtle so that the differences are not obvious, even to the experts. And they can lead to very different approaches to find solutions. Bridging this gap in terms of understanding each other, and the implications of correctness and failure models remains a challenging task. As an example, the separation of the concepts of atomicity, isolation and durability in the database world offers many opportunities for optimization, but includes extra complexity when analyzing which algorithms are appropriate in which situations.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Conflict-handling in highly-scalable systems:</b> In the last years, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) have been adopted by an ever-growing number of products and companies to deal with high-availability requirements under concurrent modifications of data.  Recent advances in related techniques for collaborative editing might make it possible that hundreds of people work together on a shared document or data item with limited performance impact. Several talks presented programming guidelines, static analyses, and related tools for safe usage of CRDTs in situations where eventual consistency is not enough to maintain application invariants.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Programming models for distributed systems:</b> Micro-services have become a standard approach for constructing large-scale distributed systems, though microservice composition and scalability raises a lot of questions. Some presentations discussed current work on actor-based and data-flow programming.  Design for testability and test frameworks are crucial for providing reliable services, but they currently require a lot of experience as of today. We believe that future progress on programming models and new results in theoretical foundations will help to simplify this challenging task and support programmers in building safe systems.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Annette Bieniusa, Alexey Gotsman, Bettina Kemme, and Marc Shapiro\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Software Business, Platforms, and Ecosystems: Fundamentals of Software Production Research",
            "data": "\n <p>\nSoftware producing organizations (SPOs) face challenges every day. Whether they are open source consortia or commercial software product companies, they all face the challenges of changing demands, rapidly evolving technology, and a dynamic ecosystem in which their products and services need to operate. SPOs need to rethink their operating models and benefit from current and future trends. E.g. agile software development and DevOps allow them to respond swiftly to changes in their environment, embracing uncertainty. Particularly in conjunction with machine learning and artificial intelligence, SPOs can generate strategic competitive advantages. Particularly companies with a long history in a given domain, such as SAP and Volkswagen, seem to be too comfortable with their status quo. Meanwhile, smaller companies drive innovation on many fronts. Examples are Provenance that benefits from blockchain technology to revolutionize trust in goods, or Tesla and Local Motors that push autonomous cars into consumer markets.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe challenge to make these organizations successful is multi-disciplinary. First, there exist technology challenges, such as eliciting and prioritizing requirements, dealing with platforms and technology standards, and operating in complex technology landscapes that constrain and enable their technology. Secondly, there exist adoption challenges: organizations need to find ways to convince their target users to adopt their technologies and to coordinate evolving technologies to provide the most valuable end-user experience. Thirdly, there exist business model challenges, where these organizations must find ways to maximize profit from their innovations and technologies. Because of the pervasiveness of software, the challenges are observed everywhere in the economy, whether it is logistics, online marketing, or e-health. Furthermore, they are applicable to organizations in every stage of development, whether it is a software startup or a software giant that has influenced the market consistently for decades.\n</p> \n <p>\nHence, this Dagstuhl Seminar invited thought leaders from academia and industry to share their knowledge and experiences. Participants were asked to share a short position statement of max 300 words and participate in the development of a groundbreaking research agenda. These efforts aimed to increase visibility and impact of software production research and to set a course for the next decades. In addition, the seminar helped bringing together scholars and industry practitioners from different communities, such as product management, technology management, information systems, software engineering, and human-computer interaction in order to sharpen and define the joint community of Software-intensive Business (see Section 4.3.1).\n</p> \n <p>\nA central outcome of the seminar was the agreement to use the term Software-intensive Business in order to describe the joint community with members of great diversity. Furthermore, the seminar focused on\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> defining core concepts and identifying a roadmap\n</li><li> Software-intensive Business and technology artifacts\n</li><li> research needs in continuous experimentation &amp; innovation\n</li><li> lifecycle and research of software ecosystems\n</li><li> research data for Software-intensive Businesses\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nAs a major result from the seminar, the following achievements have been identified: \n</p> \n <ol>\n<li> research a clear agenda for the field of Software-intensive Business research\n</li><li> carving out trends and research challenges in further depth\n</li><li> forming groups for continuous collaborations on different elements of the research agenda\n</li><li> organize bi-weekly meetings on-line for community building and research sharing.\n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Slinger Janse and Karl Werder\n                </div> \n",

Thus a compiled program may behave erroneously even when the source form of it appears entirely correct.\n</p> \n <p>\nDespite the common wisdom that \"it is never the compiler's fault\", bugs in compilers are in fact relatively common, and finding them is a challenging and active area of research.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis seminar brought together researchers in that area with a broader group of researchers and practitioners in software testing and verification,\nand in compiler development itself, to share their experiences and discuss the open questions and challenges that the field presents. The goal was to brainstorm new ideas for how to approach these challenges, and to help foster longer-term collaborations between the participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar involved a number of talks from participants about their particular areas of work and research,\nfollowed by working groups where various specific challenges were discussed.\nIt then concluded with an open panel session on the challenges and concepts of compiler testing and verification.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis report presents the collection of abstracts associated with the participant presentations,\nfollowed by notes summarising each discussion session and the concluding panel,\nwhich we provide as a resource for researchers who are interested in understanding \nthe state of the art and open problems in this field.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    David R.

            "title": "Hyperspectral, Multispectral, and Multimodal (HMM) Imaging: Acquisition, Algorithms, and Applications",
            "data": "\n <p>\nOn the last day of the seminar, the attendees had a very intense discussion about the usefulness of the seminar itself, the grand challenges related to the highly interdisciplinary field of research, and the next steps that should be taken in order to further improve on the cross-fertilizing effects in hyperspectral, multispectral, and multimodal imaging.\n</p> \n <h3>Take Home Messages</h3> \n <p>\nAll attendees agreed on the high quality and open mindedness of the discussions at both, the group level, e.g., in the plenary sessions and the working groups, and also on personal level. All participants assess this Dagstuhl seminar as a great success, especially due to the interdisciplinary discussion and the new insights resulting from this. Despite differences of the individual fields present in the seminar, e.g., remote sensing, color reproduction, and material classification, and despite the wide variety of applications such as medical, environmental monitoring, and arts, a large set of common questions and problems could be identified. All attendees highly\nappreciated the fact, that unlike in conferences, which usually have a rather narrow perspective on HMM challenges and solutions, as they usually address a single community with a very similar perspective on the field, this seminar brought together people with very different points of view.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl seminar was a starting point of a number of connections that could be established directly, and several mid-, and maybe even long-term collaborations and joint research actions. There have been several highlights related to the full pipeline from data acquisition, via data processing to applications.\n</p> \n <h3>Grand Challenges</h3> \n <p>On the basis of common and interdisciplinary ground setup in this seminar, several challenges have been identified, which the seminar's attendees see as important to be addressed in further research and engineering work.\n</p> \n <p><b>Data Acquisition</b> Independent of the specific range of the addressed electromagnetic spectrum, the seminar participants see a severe restriction in the usage of HMM sensors due to their inflexibility, e.g., in selecting spectral bands, bulkiness, high calibration efforts, and acquisition speed (see also the working group report on this topic). Enhancing on these limiting factors has the potential to bring about fundamentally new spins in various application domains. Some approaches presented at the workshop have the potential to push back these limits to some degree. On the other hand, most likely there will be no general purpose HMM acquisition device available in the next decades that covers the majority of application requirements. Still, the seminar attendees agree on the importance of enhancing the applicability of existing and future acquisition devices towards more flexible band selection, fast and efficient, (semi-)automated calibration, and, for some applications, compactness. Ideally, future research provides means for an abstract definition of application specific characteristics from which a specific selection and/ or instantiation of an acquisition device can be deduced.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Data Processing and Validation</b> Regarding data processing and validation, three main topics have been discussed: The usefulness and limitations of machine learning and, especially, deep learning (see working group report), the importance of verified and metric data, and the need for a proper reference and benchmarking data set. Even though there are and have been ongoing activities in spectral normalization and validation, e.g., on the level of CIE or other standardization institutions, or in the field of metrology, there still is the lack of widely existing and accepted methods and data even if restricted to specific fields of application.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar participants see a huge potential in all three areas. Still, major obstacles have to be overcome in order to leverage these potentials. In machine learning/ deep learning, one main issue is the lack of guarantees that the results obey specific constraints to, e.g., physical limits or relations. The lack of verified, metric data, and proper reference and benchmarking data, on the other hand, can only be overcome if there is a stronger common basis for best practice within and, even more important, between the HMM sub-disciplines.\n</p> \n <p><b>Information Exchange</b> The existence of common information bases is tightly linked to the prior point regarding data processing and validation. So far, there are only few options and pseudo-standard for sharing data and algorithms. While there are good examples, e.g., Open CV library in computer vision, setting up this kind of \"standard\" is, and will be, much harder in the diverse and partially fragmented HMM research domain. Apparently, this chicken-egg problem can only be solved from within the involved research domains themselves by the normative power of fact of the actions taken by the researchers themselves. \n</p> \n <h3>Next Steps</h3> \n <p>Participants discussed various options for future activity as a follow-up on this Dagstuhl seminar. As one essential restriction of the discussion, attendees became aware of their own limitations in knowing all relevant work and requirements existing in the HMM research subfields. Therefore, the obvious approach to enhance the fields\u2019 convergence by publications, e.g., a special issue or book, and/ or workshops has not the highest priority, even though\nan introductory workshop or piece of literature for 1st year PhD students would be highly appreciated.\n</p> \n <p>\nHowever, participants of Dagstuhl seminar see two main options to proceed in order to keep the initiated process of convergence going and to improve on at least two of the three main challenges identified, i.e., regarding data processing and validation and the exchange of information.\n</p> \n <p><b>HMM Webpage:</b> As there is a severe lack in common information widely used and recognized, the group of researchers who attended Dagstuhl seminar see the potential of a common, web-based information platform. \n</p> \n <p>In this respect, Masahiro Yamaguchi is open to provide the already established web-link multispectral.org and Andreas Kolb will investigate options for setting up and hosting this kind of platform. In any case, this kind of activity needs to rest on several shoulders, thus the attendees are called to follow through with the activities, on the operative level.\n</p> \n <p><b>Follow-up Dagstuhl Seminar:</b> As Dagstuhl supports follow-up seminars, the attendees agree on the usefulness of having this kind of seminar in order to evaluate the common, interdisciplinary activities that arose from the first Dagstuhl seminar. In case of a new edition of the workshop, participants agree on having more industrial partners involved.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Gonzalo R.

            "data": "\n <p>\nDNA is often described as the blueprint of life, since it encodes all the information necessary for an organism to develop and maintain its biological functions. Single blueprints for specific functions are stored inside DNA regions called genes. The primary product produced (also termed expressed) from genes is RNA, which can either become biologically active itself (non-coding RNA or ncRNA) or is further translated into proteins (messenger RNA or mRNA), which then executes the gene functions. Given the astonishing complexity of biological functions, it is not surprising that the regulation of gene expression itself is a highly complex matter. Proteins, RNA, and DNA all can interact with each other, forming regulatory networks in order to control the expression of genes. To elucidate these networks, experimental scientists rely more and more on high-throughput methods, producing vast amounts of raw data. Computational methods to analyze these huge datasets are therefore of highest demand. The main focus of this seminar lies on RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. In particular, transcriptome-wide binding patterns of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), their computational predictability, and the biological effects of binding are discussed. Moreover, the seminar dealt with topics like combinatorial RBP binding prediction, RBP binding kinetics, RNA-RNA interaction prediction, subcellular RNA imaging, and RBP binding site classification. Regarding the computational methodology, several newly developed deep learning methods are presented, e.g. for RBP binding site prediction. Taken together, the aim of the seminar is to bring experimental and computational scientists together for the aforementioned topics and to engage them in fruitful discussions in order to:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>present the current experimental and computational methodologies,\n</li><li>understand their implications, strengths, and limitations from first-hand experience,\n</li><li>and spark ideas for developing new computational and experimental methods and improving on existing ones.\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Rolf Backofen, Yael Mandel-Gutfreund, Uwe Ohler, and Gabriele Varani\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nComputational complexity studies the amount of resources (such as time, space, randomness, or communication) that are necessary to solve computational problems in various models of computation. Finding efficient algorithms for solving computational tasks is crucial for practical applications. Despite a long line of research, for many problems that arise in practice it is not known if they can be solved efficiently \u2013 in particular, in polynomial time. Beside questions about the existence of polynomial time algorithms for problems like Satisfiability or Factoring, where the best known algorithms run in exponential time, there is a huge class of practical problems where algorithms with polynomial running time (such as cubic or even quadratic time) are known, but it would be important to establish whether these running times are best possible, to what extent they can be improved, and whether parallel algorithms allow improvements of the runtime. \n</p> \n <p>\nThese fundamental questions motivate developments in various areas from algorithm design to circuit complexity, communication complexity and proof complexity. During this Dagstuhl Seminar 21121,  some of the most exciting recent developments in those areas related to computational complexity were presented in a series of talks.  The seminar was the most recent one in the series of Dagstuhl Seminars entitled \"Computational Complexity of Discrete Problems\" - seminars 19121, 17121, 14121, 11121.\n</p> \n <p>\nOwing to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions, the seminar was held in a purely online format. With 52 researchers  from across the world participating in the event, resident in time zones ranging from Japan to California, the window for common acceptable time slots was small. We decided to have a two-hour time slot each day for technical sessions, followed by an additional hour or more each day for social interactions. The Webex platform was used for technical sessions, and gather.town additionally for some of the social interactions. Despite the challenges of making the online event interesting given the ubiquitous screen-time fatigue, the meetings saw high participation level (between at least 80% and typically over 90% participation on all days) and were highly interactive - primarily due to the excellent nature of the given talks. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started with the creation of a  \"graph of interests\" (using a Miro whiteboard), enabling participants to discover shared research interests with other participants. Following this, during the week, there were  20 research talks, coming from a range of topics including lower bounds on formula size and circuit size, complexity measures of Boolean functions, the algorithmic method for proving lower bounds, fixed parameter tractability and hardness magnification, communication complexity and lifting techniques, as well as proof complexity. Some specific results presented include:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>An improved lower bound, after many years, on the number of\n  hyperplanes needed to slice all edges of the Boolean hypercube.\n</li><li> A lower bound for monotone arithmetic circuit size using\n  techniques from communication complexity.\n</li><li>A new potential technique for de Morgan formula lower bounds.\n</li><li> More refined notions of unambiguous certificate complexity and\n  block sensitivity, with a separation that lifts to communication complexity.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe titles and abstracts of all the talks appear later in this report.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition, there was a rump session with short talks by Amit Chakrabarti, Amit Sinhababu, and Prahladh Harsha. \n</p> \n <p>\nOn the social interactions front, in the designated coffee slots there were some meet-random-people-in-a-break-out sessions. The traditional Wednesday hike was replaced by a \"virtual hike\" using Google Earth imagery, that went over one of the shorter hike trails near Schloss Dagstuhl and then virtually visited some participants' institutes. The \"wine-cheese-music party\"\nbecame an online party on gather.town following the Schloss Dagstuhl map, and included music, games, and a commentary on the hardness of travelling. \n </p> \n <p>\nThe organizers, Anna G\u00e1l, Meena Mahajan, Rahul Santhanam, and Till Tantau,  thank all participants for the many contributions they made. We would also like to especially thank the Dagstuhl staff for their cooperation in the current challenging circumstances, their encouragement for going ahead with an online event, and their unstinted help with organizational matters. We would also like to thank Max Bannach for his invaluable help assembling and preparing this report.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Anna G\u00e1l, Meena Mahajan, Rahul Santhanam, and Till Tantau\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Epistemic Planning",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar brought together three largely independent research communities: Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), Knowledge Representation  and Reasoning (KR&amp;R, subsequently KR) and Automated Planning. All three communities have a tradition of investigating the interaction between dynamical systems and epistemic states, but with a different focus and by different means. In the context of this seminar, despite occasional overlap, DEL has mainly investigated the formal semantics of communication and communicative actions, KR&amp;R has mainly focussed on the theories of action and change, and AP has mainly focussed on computational techniques to automatically generate plans. This seminar aimed to encourage and nurture increasing synergies between these three strong and largely independent research communities leading to frameworks for Epistemic Planning: planning with epistemic states, actions, and goals. The seminar succeeded in strengthening and broadening the cross-disciplinary research community that emerged after a prior Dagstuhl Seminar on the subject, entitled \"Planning with Epistemic Goals\", that was held in January 2014 (seminar number 14032). This follow-up seminar led to a better understanding and articulation of commonalities, synergies, and deficits between the DEL, KR and Planning communities.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main components of the seminar were tutorial talks and group work. There were four tutorials, by Andreas Herzig, Bernhard Nebel, Tran Cao Son and Ramaswamy Ramanujam. The four tutorial talks presented epistemic planning from the perspective of four different research communities. Andreas Herzig presented epistemic planning from a knowledge representation perspective, Bernhard Nebel from a classical planning perspective, Tran Cao Son from a theories of action and change perspective, and Ramaswamy Ramanujam from a distributed systems and temporal logic perspective. Abstracts for the four tutorials are included in Section 3.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe group work was performed in five separate working groups, each addressing a distinct important objective in epistemic planning of shared interest to  the DEL, KR and Planning communities. Specifically, the five groups worked on (1) <em> Developing Benchmarks for Epistemic Planning</em>, (2) <em>Exploring Action Types and their Representations</em>, (3) <em>Exploring the Relations Between Knowledge and Belief in Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning</em>, (4) <em> Practical Tools, Resources and Computational Techniques</em>, and (5) <em> Correspondence Between Planning Problems and Games</em>. These group themes are briefly described below, and the outcome of the work in each group is documented in Section 4.\n</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>Developing Benchmarks for Epistemic Planning.</b> In the planning community benchmarks are common, but in the epistemic planning community they are not. The overall goal of the group working on this theme was to formulate a list of ten benchmark epistemic planning problems, in view of setting goals that can evolve into competitions. In particular, the focus was on targeting planning problems that are truly epistemic, meaning problems in which the epistemic dimension - knowledge and ignorance - cannot easily be disregarded. \n\nGuiding questions for the work in this group were: What problems help define and circumscribe what we are studying? What are specific tasks that motivate this area of study, e.g. epistemic planning, protocol synthesis, automated diagnosis, verification, and communication? What problems can help drive future research in developing formalisms and implementing systems of epistemic planning? \nWhat are the features of the relevant planning problems in terms of knowledge vs. belief, single- vs. multi-agent, communicative vs. sensing vs. ontic actions, deterministic vs. non-deterministic actions, etc. How do we evaluate \"hardness\" of problems, e.g. in terms of level of nesting of belief/knowledge, types of actions, size of problem, scalability, and quality of solution. Do benchmarks for some of these problems already exist?\n\n</li><li><b>Exploring Action Types and their Representations.</b> It is important to identify and broaden the list of action types relevant to epistemic planning. \nIn terms of communicative actions we can for instance at least distinguish between announcements, questions, requests and instructions. How these actions are best represented is also an important issue. It should be explored whether formalizations in dynamic epistemic logic are appropriate for planning or whether a more simplified way of representing multi-agent actions is needed. The overall goal of the group working on this theme was to identify, classify and possibly broaden the list of action types relevant to epistemic planning, as well as to explore formalisms for representing these action types. \n\nGuiding questions for the work in this group were: What are the relevant distinctions between types of actions, e.g. epistemic vs. ontic, deterministic vs. non-deterministic vs. probabilistic, instantaneous vs. durative, sensing vs. announcements, degree of observability (public, private, semi-private), etc. What formalisms can support expressing and distinguishing between these action types (e.g. DEL, Situation Calculus, Knowledge-based Programs)? How are multi-agent actions represented, in particular how are conflicts between concurrently occurring actions specified, and how is observability of concurrent actions specified in terms of the observability of the constituting actions?  \n</li><li><b> Exploring the Relations Between Knowledge and Belief in Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning.</b> In multi-agent planning an important problem is that knowledge may turn into false belief for some agents after a partially observable action has taken place. This is a problem for several formalisms for epistemic planning, e.g. dynamic epistemic logic, since agents might not be able to recover from false beliefs. It relates to the general issues of devising appropriate formalisms for doxastic planning (treating beliefs instead of knowledge) and how to deal with belief revision in such settings. The overall goal of the work in this group was to identify the theoretical and computational challenges in planning with knowledge vs. planning with belief; when one or the other is appropriate, or both are needed.\n\nGuiding questions for the work in this group were: \nHow are knowledge and beliefs represented and distinguished from representations of the actual world? How do we formally handle that knowledge may turn into false belief after a partially observable action has occurred?  What are the relevant formalisms for planning with knowledge and/or belief and what are their theoretical and computational properties?\nHow do we deal with belief revision in planning? \nAre there specific types of interesting goals for epistemic planning? For example, in planning with beliefs, goals can be about making some agents have false beliefs. This necessitates formalizing false-belief tasks, lying and deception.\n\n</li><li><b>Practical Tools, Resources and Computational Techniques.</b> The goal of the group working on this theme was to identify practical tools and resources that facilitate the development and experimental evaluation of automated techniques for epistemic planning. \n\nGuiding questions for the work in this group were: What tools and computational techniques already exist in epistemic planning? What are the models and formulas used? What are the shortcomings and challenges of these tools and computational techniques? Are there tools or computational techniques from other communities that we are not availing ourselves of to the fullest extent (e.g., for the planning people model checking)? What are the trade-offs between different tools?\nWhat are the computational complexities of the different approaches and under different assumptions.\n\n</li><li><b>Correspondence Between Planning Problems and Games.</b> This working group was introduced as an additional discussion topic during the seminar, since several participants found it very relevant and important to epistemic planning. The issue is that (epistemic) game theory studies many of the same problems as (epistemic) planning, but mainly by separate research communities using separate vocabularies. The goal of the group working on this theme was to establish formal connections between the area of automated planning and the area of game theory.\n\nGuiding questions for the work in this group were: What are the formalisms, tools and results from game theory relevant to automated planning? Symmetrically, what are the formalisms, tools and results from automated planning relevant to game theory? Can problems formulated in one of the settings easily be translated into the other? What is gained and lost in such translations? \n</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Chitta Baral, Thomas Bolander, Sheila McIlraith, and Hans Van Ditmarsch\n                </div> \n",

To address this demand, industry and research are looking into understanding and improving the productivity of individual software developers as well as teams. \nA substantial amount of research has examined the meaning of software productivity over the past four decades. Much of this research introduces particular definitions of productivity, considers organizational issues associated with productivity, or is focused on specific tools and approaches for improving productivity. In fact, many of the seminal work on software productivity is from the 80s and 90s (Peopleware, Mythical Man-Month, Personal Software Process). \n</p> \n <p>\nAt the same time, software development has changed significantly over the past decades with the rise of agile development, distributed development, more rapid release cycles and the high fragmentation of today\u2019s work. Simultaneously the technology available to software engineers has improved with social coding tools like GitHub and StackOverflow and better IDEs. Furthermore, research communities, in particular the HCI and CSCW communities, have made significant advances in supporting knowledge workers to become more productive that one might be able to also transfer to software engineers.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe goal of this seminar was to rethink, discuss, and address open issues of productivity in software development and how to measure and foster productive behavior of software developers. Specifically, we focused on the following questions:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>What does productivity mean for an individual and teams/organizations and how is it measured?\n</li><li> What are the dimensions and factors of productivity?\n</li><li> What are the purposes and implications of measuring productivity?\n</li><li> What are the grand challenges in research on productivity?\n</li></ul> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Thomas Fritz, Gloria Mark, Gail C.

            "title": "Automatic Quality Assurance and Release",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe seminar explored the relationship between DevOps and quality assurance from a software engineering perspective. DevOps has been gaining traction since around 2012, with initiatives formed both in industry and academia. While the importance of DevOps as an enabler in higher quality software is intuitively clear to both industry and academia, we have discussed commonalities in views, but also the challenges that lie ahead for this discipline. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn essence, human factors are very important, because DevOps is not only a technology, it is a way of working and organizing teams. In this light, we have also discussed the resistance that some team members or even entire organisations seem to have towards automating quality assurance through DevOps. Section 4.2 summarizes a group discussion that eventually triggered a set of reflections on this topic of human aspects of DevOps. Yet, we have also discussed how DevOps can be an enabler for onboarding new team members through the availability of a standardized DevOps infrastructure (Section 4.4). The whole group observed the general lack of empirical evidence on the importance and benefits of DevOps in modern software engineering. This final point is tightly connected to another important theme in our discussion: educating software engineers in the ways and associated technologies of DevOps.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe main goal of this seminar was to bridge the knowledge divide on how researchers and industry professionals reason about and implement DevOps for automatic quality assurance. Through the seminar, we have built up a common understanding of DevOps tools and practices, but we have also identified major challenges for this field of research as well as for the teaching of DevOps principles and practices. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis Dagstuhl was a 2.5 day seminar, which we structured around 4 invited talks that served as keynotes to introduce key topics for discussions. These talks, summarized in Sections 3.1 through 3.3, were given at the beginning of each morning and afternoon to inspire topics for further discussions on a given topic. The group split into smaller sub-groups after each keynote, in order to focus discussions and reflections on a specific topic. All these discussions have been summarized in the form of a blog post, while in Dagstuhl, and are provided in this report. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to keynotes and subgroup discussions, we had a plenary session to start the seminar, where each participant had 2 slides for a short introduction; we had a \"speed-dating\" session on Tuesday evening; and we organized a panel discussion about the future of the field on the last morning (Section 6.3). \n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Bram Adams, Benoit Baudry, Sigrid Eldh, and Andy Zaidman\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Network Attack Detection and Defense \u2013 Security Challenges and Opportunities of Software-Defined Networking",
            "data": "\n <p>\nFrom September 4 through 9, 2016, more than 40 researchers from the domains of computer networks and cyber security met at Schloss Dagstuhl to discuss security challenges and opportunities of software-defined networking (SDN).\n</p> \n <p>\nSoftware-defined networking has attracted a great attention both in industry and academia since the beginning of the decade. This attention keeps undiminished. In 2014, IDC predicted that the market for SDN network applications would reach $1.1bn. Especially in industry, the vision of \"programming computer networks\" has electrified many IT managers and decision makers. There are great expectations regarding the promises of SDN. Leading IT companies, such as Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco systems, Dell, Juniper Networks, IBM, and VMware, have developed their own SDN strategies. Major switch vendors already offer SDN-enabled switches. \n</p> \n <p>\nSoftware-defined networking provides a way to virtualize the network infrastructure to make it simpler to configure and manage. It separates the control plane in routers and switches, which decides where packets are sent, from the data plane, which forwards traffic to its destination, with the aim to control network flows from a centralized control application, running on a physical or virtual machine. From this controller, admins can write and rewrite rules for how network traffic, data packets, and frames are handled and routed by the network infrastructure. Routers and switches in a sense become \"slaves\" of this application-driven central server. SDN-enabled networks are capable of supporting user requirements from various business applications (SLAs, QoS, Policy Management, etc.). This is not limited to the network devices of a certain vendor. It can be applied to devices from various vendors if the same protocol is used. Most SDN infrastructure utilizes the widely-used OpenFlow protocol and architecture to provide communication between controllers and networking equipment. \n</p> \n <p>\nSecurity-related aspects of software-defined networking have only been considered more recently. Opinions differ widely. Some believe that the security problems introduced by SDN are manageable - that SDN can even bring security benefits; others think that Pandora's Box has been opened where SDN and SDN-enabled networks can never be secured properly.\n</p> \n <p>\nNo doubt, there are a number of serious security problems as the following examples show. SDN controllers represent single points of failures. The controllers as well as the connections between controllers and network devices might be subject to distributed denial of service attacks. Compromising the central control could give an attacker command of the entire network. The SDN controllers are configured by network operators. Configuration errors can have more complex consequences than in traditional settings because they may unpredictably influence the physical network infrastructure.  Furthermore, the idea of introducing \u2018network applications\u2019 that interact with the controller to modify network behavior seems like a complexity nightmare in terms of required authentication and authorization schemes. Finally, the SDN paradigm is a major turn around with respect to the basic design rules that have made the Internet successful so far, namely a well-defined layered approach. Whereas in today\u2019s world, applications have no say in routing decisions, SDN\u2019s promise for highly flexible and application-tailored networking requires a way for applications to optimize networking decisions for their own benefits. However, it is unclear to what extent fairness can be ensured, how conflicting decisions can be resolved, etc. Along the same line, members of the security community worry about the possibility to intentionally design SDN applications that could eventually be turned into attack weapons or simply be misused by malicious attackers. Whether these fears are substantiated or not is something which has not received any scrutiny so far.\n</p> \n <p>\nOn the other hand, SDN is also considered by many researchers as an effective means to improve the security of networks. SDN controllers can be used, for instance, to store rules about the permission of certain requests which cannot be decided at the level of a single switch or router because this requires full overview over network status or additional information and interactions which are not contained in the current protocol versions. Attacks that can be detected this way are ARP spoofing, MAC flooding, rogue DHCP server, and spanning tree attacks. Also, by enabling the creation of virtual networks per application, people speculate that intrusion detection techniques relying on the modeling of the normal behavior of network traffic will become much easier to implement and more reliable in terms of false positive and negatives. Similarly, SDN apps could offer a very simple and effective way to implement quarantine zones for infected machines without cutting them off completely from the network since the quarantine could be customized at the application level (letting DNS and HTTP traffic for a given machine go through but not SMTP, for instance).\n</p> \n <p>\nThese two contrary facets of SDN security were the key ingredients for an extremely lively and very fruitful seminar. The seminar brought together junior and senior experts from both industry and academia, covering different areas of computer networking and IT security. The seminar started with two invited talks by Boris Koldehofe (TU Darmstadt, DE) and Paulo Jorge Esteves-Ver\u00edssimo (University of Luxembourg, LU) on the basics and security aspects of software-defined networking. After that we organized six working groups to discuss in two rounds the Good and the Bad of using SDN from the security point of view. Based on the outcome of the working groups and a plenary discussion, we formed another four working groups to discuss required research directions. The first six working groups focus on the following issues: (1) centralization in SDN, (2) standardization and transparency, (3) flexibility and adaptability for attackers and defenders, (4) complexity of SDN, (5) attack surface and defense, and (6) novelty and practicability. The research direction working groups dealt with (1) improving SDN network security, (2) a secure architecture for SDN, (3) secure operation in SDN-based environments, and (4) SDN-based security. The discussion in the working groups was supplemented by short talks of participants to express their positions on the topic or to report about ongoing research activities. Based on the talks, discussions, and working groups, the Dagstuhl seminar was closed with a final plenary discussion which summarized again the results from the working groups and led to a compilation of a list of statements regarding the security challenges and opportunities of software-defined networking. The participants agreed that SDN provides new possibilities to better secure networks, but also offers a number of serious security problems which have to be solved for being SDN a successful technology. The outcome of these discussions and the proposed research directions are presented in the following.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Marc C.

            "data": "\n <p>\nResource efficiency is becoming an increasingly important challenge, especially\ndue to the pervasiveness of computing systems and the diminishing returns from\nperformance improvements of process technology scaling. At the same time, many\nimportant applications have nondeterministic specifications or are robust to\nnoise in their execution. They thus do not necessarily require fully reliable\ncomputing systems and their resource consumption can be reduced by introducing\nor exposing approximations.\n</p> \n <p>\nWhile trading correctness for efficiency has been part of computing systems\nsince the early days, it has seen renewed interest in the past decade. Different techniques have been since developed for applying and controlling approximations and the errors they introduce at different levels of the compute stack. Unfortunately, most of these techniques have been applied in isolation, making simplified assumptions about the other levels. It is thus unclear how all the different techniques interact, combine and complement or negate each other to provide end-to-end application benefits.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe aim of this seminar was to bring together researchers from different domains working on approximate computing, algorithms, programming languages, compilers, architecture and circuits, in order to explore open challenges and opportunities and to define cross-area research directions and collaborations relating to an end-to-end application of approximate computing principles across the compute stack.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar consisted of brief presentations by a subset of the participants\nthat covered the entire computing stack from hardware to applications, and that\nfocused on the current challenges. The talks were followed by discussions in breakout groups that first focused on the different application areas of high-performance computing, embedded systems and deep learning, followed by group discussions on particular fundamental and cross-cutting challenges that were\nidentified during the first breakout session.

            "title": "Privacy Protection of Automated and Self-Driving Vehicles",
            "data": "\n <p>\nCooperative, connected and automated mobility (CCAM) has the potential to drastically reduce accidents, travel time, and the environmental impact of road travel. To achieve their goals, connected and automated vehicles (AVs) require extensive data and machine learning algorithms for processing data received from local sensors, other cars, and road-side infrastructure. This immediately raises the question of privacy and data protection. While privacy for connected vehicles has been considered for many years, AV technology is still in its infancy and the privacy and data protection aspects for AVs are not well addressed. The capabilities of AVs pose new challenges to privacy protection, given that AVs have large sensor arrays that collect data in public spaces. Additionally, AVs capture data not only from other vehicles, but also from many other parties (i.e. pedestrians walking along a street) with very limited possibilities to offer notice and choice about data processing policies. Additionally, the driver will not necessarily be the owner of the vehicle and it may be the case that the majority of AVs are owned by fleets.\n</p> \n <p>\nOur seminar reviewed existing technologies, standards, tools, and frameworks for protecting personal information in CCAM, investigated where such existing techniques clash with the requirements of an AV and its data processing, and identified gaps and road-blockers that need to be addressed on the way to deployment of privacy protection in AVs from a legal, technical, and ethical perspective. While we ran only a shortened online version of the originally planned seminar due to COVID pandemic limitations, we made very good progress, in particular towards identifying and structuring the challenges. Future meetings will build on the results and will discuss the different challenges in more depth, prioritize the corresponding road blockers, and push for research to overcome them.\n</p> \n <p>\nDiscussions during the seminar were organized in seven sessions with presentations from renowned experts from industry and academia, and a final discussion that collected and structured outcomes. In the concluding session, we identified four main challenges that we present in this report alongside the talk abstracts. \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>The first challenge is <b>ethics</b> and responsible behavior of companies and other actors that collect and process personal data in such systems. This goes beyond mere regulatory compliance but was seen as a promising path to complement this minimal baseline. Further discussions are required to identify ways to encourage such practices.\n\n</li><li> Second, we discussed how <b>regulation</b> needs to evolve for future CCAM systems in order to establish a stable baseline. A challenge here will be to identify to what extent sector-specific regulation will be needed to address specifics of CCAM and if regulation of future systems is reasonable and possible.\n\n</li><li> A third challenge is the <b>commercial</b> environment. Industry has to meet regulations and financial expectations and sometimes even conflicting goals like privacy and safety. Understanding and narrowing these trade-offs while acknowledging that industry has many such constraints that limit its flexibility requires further investigation.\n\n</li><li> Last but not least, we see a strong progress in the privacy-enhancing <b>technology</b> (PET) as a promising path towards resolving many of the above mentioned problems. At the same time, many PETs have not been designed for the CCAM domain and might not meet its demands in data quality or latency. For this reason, we see the need to further investigate how existing PETs meet CCAM requirements or how they can be developed further to do so.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nGenerally speaking, there is a lack of incentives for enterprises like original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to go beyond the legal minimum requirements to manage personal data in a privacy-respecting manner, to design privacy-preserving products, or to make the use of personal data transparent to the data subject. During our discussions one question became prominent: What could be the motivation for OEMs to do more in the field of data protection that goes beyond the bare minimum of legal compliance? Ethical and trustworthy aspects, as well as reputation and brand image could be worth investigating in answering this question. However, the field is massively interdisciplinary making it necessary to convince other involved disciplines of the value of data protection for the automotive sector. \n</p> \n <p>\nThere are several technical solutions available for protecting privacy and facilitating the privacy-by-design approach. However, the up-scaling of these solutions to larger systems and their integration with existing systems often fails because systems aspects and the related interdisciplinary issues are not taken into account. So, further progress is needed in promoting privacy-friendly system engineering, as well as integrating PETs into complete systems, taking into consideration the special requirements of safety and trust in the automotive domain. Overall, there should be a push for joint efforts to define and deploy technologies that are superior to today's solutions and that are commercially feasible since cost and effort are split amongst many participants.\n</p> \n <p>\nFurther progress is also required for the development of best practices, methodologies, and a requirements standard similar to ISO 21434 that supports the engineering of practical privacy solutions in complex systems. This will give OEMs a proper threshold target and allow for efficient solution finding and re-use. That guidance or standard could be a layer on top of regulation, similar to how the UN ECE R155 regulation requires a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) for which the ISO 21434 standard defines process requirements.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Frank Kargl, Ioannis Krontiris, Natasa Trkulja, Andr\u00e9 Weimerskirch, and Ian Williams\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Multi-Document Information Consolidation",
            "data": "\n <p>\nToday's natural language processing (NLP) systems mainly work on individual text pieces like individual sentences, paragraphs, or documents. For example, most question answering systems require that the answer to a user's questions is provided in a single document, ideally in a single sentence. If the information is scattered across documents, most systems will fail. The capability of current systems to link information across multiple documents is often limited.\n</p> \n <p>\nThis is in strong contrast to how humans answer difficult questions or make complex decisions. We usually read multiple documents on a topic and then infer the answer to the question or we make a decision based on the evidence we found. In most cases, we consolidate the information across multiple sources. Further, considering only one document can create a biased or incomplete view on a topic. Many aspects in our life are open for multiple interpretations and each author must limit which and how to present information in a document. By reading multiple documents, we are able to identify overlaps, differences, and opposing views between authors. Considering and merging these possible opposing views can be a crucial step in everydays decision making. For example, when booking a hotel, one might read multiple user reviews and create an internal understanding of positive and negative aspects of the hotel.\n</p> \n <p>\nAt this 5-day Dagstuhl Seminar, an interdisciplinary collection of leading researchers discussed and develop research ideas that will lead to advanced multi-document information consolidation systems and enable modern NLP systems to profit from a multi-document perspective.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar was centered around four major themes: 1) how to represent information in multi-document repositories; 2) how to support inference over multi-document repositories; 3) how to summarize and visualize multi-document repositories for decision support; and 4) how to do information validation on multi-document repositories. Questions of semantics, pragmatics (author perspectives, argumentation), representation, and reasoning (including spatio-temporal reasoning and entailment) arose across these themes.\n</p> \n <p>\nInformation Representations and Inference are the theoretical foundation that allows systems to extract information from multiple documents and to infer new knowledge. The challenge is to find a representation that can broadly be used. Multiple documents are likely to bring up multiple perspectives and identifying the relations between them is at the heart of multi-document inference.\n</p> \n <p>\nA connection to real applications, used in actual user scenarios, is critical for the advancement of the multi-document information consolidation field. Multi-document systems are especially useful in situations where users must make complex decisions. In such situations, users often search for sources that provide information or arguments for or against certain decisions. Hence, one working group focused on Multi-Document Systems in User Decision Scenarios. In order to provide value to users, the systems must return true statements (accurate syntheses) given all the available context. Otherwise, the user lose their trust in the system. However, the internet is full of statements that are intentionally or unintentionally misleading. So how do we identify these misleading statements and avoid that those are presented to a user without the necessary context? This research question was addressed by a working group focusing on Information Validation for Multi-Document Scenarios.\n</p> \n <p>\nSeminar participants, including established experts and promising young researchers from academia and industry, had the opportunity to present research ideas, to outline their vision regarding the future of multi-document information consolidation technologies, and to collaborate in discussion groups led by the seminar organizers.\n</p> \n <p>\nEach seminar participant joined two themes with regular cross-theme meetings. As the topics are quite novel in the research community, no established terminology and task definition exists. Hence, participants discussed how these tasks can be defined such that these can be scientifically studied. For example, what does it mean to validate a claim? The participants discussed issues with existing approaches and proposed new research topics, that could be the content of a Ph.D. thesis. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe last day of the seminar was used to summarize results and to create collaborations for future research projects. In total, 12 joint research ideas were proposed. For most of the ideas, this is a new collaboration.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Ido Dagan, Iryna Gurevych, Dan Roth, and Amanda Stent\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Natural Language Argumentation: Mining, Processing, and Reasoning over Textual Arguments",
            "data": "\n <p>\nPhilosophers and, in more recent years, theorists working largely within Artificial Intelligence have developed formal computational models of argumentation, how it works, and what makes an argument valid or invalid. This work has made substantial progress in abstract, formal models to represent and reason over complex argumentation structures and inconsistent knowledge bases. Relatively little research, however, has applied these computational models to naturally occurring argumentation in text; nor have Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing substantially examined argumentation in text. Moreover, much of the work to date has studied only domain-specific texts and use-cases. Examples include finding the specific claims made in a scientific paper and distinguishing argumentation from narrative in legal texts.\n</p> \n <p>\nBut there are many uses and applications for automatic processing of the argumentative aspects of text, such as summarizing the argument of a complex court decision, helping a writer to structure an argument, and processing a large corpus of texts, such as blogs or consumer comments, to find arguments within it. To identify and integrate arguments across a corpus is a very significant problem. To address the issues, solve problems, and build applications, tools must be developed to analyze, aggregate, synthesize, structure, summarize, and reason about arguments in texts. Such tools would enable users to search for particular topics and their justifications, to trace through the argument, and to systematically and formally reason about the relations among arguments. However, to do so requires more linguistic sophistication and newer techniques than currently found in NLP. Moreover, NLP approaches must be connected to computational models of argument. The issues and problems have started to receive attention from both communities; for example, legal documents, on-line debates, product reviews, newspaper articles, court cases, scientific articles, and other kinds of text have all been the subject of recent NLP research on argumentation mining and have been tied to computational models.\n</p> \n <p>Because argumentation is an inherently cross-disciplinary topic involving philosophy, psychology, communications studies, linguistics, and computer science, where different interpretations, analyses, and uses of arguments are proposed and applied, for progress in building NLP tools for argumentation there needs to be progress not only within each domain, but in bridging between these various disciplines, Natural Language Processing, and the computational models. This seminar aimed to help build this bridge by bringing together researchers from different disciplines, with the following goals:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>To understand better the specific kinds of tasks that NLP can carry out in argumentation.\n</li><li> To establish a set of domain-specific and cross-domain use-cases that will guide the direction of research in the field.\n</li><li> To understand better how computational argumentation tasks are tied -- or not tied -- to their specific domains, such as scientific papers, legal argumentation, and political discussions, looking for new cross-domain generalizations.\n</li><li> To understand better the technical challenges to success in each of these tasks, and to discuss how the challenges can be addressed.\n</li><li> To develop and explicate specific challenge problems for the integration of argumentation theory and NLP that are beyond the state of the art (but not too much so), and in which success would have the greatest effect on the field.\n</li><li> To provide prototype solutions that address issues in the integration of NLP and argumentation theory, and to outline follow-on development.\n</li><li> To propose or provide preliminary solutions to common open challenges in natural language argumentation (among others: argument retrieval in text, argument summarization, identification of semantic relations among arguments), profiting from the cross-fertilization between researchers coming from the research areas of NLP and formal argumentation.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The seminar was held on 17--22 April 2016, with 40 participants from 14 different countries. The event\u2019s seven sessions included 30 talks, two tutorials and a hands-on \"unshared\" task. The program included several plenary presentations and discussions in smaller working groups. The presentations addressed a variety of topics, as argument mining applied to legal argumentation and to writing support. Collective discussions were arranged for most of these topics, as well as plans for a future interdisciplinary research agenda involving experts from social sciences and psychology.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs a result of the seminar, a number of challenges and open issues have been highlighted:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li>At this stage of maturity of the research area, it is difficult to choose good (possibly new) challenges and to define the task(s) to be addressed by automated systems\n</li><li> Similarly, it is also challenging to precisely define and accomplish annotation task(s) to establish benchmarks and gold standards to test such automated systems\n</li><li> It is essential to the fruitful development of the research area establish an Interdisciplinary outreach, involving social sciences, psychology, and economics.\n</li></ul> \n <p>Addressing these issues and other questions is now on the agenda of the Argument Mining research community.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Elena Cabrio, Graeme Hirst, Serena Villata, and Adam Wyner\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Descriptive Set Theory and Computable Topology",
            "data": "\n <h3>Research area and topics</h3> \n <p>\nDescriptive set theory traditionally studies the complexity of subsets of and functions between Polish spaces (which are the completely metrizable separable spaces). As a mathematical area, it has well-established interactions with set theory and real analysis. Its canonical textbook is Kechris [11].\n</p> \n <p>\nFollowing the developments in (classical) descriptive set theory, also the area of effective descriptive set theory flourished. In a way, this is the result of replacing <em>continuous</em> by computable everywhere, and by replacing arbitrary countable union by effective ones. Here, the canonical textbook is Moschovakis\u2019 [19]. While classical descriptive set theory is trivial on\ndiscrete spaces, the results from effective descriptive set theory on N often generalize results from computability theory. While this is rarely emphasized (see [20] for an exception), one can recover classical descriptive set theory from effective descriptive set theory by relativization \u2013 provided that theorems are phrased in the right way. \n</p> \n <p>\nRecent years have seen a lot of interest in the interplay between descriptive set theory and theoretical computer science going beyond the natural meeting point of effective DST. Four core developments outlined below are particularly relevant for the meeting:\n</p> \n <h3>DST on spaces of interest for TCS</h3> \n <p>\nCertain classes of topological spaces were revealed as applicable to reasoning about the semantics of programming. The most famous example is domain theory, but Escardo\u2019s synthetic topology [6] or the relationship between well-structured transition systems and Noetherian spaces revealed by Goubault-Larrecq [7] were also very influential. The spaces relevant for TCS are often not Hausdorff, and in particular not Polish. Selivanov pioneered the call for a development of descriptive set theory for these spaces [28, 29]. A break-through was achieved by de Brecht [3] with identifying the class of quasi-Polish spaces as a common generalization of Polish spaces and omega-continuous domains, and by showing that many core results of descriptive set theory can be extended to quasi-Polish spaces.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn computable analysis, we typically work with the category of admissible represented spaces (equivalently, with QCB<sub>0</sub>-spaces, i.e. T<sub>0</sub>-quotients of countably-based spaces) [24]. This is a Cartesian-closed category, meaning that we can form function spaces. This is a very natural requirement from a TCS-perspective, but does not preserve being countably-based. How descriptive set theory works on non-countably-based spaces is still a mystery. de Brecht,\nSelivanov and Schr\u00f6der have undertaken initial investigations, in particular into the Kleene-Kreisel spaces in [27, 26, 5]. Hoyrup has shown that even very simple non-countably-based spaces such as O(\u03c9<sup>\u03c9</sup>) exhibit very unfamiliar behaviour compared to the usual DST [8].\n</p> \n <h3>Synthetic DST</h3> \n <p>de Brecht and Pauly observed a connection between synthetic topology (which in turn can be seen as the theory of functional programming [6]), models of hypercomputation and descriptive set theory [22, 23, 4]. This connection opens up the opportunity to apply reasoning styles about models of computation to descriptive set theory. Work by Kihara on the Jayne-Rogers conjecture has shown significant potential of this approach for solving open questions in descriptive set theory [12]. There is also a hope that this theory can connect to other parts of TCS such as descriptive complexity.\n</p> \n <h3>DST and computability theory</h3> \n <p>\nTraditional computability theory, in particular the study of enumeration degrees, was related to the study of topological spaces via the notion of point degree spectrum introduced by Kihara and Pauly [13], building on earlier work by J. Miller [17]. This lets us reason about the degrees of individual points in a topological space, and understand properties of the space in terms of what degrees are realized there. This technique was already used to resolve a\nlong-standing open question by Jayne ([9], also [21]) on the number of sigma-homeomorphism types of Polish spaces in [13].\n</p> \n <p>\nThis connection is bidirectional, and also allows for the application of topological arguments in computability theory. As such, it has inspired a flurry of recent developments in the area of enumeration degrees by J. Miller, M. Soskova and others [2, 18, 1, 16]. Particularly remarkable here is the existence of non-total almost-total enumeration degrees. This is a\npurely recursion-theoretic statement, but the various known proofs all invoke topological arguments such as Brouwer\u2019s Fixed Point theorem, Urysohn\u2019s metrization theorem or Hurewicz\u2019 and Wallmann\u2019s characterization of countably-dimensional Polish spaces.\n</p> \n <p>Of a similar flavour (but the precise connections are still unclear) is the approach to fractal geometry and Hausdorff dimension via effective dimension of points, defined via Kolmogorov complexity [14]. This approach has already been demonstrated to provide strengthening of core results of fractal geometry, in many cases by rendering inessential restrictions to measurable sets. This includes a reproof of known answer to the two-dimensional Kakeyaconjecture\n[15].\n</p> \n <h3>coPolish spaces and computational complexity</h3> \n <p>In general, it seems that computational complexity of algorithms from computable analysis needs second-order complexity (Kawamura and Cook [10]). For certain spaces, however, runtimes of algorithms are still first-order objects [25]. Ongoing work by de Brecht and Schr\u00f6der has shown that this holds for the coPolish spaces, a dual notion to the quasi-Polish spaces. As such, it seems that \u201cspaces where descriptive set theory is well-behaved\u201d is the dual notion to \u201cspaces where complexity theory is well-behaved\u201d. This merits further\nattention by a broader community.\n</p> \n <h3>Seminar structure</h3> \n <p>\nAs our seminar brought together researchers from previously rather disconnected areas, we included several tutorial talks of one hour each to introduce the various facets of our seminar topics to everyone. The talks covered <em>Quasi-Polish spaces</em> (Matthew de Brecht), <em>Quantitative Coding and Complexity Theory of Continuous Data</em> (Martin Ziegler), <em>CoPolish spaces and Effectively Hausdorff spaces</em> (Matthias Schr\u00f6der), <em>New directions in Synthetic Descriptive Set Theory</em> (Takayuki Kihara), <em>Categorical aspects of Descriptive Set Theory</em> (Ruiyuan Chen), <em>Topology reflected in the enumeration degrees</em> (Joseph S. Miller), <em>Point-free Descriptive Set Theory</em> (Alex Simpson) and <em>Borel combinatorics fail in HYP</em> (Linda Westrick).\n</p> \n <p>In addition, we had many short (fifteen minute) talks introducing topics or open questions.\nThe prompt for these talks was \u201cWhat theorem do you want to prove during/following this\nworkshop?\u201d, and we are excited to learn what will come from this in the next months.\n</p> \n <h3>Challenges in hybrid Dagstuhl meetings</h3> \n <p>While the organizers and most participants had grown very accustomed to virtual meetings,\nthe setting for our seminar was decidedly hybrid: About half of the participants were present\nin person, half were participating remotely. The same split applied to the organizing team.\n</p> \n <p>The Dagstuhl team had equipped our main meeting room with multiple cameras and\nmicrophones (including microphones suspended from the ceiling throughout the room to pick\nup audience contributions). The equipment was controlled by several volunteers amongst the\nparticipants, and we are very grateful to Nikolay Bazhenov, Josiah Jacobsen-Grocott and\nEike Neumann for having performed this crucial role. This setup made interactions in the\nlecture theatre between remote and in-person participants almost seamless.\n</p> \n <p>\nA feature we felt was both crucial for a successful Dagstuhl seminar and difficult to\naccomplish in a hybrid setting are the informal discussions taking place in smaller groups.\nOur approach was to make those slightly less informal, and to use the collaboration platform\nSlack for arranging meetings. Slack also served for asking questions somewhat after the talks.\nThis was somewhat successful, and several fruitful discussions involving both remote and\nin-person participants took place. It is difficult to ascertain though how much potential for\nadditional discussions remained untapped.\n</p> \n <h3>References</h3> \n <ol>\n<li>Uri Andrews, Hristo A.

            "data": "\n <h3>About the Seminar</h3> \n <p>\nData structures provide ways of storing and manipulating data and \ninformation that are appropriate for the computational model at hand.\nEvery such model relies on assumptions that we have to keep questioning.\nThe aim of this seminar was to exchange ideas for new algorithms and data structures, and to discuss our models of computations in light of recent technological advances. This Dagstuhl seminar was the 12th in a series of loosely related Dagstuhl seminars on data structures.\n</p> \n <h3>Topics</h3> \n <p>The presentations covered both advances in classic fields, as well as new models for recent trends in computing, in particular the appearance of big-data applications. \n</p> \n <p>The talks by Brodal (\u00a73.5), Penschuck (\u00a73.19), Silvestri (\u00a73.29), and Vahrenhold (\u00a73.31) covered methods in the <em>external-memory model</em> that models the situation that data does no longer fit into internal memory. This limit can be pushed a bit further by using succinct data structures, which use only as much memory as absolutely necessary. Such methods were covered in the talks of Hagerup (\u00a73.14), Raman (\u00a73.25), and Gog (\u00a73.12). If the task is to generate large random instances, Even (\u00a73.9) showed that one can delay generation of large parts until they really become requested.\n</p> \n <p>\nBig-data applications rely on <em>parallel</em> computation to speed up processing. Bingmann (\u00a73.4) announced the creation of a new framework to simplify developing such applications. Brodnik (\u00a73.6) presented a parallel string-searching algorithm. Since such methods are often used in a distributed setting, the cost of <em>communication</em> can become dominating. Sanders\n(\u00a73.24) discussed several algorithms from this point of view. \n</p> \n <p>\nIacono (\u00a73.15) and Mehlhorn (\u00a73.18) reported on recent advances in the long-standing open problem of <em>dynamic optimality</em> of binary search trees (BSTs). The classic problem of finding <em>optimal</em> static <em>BSTs</em> was taken up by Munro (\u00a73.21): it becomes significantly harder if the objective is to minimize the number of <em>binary</em> comparisons instead of the classic ternary comparisons.\n</p> \n <p>\nWild (\u00a73.32) used the connection between BSTs and recursion trees of Quicksort to analyze Quicksort on inputs with equal keys, including multi-way partitioning Quicksort. The latter was discussed in detail by Aum\u00fcller (\u00a73.3) who presented a novel analysis for comparison-optimal partitioning.\n</p> \n <p>\nNeumann (\u00a73.22) introduced a new randomized dictionary implementation based on\njumplists. Kopelowitz (\u00a73.17) showed a much simplified solution to the file-maintenance problem.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the context of large sparse graphs, Andoni (\u00a73.2), Fagerberg (\u00a73.10), and Sun (\u00a73.30) showed how to exploit special structure in the input for algorithmic applications. Pettie (\u00a73.28) showed how to efficiently answer connectivity queries in graphs when vertices can be deleted. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar also enjoyed contributions on new algorithms: two innovative applications of hashing were presented by Silvestri (\u00a73.29) and Jacob (\u00a73.16); Meyer auf der Heide (\u00a73.20) applied the primal-dual approach for <em>online algorithms</em> to online leasing problems. Driemel (\u00a73.7) reported on clustering methods for time series.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe theory-focused talks were complemented by broader perspectives from practice: Ajwani (\u00a73.1) presented his vision for future communication tools that are supported by context-sensitive agents, and Sedgewick (\u00a73.27) sketched his views on the future of higher education. Finally, Salinger (\u00a73.26) summarized the approaches taken by SAP to include data-specific algorithms directly in their HANA database system.\n</p> \n <p>\nNew models of computation were also discussed. Owens (\u00a73.23) explained how the\narchitecture of graphic cards calls for different approaches to design data structures; D\u00fctsch (\u00a73.8) discussed the cost of virtual address translation in several algorithms. Finally, Farach-Colton (\u00a73.11) and Graefe (\u00a73.13) challenged the claim that data structures are independent of the application they are used in: they showed intriguing examples where the context a\ndata structure was applied in entailed unforeseen additional requirements.\n</p> \n <h3>Final Thoughts</h3> \n <p>\nThe organizers would like to thank the Dagstuhl team for their continuous support; the welcoming atmosphere made the seminar both highly productive and enjoyable. They also thank all participants for their contributions to this seminar.</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Alejandro Lopez-Ortiz, Ulrich Carsten Meyer, Markus E.

            "title": "Blockchain Security at Scale",
            "data": "\n <p>The security of blockchain-based systems has attracted great interest in the research community following the initial financial success of Bitcoin. Several security notions for blockchain-based systems have been proposed, varying in degree of formality and applicability to real-world systems. However, a major blind spot remains about the environment surrounding blockchain-based systems. This environment is typically assumed to be static (irresponsive to activities of the blockchain system). This is a sound starting point for security analysis while the stakes involved are small compared to the environment (i. e., the global economic and political system). However, if blockchain-based systems truly offer compelling advantages over legacy systems, they may eventually become the dominant form of organizing certain social choice problems. This \u201escale change\u201c challenges the assumption that the blockchain-based system remains below the threshold of relevance for the parts of its environment that are vital for its security. One instance where this may already occur is the influence of mining puzzles on hardware design and electricity prices.</p> \n <p>The purpose of the seminar was to bring together researchers with expertise in various subfields of blockchain-based systems to jointly revisit security foundations. The primary goal was to incorporate explicit consideration of reciprocity effects between properties of cryptocurrency protocols and their environment. </p> \n <p>The primary intended outcome of this seminar was proposing a new design principle, viewing security as a key scalability property to consider in addition to performance and efficiency. Second, the seminar aimed to converge on standard terminology for security notions that are robust to scale. Third, we applied this new methodology to Bitcoin specifically as a test case, producing a sort-of \"break glass in case of rampant runaway growth\" security plan.</p> \n <p>Specific questions were:</p> \n <ol>\n<li><b>From micro-level to macro-level incentives:</b> Bitcoin's ecosystem remains small relative to large multinational corporations. What happens to incentives when a cryptocurrency reaches a scale similar to large national economies?\n\n</li><li><b>Cryptographic agility:</b> How does the ability to upgrade cryptographic algorithms might change in the future as cryptocurrency protocols become widely embedded in hardware and/or codified in the law?\n\n</li><li><b>Reciprocity effects on hardware design:</b> How will the hardware industry be affected by the increasing importance of superior hardware for mining, and possibly trusted execution environments (TEE) in the future?\n\n</li><li><b>Mining economics at scale:</b> How will mining economics change in the future, in particular, dynamics between miners at large-scale power consumption levels, with mass availability of cheap commodity mining hardware (including TEE-based), and with different incentives, e.g., in a high-valued fee-only revenue model.\n\n</li><li><b>Reconsidering non-monetary incentives:</b> Can cryptocurrencies be resilient to disruptive nation-level attacks that are not due to monetary incentives?\n\n</li><li><b>Governance at scale:</b> To date, cryptocurrencies largely rely on informal leadership from a small group of influential software developers. Can this be translated into a more democratic model? What does democratic control mean for a cryptocurrency when the <em>demos</em> is not clearly defined?</li></ol> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Rainer B\u00f6hme\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nFair division has been an active field of research in economics and mathematics for decades. More recently, the topic has attracted the attention of computer scientists, due to its algorithmic nature and its real-world applications. There had been a first Dagstuhl Seminar on fair division, in 2007, and none since. The aim of the 2016 Dagstuhl seminar on fair division was to bring together top researchers in the field, from among the multiple disparate disciplines where it is studied, both within computer science and from economics and mathematics, to share knowledge and advance the state of the art.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar covered fair division of both divisible and indivisible goods, with a good mix between economics and computer science (with a significant number of talks being about economics <em>and</em> computer science). Topics included algorithms, lower bounds, approximations, strategic behavior, tradeoffs between fairness and efficiency, partial divisions, alternative definitions of fairness, and practical applications of fair division. The ratio between the number of participants with a main background in computer science and in economics was about 3--1, with a couple of participants with another main background (mathematics or political science). This ratio is similar to the corresponding ratios for Dagstuhl seminars on computational social choice (2007, 2010, 2012, 2015). \n</p> \n <p>\nThe seminar started by a short presentation of the participants (3 minutes per attendee). The rest of the seminar was composed of technical sessions with regular talks, and discussion sessions distributed over the full week (Tuesday morning, Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday morning, Friday morning). One of these discussion sessions was specifically about <em>Fair division in the real world</em>, two were about open problems, and one was about high-level thoughts about the topic and its future. Moreover, there was a significant amount of time left for participants to interact in small groups.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Yonatan Aumann and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lang and Ariel D.

            "data": "\n <h3>Brief Introduction to the Topic</h3> \n <p>Propositional satisfiability (or Boolean satisfiability) is the problem of determining whether the variables of a Boolean formula can be assigned truth values in such a way as to make the formula true. This satisfiability problem, SAT for short, stands at the crossroads of logic, graph theory, computer science, computer engineering and computational physics. Indeed, many problems originating from one of these fields typically have multiple translations to satisfiability.\nUnsurprisingly, SAT is of central importance in various areas of computer science including algorithmics, verification, planning, hardware design and artificial intelligence. It can express a wide range of combinatorial problems as well as many real-world ones.\n</p> \n <p>\nSAT is very significant from a theoretical point of view. Since the Cook-Levin theorem, which identified SAT as the first <b>NP</b>-complete problem, it has become a reference for an enormous variety of complexity statements. \nThe most prominent one is the question \"is <b>P</b> equal to <b>NP</b>?\"\nProving that SAT is not in <b>P</b> would answer this question negatively.\nRestrictions and generalizations of the propositional satisfiability problem play a similar r\u00f4le in the examination of other complexity classes and relations among them. In particular, quantified versions of SAT (QSAT, in which Boolean variables are universally or existentially quantified) as well as variants of SAT in which some notion of minimality is involved, provide prototypical complete problems for every level of the polynomial hierarchy.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the past three decades, an impressive array of diverse techniques from mathematical fields, such as propositional and first-order logic, model theory, Boolean function theory, complexity, combinatorics and probability, has contributed to a better understanding of the SAT problem. Although significant progress has been made on several fronts, most of the central questions remain unsolved so far.\n</p> \n <p>\nOne of the main aims of the Dagstuhl seminar was to bring together researchers from different areas of activity in SAT so that they can communicate state-of-the-art advances and embark on a systematic interaction that will enhance the synergy between the different areas.\n</p> \n <h3>Concluding Remarks and Future Plans</h3> \n <p>The organizers regard the seminar as a great success.\nBringing together researchers from different areas of theoretical computer science fostered valuable interactions and led to fruitful discussions.\nFeedback from the participants was very positive as well.\nMany attendants expressed their wish for a continuation.\n</p> \n <p>\nFinally, the organizers wish to express their gratitude toward the Scientific Directorate of the Center for its support of this seminar, and hope to be able to continue this series of seminars on <em>SAT and Interactions</em> in the future.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Olaf Beyersdorff, Nadia Creignou, Uwe Egly, and Heribert Vollmer\n                </div> \n",

            "title": "Temporal Graphs: Structure, Algorithms, Applications",
            "data": "\n <p>\nTraditionally, graphs (composed of vertices and edges) are used to abstractly model diverse real-world systems, where vertices and edges represent elementary system units and some kind of interactions between them, respectively. \nHowever, in modern systems this modeling paradigm using static graphs may be too restrictive or oversimplifying, as interactions often change over time in a highly dynamic manner. The common characteristic in all these application areas is that the system structure, i.e., graph topology, is subject to <em>discrete changes over time</em>. In such dynamically changing graphs the notion \nof <em>vertex adjacency</em> needs to be revisited and various graph concepts, e.g., reachability and connectivity,  now crucially depend on the exact temporal ordering of the edges' presence. Furthermore, the rate and/or degree of the \nchanges is generally too high to be reasonably modeled in terms of network faults or failures: in these systems changes are not anomalies but rather an integral part of the nature of the system.\n</p> \n <p>\nA <em>temporal graph</em> is a graph which changes over time. Although many different variations for the model of temporal graphs exist, the most common one concerns graphs whose vertex set is fixed while the edge set changes over time. According to this model, given a static underlying graph G, a temporal graph is obtained by assigning to every edge of G a set of nonnegative integer time-labels, indicating the discrete time steps in which this edge is active. Many notions and algorithms on static (i.e., non-temporal) graphs can be transferred in a natural way to their temporal counterpart, while in other cases new approaches are needed to define the appropriate temporal notions. In most cases, the existence of the time dimension adds some degree of freedom in defining a specific temporal variant of a static problem. \n</p> \n <p>\nThe purpose of this one-week seminar was to present and discuss recent advances in the area of temporal and dynamically changing graphs, and to identify and highlight some of the current key challenges to better understand the multiple facets of the computational complexity of temporal graph problems. The seminar was mostly rooted in the rich and mature experience with algorithmic problems on static (i.e., traditional) graphs and in the general quest to understand the computational complexity of temporal versions of fundamental graph problems and algorithms. \n</p> \n <p>Four key areas had been identified, which constituted the backbone of the seminar:</p> \n <ul>\n<li><b>Models, Concepts, Classes.</b> Transferring problems from static to temporal graphs in a meaningful way is a challenging task, with potentially several well-motivated models in the temporal setting corresponding to the same static graph problem. Since temporal graph problems are notoriously hard, a natural way to approach this issue is to restrict input instances. One of the most immediate ways to restrict inputs (which originates in the static algorithmic graph theory) is to restrict the family of underlying graphs G.\nHowever, in temporal graphs, the temporal dimension offers so much structure that one can encode hard problems without the need of a sophisticated structure in the underlying graph or in any single layer. This observation suggests that restrictions of the \u201ctemporal pattern\u201d, i.e., of the way in which the time-labels appear (either alone or in combination with the above mentioned restrictions) can often help to identify tractable special cases of temporal graph problems.\n</li><li><b>Concrete Algorithmic Problems.</b> There are many examples of canonical generalizations from classic optimization problems on static graphs to temporal graphs. The most meaningful way in which a temporal version of a classic optimization problem may be defined crucially depends on the underlying application domain. Generally, temporal variants tend to become computationally harder than the corresponding classic optimization problem. Canonical ways to tackle the computational hardness are to (i) restrict the input instances to certain graph classes that allow for efficient (exact) algorithms or find\nparameters that allow for fixed-parameter algorithms, (ii) aiming for polynomial-time approximation algorithms where a certain level of solution quality is guaranteed, or (iii) combining (i) and (ii).\n</li><li><b>Distributed Aspects.</b> A common approach to analyzing distributed algorithms is the characterization of necessary and sufficient conditions to their success. These conditions commonly refer to the communication model, synchronicity, or structural properties of the network (e.g., is the topology a tree, a grid, a ring, etc.) In a highly-dynamic network, the topology changes during the computation, and this may have a dramatic effect on computation. The study of this impact has led the distributed algorithms community to define a number of classes of temporal graphs that capture various levels of  regularities a graph may satisfy over time, regardless of its structure at any single instant. It turns out that some of these properties \u2013 in particular the ones pertaining to finite time \u2013 are also relevant in a (centralized) algorithmic setting and have an impact on the computational complexity (or feasibility) of classic problems. In particular, properties like periodicity,\ntemporal connectivity, and bounded temporal diameters have been considered both in the distributed and in the non-distributed settings. The seminar played here a crucial role in allowing the different communities to meet and share their complementary experience of temporal properties, as well as to converge on terminology and modeling aspects.\n</li><li><b>Applications.</b> Whenever there is a situation with pairwise interactions and information about the time point when these interactions happen, the framework of temporal graphs offers a natural mathematical model. This is especially the case in applications where the time information is critical. Examples include traffic and transportation networks, social\nnetwork analysis (especially when analyzing disease or rumor spreading phenomena), biological networks, mobile sensor networks, and neural networks. All these application areas have their own problem settings and problem instances with specific properties and, in order to apply the fast-developing theory of algorithms for temporal graphs, it is essential to identify and formalise the properties of temporal graphs derived from data sets in these application areas, with the goal of obtaining application-driven restrictions of the input instances that allow for efficient algorithms. Among other application-oriented talks, the seminar included two highly topical talks relating to the role of temporal graphs in pandemic modelling.\n</li></ul> \n <p>The Dagstuhl Seminar 21171 \"Temporal Graphs: Structure, Algorithms, Applications\" brought together 53 participants from 13 different countries in Europe, USA, Japan, and Israel. The list of participants and speakers contained international experts in algorithms and complexity, social networks and computational social choice, complex systems, distributed algorithms, and parameterized algorithmics. We had in total 21 talks, each of approximately 30 minutes duration, and two sessions where open problems were proposed and discussed. \n</p> \n <p>\nAs this Dagstuhl Seminar was held entirely online (which would be unheard of a few years ago), we provided access to all participants to the online platform GatherTown which enabled us to virtually interact in a way which simulated \n(very satisfactory) physical meetings and interaction (e.g., also having virtual boards at our disposal). We had the GatherTown platform open every day all day (from the morning until the night), while we specified slots of 2-hours daily where everybody was expected to come to GatherTown. The rest of the day, GatherTown was there to facilitate all people who wanted to have extended physical-looking scientific meetings. During the Seminar, collaborative work was encouraged over all formal and informal scientific discussions. \nBy building on the pre-existing synergies between the participating researchers, new collaborations have been initiated and old ones have been reinforced, and this across all all the communities which were represented in the Seminar.\n</p> \n <p>\nTo conclude, this Seminar has been successful in bringing together scientists from different backgrounds and initiating or strengthening research \ncollaborations on the wide topic of temporal and dynamically changing graphs. Last, but not least, these collaborations and scientific discussions \npresented a fruitful mix between young researchers, such as PhD students, with older and established researchers in the general field of temporal graphs.\n</p> \n <p>\nWe would like to express our special gratitude to the team of Schloss Dagstuhl who were extremely supportive and also flexible on how to \norganize a virtual Dagstuhl Seminar during these unprecedented times of the pandemic, without compromising the scientific quality and the overall participation experience of the Seminar.\n</p> \n <h3>Acknowledgments</h3> \n <p>The organizers are very grateful to\nHendrik Molter and Malte Renken (TU Berlin) for helping in organizing\nthe seminar (program compilation, technical support during the seminar,\netc.) and to William Petterson and John Sylvester (University of\nGlasgow) for their help in collecting the material and compiling this\nreport.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 4.0\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 4.0\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Arnaud Casteigts, Kitty Meeks, George B.

            "data": "\n <p>\nThis seminar was the sixth in a series of Dagstuhl \"Scheduling\" seminars (since 2008). Scheduling is a major research field that is studied from a practical and theoretical perspective in computer science, mathematical optimization, and operations research. Applications range from traditional production scheduling and project planning to the newly arising resource management tasks in the advent of internet technology and shared resources. \n</p> \n <p>\nThis edition of the seminar focused on the interplay \nbetween scheduling problems and problems that arise in the management of traffic. There are several notable aspects of the scheduling problems that arise particularly in this context: \n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> the role of dynamic decision-making in which data-driven approaches emerge (especially those that have stochastic elements in modelling multi-stage decision-making);\n</li><li> the interplay between scheduling aspects and what might be viewed as routing aspects, providing a spacial component to the nature of the scheduling problem;\n</li><li> the tension between questions of coordination and competition that arise from the fact that, for many of the issues in this domain, there are significant questions that depend on the extent to which the traffic can be centrally coordinated.\t\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nSince the community working on the intersection of scheduling and traffic is itself rather broad, the seminar focused on researchers whose methodological focus relies on tools from the theoretical design of algorithms, on mathematical optimization methods, \nand on the combination of optimization and game-theoretic approaches.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Organization of the Seminar.</b> The workshop brought together $59$ researchers from theoretical computer science, mathematical optimization and operations research. The participants consisted of both senior and junior researchers, including a number of postdocs and advanced PhD students.\n</p> \n <p>\nDuring the five days of the workshop, 31 talks of different lengths took place. Four keynote speakers gave an overview of the state-of-the art of the respective area in 60 minutes:\n</p> \n <ul>\n<li> Shuchi Chawla: Mechanisms for resource allocation\n</li><li> Benjamin Moseley: Combinatorial Optimization Augmented with Machine Learning\n</li><li> \u00c9va Tardos: Learning in Games and in Queueing Systems\n</li><li> Vera Traub: Approximation algorithms for traveling salesman problems.\n</li></ul> \n <p>\nThe remaining slots were filled with shorter talks of $30$ minutes on various topics related to scheduling, routing, transportation, mechanism design, learning, and applications in practice. Another highlight of the workshop was a historical note given by Jan Karel Lenstra with his view on the dynamic development of the area of scheduling in the past 60 years.\nFurther, in the beginning of the week, open problem sessions were held. Throughout the week, a few sessions with spotlight talks of $8$ minutes gave participants the chance to announce recent results and invite for discussions. The schedule left  ample free time that was actively used for fruitful discussions and joint research.\n</p> \n <p>\n<b>Outcome.</b> Organizers and participants regard the workshop as a great success. The workshop achieved the goal to bring together the related communities, share the state-of-the art research and discuss the current major challenges. The talks were excellent and very stimulating; participants actively met in working groups in the afternoon and evenings. It was remarked very positively that a significant number of younger researchers (postdocs and PhD students) participated and integrated very well.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe organizers wish to express their gratitude towards the Scientific Directorate and the administration of the Dagstuhl Center for their great support for this workshop.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Nicole Megow, David Shmoys, and Ola Svensson\n                </div> \n",

            "data": "\n <p>\nThe intent  of this 5-day Seminar was to develop a general theory of graph polynomials. Graph polynomials have played a key role  in combinatorics and its applications, having effected breakthroughs in conceptual understanding and brought together different strands of scientific thought. The characteristic and matching polynomials advanced graph-theoretical techniques in chemistry; the Tutte polynomial married combinatorics and statistical physics, and helped resolve long-standing problems in knot theory. The area of graph polynomials is  incredibly active, with new applications and new graph polynomials being discovered each year. \nHowever, the resulting plethora of techniques and results now urgently requires synthesis. Beyond catalogues and classifications we need a comparative theory. \n</p> \n <p>\nThere is a long history in this area of results in one field leading to breakthroughs in another when techniques are transferred, and this Seminar leveraged that paradigm. More critically, experts in the field have recently begun noticing strong resonances in both results and proof techniques among the various polynomials. The species and genera of graph polynomials are diverse, but there are strong interconnections: the Seminar initiated work on creating a general theory that will bring them together under one family. The process of developing such a theory of graph polynomials should expose deeper connections, giving great impetus to both theory and applications. This has immense and exciting potential for all those fields of science where combinatorial information needs to be extracted and interpreted.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe Seminar provided conditions ripe for cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in graph theory and topological graph theory, in logic and finite model theory, and in current biocomputing and statistical mechanics applications.  \nDuring the Seminar the participants were offered a conspectus of the broad area of graph polynomials. The view was confirmed that a synthetic approach is needed in order to see the wood for the trees. The discussions and collaborations initiated at the workshop promise well for the development of a unified theory of graph polynomials. This Seminar represented a convincing beginning, and, hopefully,\nsimilar meetings in future will further the envisaged project.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn the light of our stated goals, the Seminar provided ample time for discussion groups and tutorials. The participants (44) of the Seminar included some of the leading experts in combinatorics, knot theory, matroid theory and graph polynomials from Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia. The composition of participants was both age and gender balanced with a quarter of the participants being women.\nThe younger researchers (more than a quarter of the participants) profited\nfrom intense contacts and discussions with their more experienced colleagues.\nAn inspiring problem session brought about particular directions for further research.\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Jo Ellis-Monaghan, Andrew Goodall, Johann A.

            "title": "Computational Proteomics",
            "data": "\n <p>\nThe Dagstuhl Seminar 17421 \"Computational Proteomics\" discussed in-depth the current challenges facing the field of computational proteomics, while at the same time reaching out across the field's borders to engage with other computational omics fields at the joint interfaces. The issues that were discussed reflect the emergence of novel applications within the field of proteomics, notably proteogenomics (the identification of proteins based on sequence data obtained from prior genomics and/or transcriptomics analyses), and metaproteomics (the study of the combined proteome across an entire community of (micro-)organisms). These two new proteomics approaches share several challenges, which predominantly revolve around the sensitive identification of proteins from large databases while maintaining an acceptably low false discovery rate (FDR). The ramifications of these issues, and possible solutions, were first introduced in short but thought-provoking talks, followed by a plenary discussion to delineate the initial discussion sub-topics. Afterwards, working groups addressed these initial considerations in great detail. \n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition, both proteogenomics and metaproteomics suffer from coverage issues, as neither is currently capable of providing anywhere near a complete view on the true complexity of the (meta-)proteome. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the true extent of the proteome remains unknown, and is likely to be time-dependent as well. As a result, a separate working group was created to discuss the issues and possible remedies related to proteome coverage.\n</p> \n <p>\nThe field of proteomics has, however, not only extended into novel application areas, but meanwhile also continues to see a strong development of novel technologies. Over the past few years, the most impactful of these is data-independent acquisition (DIA), which comes with its own unique computational challenges. On the one hand, the analysis of DIA data currently relies heavily on spectral libraries, which have so far been a rather niche product in proteomics (as opposed to, for instance, metabolomics, where spectral libraries have a much longer and much more fruitful history), while on the other hand, FDR estimation remains contested in DIA approaches. As a result, two further working groups were established during the seminar, one on the applications for, and methods to create spectral libraries, and the other on the specific challenge of calculating a reliable FDR when performing spectral library searching.\n</p> \n <p>\nAnother key topic of the seminar was the (orthogonal) re-use of public proteomics data, which focused on the provision of metadata for the assembled proteomics data, as this is the key bottleneck facing researchers who wish to perform large-scale re-analysis of public proteomics data, especially when the objective is to obtain biological knowledge. A working group was therefore created to explore the issues with metadata provision, and to explore means to ameliorate the current suboptimal metadata reporting situation.\n</p> \n <p>\nThroughout the seminar, the topic of visualizing the acquired data and the obtained results cropped up with regularity. A corresponding working group was therefore set up to delineate the state-of-the-art in proteomics data visualization, and to explore the issues with, and opportunities of advanced visualizations in proteomics.\n</p> \n <p>\nAs a last core topic, a short introductory talk and subsequent working group was dedicated to the education of computational proteomics researchers, with special focus on their ability to work at the interfaces with other omics fields (genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics). This working group assembled an extensive list of already available materials, along with  an overview of the different roles and specializations that can be found across informaticians, bio-informaticians, and biologists, and how each field should evolve in order to bring these more closely together in the future.\n</p> \n <p>\nIn addition to abovementioned topic introduction talks, and the associated working groups, two talks illustrated specific topics of the seminar. Paul Wilmes showed his recent work in bringing metaproteomics together with advanced metatranscriptomics and metagenomics, showing that the flexible use of sequence assembly graphs at the nucleotide level opens up many highly interesting possibilities at the proteome level through enhanced identification. Nevertheless, it was observed that there is strong enrichment for genes with unknown function at the protein identification level, highlighting quite clearly that we have yet to achieve a more complete biochemical understanding of microbial ecosystems. Finally, Magnus Palmblad delighted the participants with a highly original talk on the exploration of mass spectrometry data (of both peptides as well as small molecules) through the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste).\n</p> \n <div>\n<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">\n<img alt=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\" src=\"/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/cc.png\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                        Creative Commons BY 3.0 Unported license\n                    </a>\n</div> \n <div>\n<img alt=\"Copyright\" src=\"https://www.dagstuhl.de/_Resources/Static/Packages/Dagstuhl.Site/Frontend/images/licenses/copy.png?bust=22575bbf\" style=\"width: 1em;\"/>\n\n                    Lennart Martens\n                </div> \n",
